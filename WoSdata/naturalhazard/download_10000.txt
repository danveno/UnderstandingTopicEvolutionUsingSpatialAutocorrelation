TI Dissecting cost-effectiveness analysis for preventive interventions: A
   guide for decision makers
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Decision makers usually limit their use of economic evaluations of preventive interventions to the cost-effectiveness ratio.
   Objective: To show decision makers how economic evaluations can be used to understand the cost-effectiveness of different options for altering health intervention strategies.
   Observations: Cost-effectiveness analysis provides insights into many factors that contribute to the overall benefits, hazards, and costs of interventions. This article reviews how epidemiologic and intervention characteristics, costs, natural history, targeting, and current interventions influence the value of prevention strategies.
   Conclusion: Understanding the factors that contribute to the overall costs and effectiveness of interventions should allow decision makers to better adapt interventions to their needs.

AB Background: Vibroacoustic disease (VAD) is an insidious environmental entity caused by occupational exposure to large pressure amplitude and low frequency (LPALF) noise (greater than or equal to 90 dB SPL, less than or equal to 500 Hz). Significant disabilities may result, and issues of worker's compensation should be openly discussed and settled. Toward this goal, a rigorous review of all available information on this disease was undertaken in order to document the need to define industrial exposure standards, and to settle on the diagnostic procedures that will help distinguish the VAD from other, similar conditions. Methods: We reviewed the medical files of 236 male Caucasians employed as aircraft technicians who had been diagnosed with VAD and monitored for at least 15 yr. The natural history of the disorder was studied in detail, emphasizing the clinical diagnostic criteria and the outcome of disabilities. Results: Among the 236 cases, 172 (73%) were disabled after an average of 24 yr (SD = 6.9) of occupational exposure. The primary categories of disabilities were neurological (81, 34%), malignant (28, 11.9%), psychiatric (23, 9.7%), cardiovascular (16, 6.8%), and osteoarticular (14, 5.9%). After the onset of industrial exposure to LPALF noise, the minimum time for these disabilities to manifest themselves was 16 yr. The most serious complication was multiple attempted suicide. Such attempts were fortunately rare (5, 2.1%) and successful only once. Echocardiograms showed characteristic changes in pericardial structures, involving proliferation of the extracellular matrix, lack of cilia and five pericardial layers instead of three. This has been studied in pericardial biopsy material obtained during coronary bypass surgery for coronary insufficiency (six cases), and by autopsy (four cases). Discussion: These findings appear to be pathagnomonic for the VAD, and the echocardiogram has been confirmed as a fundamental diagnostic tool. The degree of disability due to VAD can be determined from Portuguese national disability tables, which cover almost all of the VAD-induced disabilities. However, these tables do not specify LPALF noise as an occupational hazard, rendering them inapplicable to VAD patients. Also, suicide, a most serious psychiatric consequence, is not covered by these tables. Such situations highlight the absolute necessity to recognize LPALF noise as the cause of VAD, and as an industrial hazard.

DE gypsum karst; subsidence; hazard; planning
ID SUBSIDENCE; SPAIN
AB The rapid underground dissolution of gypsum, and the evolution of the gypsum karst in Lithuania and England, results in subsidence problems which can make construction difficult. The natural dissolution yields sulphate-rich groundwater of poor quality and the karst is susceptible to the rapid transmission of pollutants.
   In the north of Lithuania gypsum karst is developed in Devonian gypsum. Here the towns of Birai, Pasvalys and the surrounding countryside suffer subsidence and some buildings have been damaged. The majority of the potable water in these areas is derived from groundwater extracted from sandstone sequences that underlie the gypsum. In Lithuania conservation measures have been introduced to control agriculture and prevent pollution of the gypsum karst. These measures include environmentally-friendly farming, restrictions on land use and exclusion zones around subsidence hollows.
   In England subsidence caused by the dissolution of Permian gypsum has caused severe problems in the vicinity of the town of Ripen. Numerous buildings have been damaged and new sites are difficult to develop. Here formal planning regulations have recently been introduced to help to protect against the worst effects of subsidence resulting from gypsum dissolution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The clinical progression of chronic hepatitis C is nor uniform throughout the entire period of infection and is more rapid in patients with advanced histologic disease. Our study was designed to identify factors contributing to progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by taking the entire period of infection into consideration. Two hundred thirteen patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis type C chronic Liver disease were included in this study. They did not have either a history of antiviral therapy or any other potential causes of chronic liver disease except for transfusion. Hepatitis C virus genotype Ib was detected in 144 (68%) patients, followed by 2a in 51 (24%). 2b in 11 (5%). la in 4 (2%). and coinfection with Ib and 2a in 3 (1%). The log-rank test in the Kaplan-Meier method revealed that the cumulative percentage of cirrhosis-free or hepatocellular carcinoma-free patients became significantly lower as the transfusion age went up. Patient ape at the time of transfusion was the only independent factor related to disease progression in multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model. Thus age at transfusion should be taken into consideration in designing the optimal follow-up schedule and therapy in patients with posttransfusion-associated chronic hepatitis C.

AB The iterative convex minorant (ICM) algorithm proposed by Groeneboom and Wellner is fast in computing the NPMLE of the distribution function for interval censored data without covariates. We reformulate the ICM as a generalized gradient projection method (GGP), which leads to a natural extension to the Cox model. It is also easily extended to support Tibshirani's Lasso method. Some simulation results are also shown. For illustration we reanalyze two real datasets.

AB We surveyed a series of surface waters and sewage treatment plants in Flanders (north of Belgium) for the presence of estrogenic activity and a xeno-estrogenic compound para-nonylphenol (NP), respectively. The surface waters of rural origin, used for drinking water production, were free of significant levels of estrogenic activity and NP (<1 mu g/L). Domestic sewage, after proper treatment, appeared to be no major source of this chemical. Yet, in some industrial effluents and surface waters of highly industrialized regions, NP and/or estrogenic activity was prominent, that is, <1 to 122 mu g NP/L and 11 to 42 mu g NP/L, respectively; This is because of the ongoing use of NP polyethoxylates in industry. The response of the recombinant yeast estrogen assay to the environmental samples tested was not consistent with the detected concentrations of NP. Standard addition of a natural estrogen, 17 beta-estradiol, generated no or a reduced response compared to the standard curve concentration. Application of humic acids to standard series of NP and 17 beta-estradiol resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of the estrogenic response. It appears that this bioassay is subject to considerable interferences due to the complexity of environmental samples. Parallel implementation of extensive chemical screening for xenobiotics and use of the bioassay are needed for adequate assessment of the potential estrogenic hazard to avoid false negative evaluations.

TI Pathophysiology of bit control in the horse
SO JOURNAL OF EQUINE VETERINARY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of one and often two bits, in traditional or normal horsemanship, constitutes a welfare problem, a hazard to health, and a handicap to performance.
   The bit method of control is invasive, physiologically contraindicated and counterproductive
   A bit often causes discomfort, pain and injury
   It can be responsible for a horse's poor attitude to exercise and many behavioral problems in all types of equitation from dressage (e.g., headshaking) to racing (e.g., dorsal displacement of the soft palate). Horses are happier in a bridle without a bit .
   The bit can be the sole cause of abnormal inspiratory noise (stridor) at exercise
   To govern the speed of a racehorse using a bit and traction on both reins depends on poll flexion, which obstructs the airway and leads to premature fatigue, poor performance, and asphyxia-induced pulmonary edema ("bleeding"). Measurement of jowl angle is recommended as an indicator of upper airway patency
   A bit triggers digestive tract reflexes, which are physiologically opposed to rapid breathing. Horses are being expected to caf and exercise simultaneously, two activities that are mutually exclusive
   As the bit interferes with breathing and as breathing is coupled with locomotion, the bit also interferes with locomotion
   A horse that leans on the bit loses self-carriage, and becomes heavier on the forehand. Its stride becomes shorter and, therefore, slower. In addition, greater stress is placed on the tendons, ligaments,joints and bones of the forelegs. In racing this factor, coupled with fatigue, renders break-downs and fatal accidents more likely
   Resistance to the bit causes rigidity of the neck, which is incompatible with optimum performance, and also reduces the effectiveness of some important energy conservation mechanisms. Human athletes need complete freedom of their neck
   The horse is an obligatory nose-breather. At exercise, a horse's lips should be sealed and mouth closed so that no air enters the digestive tract. A bit breaks this seal and the mouth is Often open
   "Nonacceptance of the bit" includes problems such as buccal ulcers, wolf tooth sensitivity, pain during eruption of cheek teeth, star fractures of the mandible, lacerations of the lip, tongue and gingiva, open mouth, tongue movement, tongue behind the bit, tongue over the bit, 'swallowing the tongue,' 'flipping the palate,', headshaking, fighting the bit, chewing on the bit,'bit between the teeth,' boring, pulling and bolting
   The safety of rider and horse are imperiled when justifiable resentment of bit-induced pain leads a horse to take the bit between its teeth and bolt
   In the practice of natural horsemanship, horses can be controlled for early schooling without a bit, and for advanced schooling with a snaffle. In this way, the above problems can be either solved or minimized, respectively. A new design of bitless bridle, that is neither a hackamore nor a bosal, permits control by painless pressure on the skin behind the ear and facilitates the humane, non- invasive and natural approach, even for advanced schooling.

AB The objective of this study was to conduct a deterministic aquatic ecological risk assessment of copper in surface waters (saltwater) of Europe. A Hazard Quotient (HQ) approach defined as the Observed Environmental Concentration (OEC)/Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was used to measure risk. Hazard Quotiernts greater than one suggest ecological risk and/or the need for additional analysis (probabilistic analysis) or data collection. The dissolved copper concentrations used fbr the OEC values came mainly from areas of the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea and consisted of measured copper concentrations from eight studies in marinas/harbors, ten studies in estuaries, and twenty-two studies in open sea regions. In a majority of cases, the geometric mean of the individual measurements was calculated to represent the typical concentration of dissolved copper expected to occur at that site. The overall geometric means of dissolved copper concentrations we re 1.53, 1.49, 0.68 and 1.07 mu g/l for pooled marinas/harbors, estuaries, coastal/open sea, and all sites, respectively. Maximum mean values by station type were 16, 5.48 and 5.56 mu g/l for marina/harbors, estuaries and open sea/coastal areas, respectively. These copper exposure data are for total dissolved copper and reflect copper contributions from all sources of copper such as natural erosion of earth crust, mining and smelting, municipal and industrial wastewater effluents, pesticides, and antifouling paints. The ecological effects data used far the PNEC were determined from 65 saltwater species (five plants; 36 benthos; 8 zooplankton; and 16 fish) tested in acute studies. The acute 5th percentile (PNEC) for all species (protection level of 95%) was 5.6 mu g/l. Hazard Quotients greater than one were only reported for 3 of 101 stations. All three stations were located in marina areas of either Saronic Gulf of Greece or Arachon Bay of France. Results from this risk assessment demonstrate that the probability of ecological risk from acute dissolved copper exposures in European saltwater environments is generally low.

AB Deep arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain are managed by various therapeutic approaches. The relative benefits of microsurgery and radiosurgery in treating small (<4 mL), deep AVMs continue to be scrutinized in light of improved surgical technique and innovation. The endovascular approach has been useful for the management of larger AVMs, where it is combined most often with microsurgery or, as witnessed most recently in the literature, with radiosurgery. A multidisciplinary decision-making process is warranted in all cases. Certain small AVMs (<1 mL) with arterial feeders poorly accessible to surgical exposure are ideally suited for radiosurgery; otherwise, several issues may pertain to the selection of patients for radiosurgery apart from AVM size or location. The distinguishing feature for treatment of deep AVMs concerns the hazards of radiation exposure to critical neural landmarks. Because the resulting neurologic deficit may be catastrophic, the typical approach has been to reduce the dose in most circumstances. Favorable outcomes, with complete obliteration of the AVM and much-reduced or even absent, radiation-induced symptomatic neural injury, have been reported in the case of small AVMs despite a reduced-dose delivery. The radiosurgical treatment of large AVMs with multiple isocenters (>2) is less ideal and more prone to complications. Present and future directions in the field of radiosurgery regarding AVMs include a better understanding of the radiobiology of the effect of single-dose treatment with the intent of increasing the therapeutic index.

AB This study provides an integrated view of the growth patterns and factors that controlled the evolution of the Gulf of Cadiz continental margin based on studies of the tectonic, sedimentologic and oceanographic history of the area. Seven sedimentary regimes are identified, but there are more extensive descriptions of the late Cenozoic regimes because of the larger data base. The regimes of the Mesozoic passive margin include carbonate platforms, which become mixed calcareous-terrigenous deposits during the Late Cretaceous-early Tertiary. The Oligocene and Early Miocene terrigenous regimes developed, in contrast, over the active and transcurrent margins near the African-Iberian plate boundary. The top of the Gulf of Cadiz olistostrome, emplaced in the Late Miocene, is used as a key horizon to define the 'post-orogenic' depositional regimes. The Late Miocene progradational margin regime is characterized by a large terrigenous sediment supply to the margin and coincides with the closing of the Miocene Atlantic-Mediterranean gateways. The terrigenous drift depositional regime of the Early Pliocene resulted from the occurrence of high eustatic sea level and the characteristics of the Mediterranean outflow currents that developed after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Late Pliocene and Quaternary regimes are dominated by sequences of deposits related to cycles of high and low sea levels. Deposition of shelf-margin deltas and slope wedges correlate with regressive and low sea level regimes caused by eustasy and subsidence. During the highstand regimes of the Holocene, inner shelf prograding deltas and deep-water sediment drifts were developed under the influence of the Atlantic inflow and Mediterranean outflow currents, respectively. A modem human cultural regime began 2000 years ago with the Roman occupation of Iberia; human cultural effects on sedimentary regimes may have equalled natural factors such as climate change. Interplay of tectonic and oceanographic controls dominated the evolution of the Cadiz margin during the Cenozoic. Depositional sequences formed where the tectonic setting provided the accommodation space and the shape of the deposits has been greatly influenced by the strong unidirectional Atlantic inflow currents on the shelf and Mediterranean outflow currents on the slope. The entire cycle of the inflow and outflow deposition along the margin has been controlled first by the tectonic evolution of the Betic and Rif gateways, which become closed during the Late Miocene, and after the Messinian by the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. Strong current development during eustatic sea level highstands of the Pliocene and Quaternary has controlled deposition because of maximum sill depths at Gibraltar for water circulation. Lowstand sea levels slowed circulation and resulted in mud drapes over the slope and regressive stratigraphic sequences over the shelf. More recently, the human industrial revolution has caused heavy metal contamination of sediment and water over the Cadiz margin. Human activity also has affected sedimentation rates because of deforestation that caused increased depositional rates near undammed rivers and decreased rates where rivers have been dammed.
   Future research efforts will need to focus on: (1) the effect of increased Mediterranean outflow caused by river damming plus global warming and the increased outflow as a potential trigger for new ice ages; (2) assessments of geologic hazards for planning man-made shoreline structures,
   developing offshore petroleum resources and maintaining undersea communications cables; and (3) confirmation of the general geologic history of the Cadiz margin. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In Italy, antiretroviral combination therapy was adopted in mid-1995 and protease inhibitors in mid-1996.
   Objective: To conduct a prospective, population-based, observational study to evaluate the effect of these therapies on the survival of persons with AIDS (PWA).
   Methods: PWA living in the Tuscany region diagnosed between 1985 and 31 March 1997 (National AIDS Registry) were studied. Information on antiretroviral drugs, prophylactic treatment, CD4 cell count, and AIDS-defining illnesses was collected for PWA still alive at 1 January 1996 and those diagnosed thereafter (analysis cut-off date, 30 November 1997). Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated by year of diagnosis. A Cox model was then used to estimate the adjusted (by sex, age, HIV exposure category, CD4 cell count, type and number of AIDS-defining illnesses) relative hazard (RH) of death by year of diagnosis and calendar date (considered as a time-dependent variable). Similar analyses were repeated for PWA diagnosed after 1989, having been stratified by disease-specific AIDS condition. A final analysis was performed for PWA still alive at 1 January 1996 or diagnosed thereafter for estimating the effect of single, double and triple combination therapy (time-dependent variables), having adjusted for the above variables and for prophylactic treatment.
   Results: A total of 1683 (79.5%) out of 2118 PWA died before 1 December 1997. Use of more potent combination therapies, including protease inhibitors, greatly increased during 1997. Median survival was 2.9, 12.3, 13.4, 11.4 and 17.6 months for diagnoses before 1987, in 1987-1990, 1991-1993, 1994 and 1995, respectively; an estimated 62% of those diagnosed in 1996-1997 had survived 15 months after diagnosis. The Cox model showed a trend of decrease of RH for calendar time starting in the first half of 1996, compared with 1994. When stratifying by specific AIDS-defining disease there was no statistically significant evidence that the improved overall survival was due to increased survival only for certain diseases. The final multivariate analysis for the 771 PWA still alive at 1 January 1996 or diagnosed thereafter estimated significant RH < 1.0 for double and triple therapy (RH, 0.61 and 0.36, respectively) compared with no therapy.
   Conclusions: A significant reduction in risk of death after AIDS was observed from the second half of 1996, apparently due to the widespread use of antiretroviral combination therapies. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

   for water quality criteria based on hydrological units
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY

AB Local water quality criteria for selenium should be based on an assessment of the degree of toxicological hazard to fish and wildlife, which is influenced by the spatial and temporal variation of the selenium cycle at the site under consideration, The physical area from which measurements are taken to evaluate selenium residues and biological effects, i.e., the database for setting site-specific criteria, must encompass more than an isolated segment of river, a tributary stream, etc. Because of hydrological connections between the various aquatic habitats that may be present in a watershed basin-wetlands, rivers, streams, and impoundments-the toxic threat from selenium contamination is also connected. For example, a criterion that is appropriate for a stream or river where low bioaccumulation occurs may result in seemingly harmless concentrations of selenium becoming a problem in downstream impoundments or in off-channel bays and wetlands where bioaccumulation is greater. The hydrologically connected parts of a basin downstream of a selenium discharge (natural or synthetic selenium source), extending to the point at which new sources of low-selenium water dominate the hydrology (e.g., confluence with larger tributary or river, spring or ground-water inflow), should be the area evaluated and given a specific criterion, not isolated components. Thus, a hydrological unit should be identified and used as the "site" for the purpose of setting criteria. Importantly, criteria derived in such a fashion,will reflect the transport and bioaccumulation of selenium within the entire hydrological unit rather than simply focusing on a small, artificially designated segment of the system. Failure to use a hydrological unit approach can set the stage for significant biological and legal problems. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB The Underwater Radiation Spectral Identification System (URSIS) is a portable spectrometer used for the in sills detection of radioactivity in the marine environment. This paper reports on the first time application of this technology to assess, in a preliminary manner, the potential radiation threat to the public and environment at an aquatic disposal site - the Massachusetts Bay Industrial Waste Site (IWS). Utilizing the meneuvering capabilities of ROV and manned submersible vehicles, the URSIS was successfully positioned close (5-10 cm) to waste containers for a period sufficient to detect, in real time, the presence of radioactive materials. Spectral data from 45 individual targets indicated that the radionuclides present in sediments which draped or partially buried waste containers were consistent with natural background concentrations. No man-made radionuclides were detected at any of the target or background measurement locations. These data support the conclusion that low-level radiation does not pose an imminent and widespread human health or ecological threat in Massachusetts Bay.

AB Toxic blue-green algae present a hazard to human populations that are exposed through drinking water or recreational activities. The toxins include hepatotoxic peptides, a cytotoxic alkaloid, neurotoxic alkaloids, and saxitoxin derivatives, with allergens and lipopolysaccharides also present. The recorded outbreaks of hepatoenteritis through drinking water have occurred in chlorinated supplies at the time of either natural or copper-induced lysis of blue-green algal water blooms, Recent deaths of dialysis patients were from liver injury caused by blue-green algal toxins contaminating a water supply carried by tanker from an algal infested reservoir source. Recreational exposures to water containing toxic blue-green algae have caused illnesses ranging from acute pneumonia and hepatoenteritis to mild skin irritation and gastroenteritis. Water safety guidelines for cyanobacterial toxins are under development by WHO, and a provisional guideline for microcystin-1R of 1 mu g/L has been approved. (C) 1999 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB We reviewed the long-term results of core decompression for the treatment of nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head, performed in thirty-four patients (fifty-four hips) between January 1, 1981, and June 30, 1995. Twenty patients (59 percent) had bilateral involvement. The mean age of the patients at the time of presentation was thirty-eight years (range, twenty-two to eighty-three years). The presumed risk factors were use of corticosteroids (thirty-seven hips), excessive intake of alcohol (eight hips), and use of adrenocorticotropic hormone for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (two hips); the remaining seven hips had idiopathic osteonecrosis.
   According to a modification of the classification system of Ficat and Arlet in combination with the system of Steinberg et al., thirteen hips were stage I (normal radiographs) preoperatively; seven, stage IIA sclerotic; sixteen, stage IIA cystic or sclerocystic; ten, stage IIB (transitional stage, with a crescent sign); and eight, stage III (collapse).
   The mean duration of follow-up after the core decompression was 120 months (range, twenty-four to 196 months). The result was considered successful if the patient was asymptomatic, with no progression of the disease, and unsuccessful if there was radiographic failure (progression to stage III [collapse]) or clinical failure (the need for a subsequent operation), or both.
   The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to estimate clinical and radiographic survival. Overall, twenty-six hips (48 percent) had a satisfactory clinical result and twenty (37 percent) survived according to radiographic criteria. Radiographic or clinical failure, or both, mere seen in four of the thirteen stage-I hips, none of the seven stage-IIA sclerotic hips, thirteen of the sixteen stage-IIA cystic or sclerocystic hips, nine of the ten stage-IIB hips, and all eight stage-III hips.
   On the basis of the Cox proportional-hazards regression model, significant predictors of overall failure included an advanced preoperative radiographic stage (p < 0.0001), a shorter duration of symptoms (p < 0.05), and use of corticosteroids (p < 0.05). No association was found between age, gender, excessive intake of alcohol, or renal transplantation and the overall outcome.
   Two patients (two hips; 4 percent) had a postoperative complication. One patient had a fracture of the femoral neck, and the other had a hematoma.
   Our findings suggest that core decompression is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of stage-I or stage-IIA sclerotic disease. These data also demonstrate the importance of differentiating between stage-IIA sclerotic disease and stage-IIA cystic or sclerocystic disease. We believe that core decompression has a limited role in the operative management of patients who have evidence of cystic changes in the femoral head on plain radiographs.

ID ARTERY STENOSIS; FOLLOW-UP; DISEASE
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of the progression of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
   Methods: In a 10-year period, 1701 carotid arteries in 1004 patients who were asymptomatic were studied with serial duplex scans (mean follow-up period, 28 months; mean number of scans, 2.9/patient). At each visit, stenoses of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the external carotid artery (ECA) were categorized as none (0 to 14%), mild (15% to 49%), moderate (50% to 79%), severe (80% to 99%), preocclusive, or occluded. Progression was defined as an increase in ICA stenosis to greater than or equal to 50% for carotid arteries with a baseline of <50% or as an increase to a higher category of stenosis if the baseline stenosis was greater than or equal to 50%. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for data analysis.
   Results: The risk of progression of ICA stenosis increased steadily with time (annualized risk of progression, 9.3%). With multivariate modeling, the four most important variables that affected the progression (P < .02) were baseline ipsilateral ICA stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (relative risk [RR], 3.34), baseline ipsilateral ECA stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (RR, 1.51), baseline contralateral ICA stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (RR, 1.41), and systolic pressure more than 160 mm Hg (RR, 1.37). Ipsilateral neurologic ischemic events (stroke/transient ischemic attack) occurred in association with 14.0% of the carotid arteries that were studied. The progression of ICA stenosis correlated with these events (P < .001), but baseline ICA stenosis was not a significant predictor.
   Conclusion: In contrast to recently published studies, we found that the risk of progression of carotid stenosis is substantial and increases steadily with time. Baseline TCA stenosis was the most important predictor of the progression, but baseline ECA stenosis also was identified as an important independent predictor. Contralateral ICA stenosis and systolic hypertension were additional significant predictors. We found further that the progression of ICA stenosis correlated with ischemic neurologic events but not baseline stenosis. The data provide justification for the use of serial duplex scans to follow carotid stenosis and suggest that different follow-up intervals may be appropriate for different patient subgroups.

AB Objectives This study attempted to determine the prognostic indicators of low-back pain in an occupational health setting.
   Methods The identification of prognostic factors of (i) functional disability after 3 months' follow-up, (ii) functional disability after 12 months' follow-up, and (iii) time to return to work among 120 workers who reported to an occupational health unit and were off work with low-back pain for at least 10 days. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated for the 3 outcome measures.
   Results Factors related to a longer time to return to work were radiating pain, high functional disability at the beginning of the study, problems in relations with colleagues, and high work tempo and work quantity. High functional disability at the beginning of the study and a high avoidance coping style predicted functional disability at 3 months. Functional disability at 12 months was more accurately predicted by work-related and psychosocial factors.
   Conclusions Especially radiating pain and functional disability predict a long duration of low-back pain in occupational health practice. Occupational physicians should also note work-related and psychosocial characteristics.

ID LONG-TERM SURVIVAL; CARDIAC-SURGERY; EXPERIENCE; SYSTEM
AB Background: Long-term analyses after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to investigate therapeutical options and factors influencing the natural course of ischemic heart disease. In general, long-term studies require a followup. Dependent on the interval between the intervention and the follow-up procedure a certain amount of patients is lost to follow-up. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of incomplete follow-up on conclusions regarding the postoperative patient outcome. For the investigation, the same statistical methods were applied to the data accumulated by the 70% and by the 90% responses. Methods: 2012 patients underwent isolated CABG; between June 1988 and December 1992. For data acquisition, tools of the HVMD (Heidelberger Verein fur multizentrische Datenanalyse e.V.) were used. Analyses were performed using tools of SAS (Statistical Analysis Systems, Inc.). The parametric, time-adjusted hazard function method was employed. A first follow-up questionnaire, was distributed six months after operation with a 97.8% response. In February 1997 the same questionnaire was sent to patients and their general practioners. The primary response to that was 68.9% (similar to 70%). Then another mailing of the same questionnaire and phone calls to patients and their home doctors raised the response to 93.7% (similar to 90%). Results: The mean follow-up was 1378 days in the group with 70% response and 1682 days in the group with 90% response. The parametric, time-adjusted hazard function showed a very similar pattern of factors in the early phase of both groups. In the 90% response group, the intermediate phase reached a higher relative influence than in the 70% response group. The relative influence of the late phase showed an inverse pattern. In the multivariate analysis most of the variables which had been identified by the 70% response model reappeared in the 90% response model. However, there were some potentially important and interesting differences. Conclusions: The results indicate the necessity to carefully consider the acceptance of incomplete follow-up for differentiated risk adjustment.

AB The United States Environmental Protection Agency routinely use the sub-tropical mysid Americamysis (= Mysidopsis) bahia (Peracarida: Mysidacea) in laboratory testing to measure the toxicity of contaminants and to assess the potential hazards of toxic chemicals to the natural aquatic environment. The use of A. bahia in laboratory toxicity testing has extended to Europe, however, there is increasing interest in using indigenous species for predicting toxicity hazards to European waters. Neomysis integer (Leach) is the most common member of the hyperbenthic fauna of Western European estuaries and has been proposed as an alternative to the standard American species (A, bahia) for toxicity testing. Adult N. integer were exposed to chlorpyrifos and dimethoate (both widely used organophosphate pesticides) in flow-through and semi-static acute toxicity tests. Neomysis integer was more sensitive to chlorpyrifos (96 h LC50 of 0.13 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)) than dimethoate (96 h LC50 of 540 mu g dimethoate l(-1)). Juvenile N, integer, collected within 24 h of release from ovigerous females, were equally tolerant to chlorpyrifos as adult mysids (96 h LC50 of 0.19 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)). Gas chromatographic analysis of chlorpyrifos in the water samples revealed that considerable degradation or loss (> 50%) occurred within 24 h in the semi-static exposure vessels, highlighting the advantages of flow-through testing facilities. Although the 96 h LC50 for chlorpyrifos was higher for N, integer than for A. bahia (e.g. 0.035 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)), it was comparable with those of other frequently-used test species (0.1-6.0 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)). The results support the use of N. integer as an alternative to A. bahia for the testing of toxicants and the evaluation of toxic contamination events in European estuaries.

AB Background-Surgical correction of mitral regurgitation in patients with no or mild symptoms remains controversial, particularly because the impact of preoperative symptoms on postoperative outcome is unknown.
   Methods and Results-The long-term outcome of 478 patients with organic mitral regurgitation (199 in NYHA functional class I/II and 279 in class III/IV before surgery) operated on between 1984 and 1991 was analyzed. In patients in NYHA class VII before surgery compared with those in class III/IV, postoperative long-term survival was higher (at 10 years, 76+/-5% versus 48+/-4%, P<0.0001), with lower operative mortality (0.5% versus 5.4%, P=0.003) and better late survival (P<0.0001). Comparison of observed and expected survival showed identical curves in patients in class I/II before surgery (P=0.18), whereas excess mortality was observed in patients in class IIV/V before surgery (P<0.0001). Excess mortality associated with severe symptoms was also confirmed in all subgroups (all P<0.003) and in multivariate analysis (P=0.0036; adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.81 [1.21 to 2.70]).
   Conclusions-In patients with organic mitral regurgitation, preoperative functional class III/IV symptoms are associated with excess short- and long-term postoperative mortality independently of all baseline characteristics. These data should lead to consideration of surgical correction of severe organic mitral regurgitation when no or minimal symptoms are present in patients at low operative risk, especially if repair is feasible.

AB Conflicting data exist on the prognosis of hereditary colorectal cancer. HNPCC patients, in particular, are often reported to have a better survival. We examined 2,340 colorectal-cancer patients treated in our Institution: 144 HNPCC patients (Amsterdam Criteria), 161 FAP patients and 2,035 patients with sporadic cancer. Data on hereditary-cancer patients treated between 1980 and 1995 was collected in a registry. The 2,035 sporadic colorectal-cancer patients (controls) included all new cases treated in the Department of Gastrointestinal-Tract Surgery during the same period. Observed survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative survival probability was estimated at 5 years within each group and stratified by various clinical and pathological variables. The age distribution at diagnosis of sporadic patients was significantly higher than that of FAP and HNPCC patients (median 60 years vs. 43 and 49 years; p < 0.0001). In the HNPCC group, 40% had a right cancer location, vs. 14% in the FAP group and 13% in the sporadic-cancer group. In the sporadic group, 51% were early-stage cancers (Dukes A or B) vs. 48.4% and 52.1% in the FAP and HNPCC groups respectively. In the HNPCC, FAP and sporadic-cancer groups, the 5-year cumulative survival rate was 56.9%, 54.4% and 50.6% respectively. Survival analysis by the Cox proportional-hazards method revealed no substantial survival advantage for HNPCC and FAP patients compared with the sporadic group, after adjustment for age, gender, stage and tumor location. The hazard ratio for HNPCC was 1.01 (95% CI 0.72-1.39) and 1.27 (95% CI 0.95-1.7) for FAP patients compared with the sporadic-colorectal-cancer group. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   CURABILITY
AB Background: The longest interval between primary treatment of breast cancer and tumor recurrence, i.e., the limit of breast cancer dormancy, defines the appropriate length of follow-up, the effectiveness of treatment, and curability (no excess mortality risk for patients relative to the general population) for the disease. To determine this limit, we analyzed long-term follow-up data from patients who underwent a radical mastectomy during a four-decade period at the University of Chicago Hospitals. Methods: For 1547 patients operated on during the period from 1945 through mid-1987, the number of recurrences and deaths occurring within each postoperative year were tabulated, and the hazard rate for first recurrence or death from breast cancer was estimated by use of the actuarial method. The excess mortality rate was calculated for successive 5-year intervals, beginning at the time of mastectomy, by use of U.S. life tables and matching on the basis of age, race, and sex. Results: Most recurrences occurred within the first 10 years after mastectomy, Recurrences were rare after 20 years; only one recurrence was reported among 192 patients followed for 26-45 years. Patients who had a recurrence within 5 years following mastectomy had shorter subsequent survival times than those whose recurrence appeared after 5 years (two-sided P = .0001), The excess death rate increased with pathologic stage of the primary tumor, Overall, there was evidence of excess mortality up to 20 years postsurgery (two-sided P = .009), Conclusions: The limit of breast cancer dormancy in this patient population appears to be between 20 and 25 years. After this time, recurrences were rare, and the mortality rate was no longer statistically significantly different from that of the general population, Patients surviving to this time without evidence of recurrence or contralateral breast cancer are probably cured.

AB Aging is an inexorable and unceasing natural phenomenon. Everything ages. The aging of living creatures is obvious, but even the very rocks of the earth are aged by the rains of the millennia. This paper deals with aging in electronic systems and emphasizes the identification of system components that may be reaching end-of-life. This paper is the result of years of study of the records of hundreds of installations of electronic control systems in service for some twenty to twenty-five years. This paper is also the result of personal observations on more than twenty Reliability Site Surveys on electronic systems installed in many different areas of the world.
   As we approach the end of the century and of the millennium, there are many electronic systems nearing the wearout portion of the classical hazard curve. The United States Navy is concerned with the amount of life remaining in the systems in its nuclear submarine fleet. The United States Air Force is similarly concerned with the amount of life remaining in its B52 Bombers. The Air Force has refurbished B52 Bombers by replacing their wings and by upgrading old vacuum tube control systems to state of the art digital electronics.([1]) Similarly, the Federal Aviation Administration has had difficulties with its aging Air Traffic Control, (ATC), system. In 1995, when the ATC computers "... failed at Washington's National Airport, technicians could only find the part in Poland".([2]) The necessary replacement part was an archaic vacuum tube.
   In the process industries, many electronic control systems are reaching twenty-five years of fruitful service: their silver anniversary. The process industries convert raw materials into finished product. Refineries that crack crude oil into gasoline, mills that convert wood pulp into paper and plants that cook tomatoes into ketchup are excellent examples of the variety of operations in the process industries. In the process industries, electronic control systems are also exhibiting the warning signs of wearout, but incidents at process control plants are not dramatically reported in daily newspapers.
   Aging and wearout are timely topics for today's economy. Worldwide financial conditions have forced process plant managers to use electronic control systems long beyond their design life. Process industry management has had a reputation for frugality. When capital investments are considered, it is usually easier to make do with existing equipment than to defend the expenditure of capital on new equipment. This fiscal conservatism has presented me with the opportunity to survey electronic control systems in more than 20 process plants, ranging from chemical plants in South Africa, to refineries in Texas and to power plants in Saskatchewan. This paper records the findings of those surveys, adds to the body of literature on aging and wearout in electronics, and makes engineering generalizations that can be applied to similar kinds of systems, such as your personal computer. A review of two decades of the Proceedings of the Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposia found only four papers dealing with the key word, "wearout', and none of the four deal with wearout in electronic systems.([3 to 6])

TI The shallow ground water chemistry of arsenic, fluorine, and major

SO APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID QUATERNARY SALINE LAKES; TRANSPORT; BASIN; PH
AB Owens Lake in SE California became essentially dry by the 1920s after the Los Angeles Aqueduct was constructed and diversion of water from the Owens River began. Frequent dust storms at Owens Lake produce clouds of efflorescent salts which present human health hazards as a result of their small particle size and elevated concentrations of As and SO4. This study was conducted to characterize the evolution of major elements in ground water in eastern Owens Lake and to examine the factors controlling the concentrations of dissolved As and F. Evapoconcentration of shallow ground waters at the lakebed surface produces high pH, high alkalinity brines with major ion compositions that are consistent with those predicted by the Hardie-Eugster Model. Evaporite minerals identified in the surface salts using XRD were halite (NaCl), thenardite (Na2SO4), trona (Na3H(CO3)(2). 2H(2)O), pirssonite (Na2Ca(CO3)(2). 2H(2)O), and nesquehonite (MgCO3. 3H(2)O). Significant correlations between both As and F with Li in shallow ground waters indicate that As and F are not partitioned into surface salts until very high salinities are reached (> 9.0 m). Leaching experiments show that As and F can be readily released from lakebed salts when exposed to natural precipitation. Conservative behavior of As and F results from the high pH values and low Ca activities of shallow ground waters that contribute to: (1) redox stability of As(V) even at moderately reducing conditions, (2) a decrease in the adsorption affinities of As and F to mineral surfaces, (3) undersaturation with respect to fluorite (CaF2(s)).

AB This study evaluates prognostic factors that may influence survival in patients who present with carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer. Patients may present with carcinomatosis as the pattern of metastases at the initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Little is known about the natural history of carcinomatosis and the prognostic factors affecting outcome. All patients treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1988 to 1994 who presented with carcinomatosis at the initial diagnosis of colorectal cancer were identified A retrospective review of the medical records for patient and tumor demographics was performed. Estimated survival distributions were calculated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. Tests of significance with respect to survival distribution were based on the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis. There were 31 males and 38 females. The median-age was 61 years (range, 26-80). The primary cancers were in the sigmoid with 24 patients (35%), cecum with 14 patients (20%), and transverse colon with II patients (16%). The remainder were distributed throughout the colon and rectum. The most common presentation was large bowel obstruction in 29 patients (42%). T3 and T4 cancers were present in 39 (57%) and 13 patients (19%), respectively. Lymph nodes were positive in 39 patients (57%), and mucin-producing tumors were also present in 39 patients (57%). Twelve patients (17%) had one site of disease, 17 patients (25%) had two sites of disease, and 37 (54%) patients had three or more sites of disease. Ascites was present in 29 patients (42%). Residual disease was present at the completion of surgery in 45 patients, absent in 13 patients, and status unknown in 11. The presence of residual disease (p = 0.0001), presence of ascites (p = 0.02), stage greater than T3 (p = 0.02), and increasing number of carcinomatosis sites (p = 0.006) were found to have a negative impact on survival on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, only the presence of residual disease at the completion of surgery was found to be an independent predictor of survival (p = 0.04). Overall median survival was 14 months with a 26% estimated 2-year survival. The presence of gross residual disease at the completion of surgery was shown to be the only independent factor negatively affecting survival. This has potential implications for the operative management of patients presenting with colorectal carcinomatosis.

DT Article
DE natural durability; EN 350-1; lesser-known wood species
AB Under laboratory conditions basidiomycete and soft rot tests were carried out on more than 20 hardwood species and 3 softwood species together with reference species to evaluate their natural durability according to the European standard EN 350 part 1. The basidiomycetes tests were carried out using Gloeophyllum trabeum Coniophora puteana, Poria placenta and Coriolus versicolor all fungal strains in malt agar tests and in agreement with the EN 113. Such tests did not provide a solid basis to classify all wood species according to known durability classes (EN 350, part 2). There was only a distinct differentiation noted between those species belonging to the group with a durability classified 1 to 3 and those classified 4 to 5. Conclusively, only Limited additional information on durability of tropical hardwoods was gained from brown rot tests. Despite both types of laboratory tests on soft rot, prescribed in ENV 807 (vermiculite and soil) which show the essential differences to the basidiomycete test results, it has not been possible to classify the durability subdivisions in a more substantial way. Adding to these tests the durability classification, based upon a field stake test (EN 252) and a greenhouse accelerated stake test, was also carried out. Using this last method, results can be gathered more rapidly and consequently confirm the efficiency of lab tests. Generally it is perceived that lab tests and accelerated tests are important tools in the prediction of the natural durability of wood. To further improve the predictability value, durability testing would be enhanced when using a hazard class orientation. Therefore the function of the conclusive end product can be identified in a more obvious way.

TI Tee politics of "natural" disaster: Who made Mitch so bad?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
AB The devastation in Central America following the 1998 hurricane (Hurricane Mitch) resulted more from economic and political policies than from "natural" disaster. Over the last 30 or 40 years, huge numbers of poor people in these countries have been forced off good, stable agricultural land onto degraded hillsides and into shanty towns constructed on floodplains Yeas known to pose serious hazards of flooding and mudslides. This, together with the failure of impoverished countries to anticipate disaster through mass evacuations or to respond effectively to the hurricane's widespread damage-ensured the loss of thousands of lives.

AB Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material, natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm densities (+76% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass (+13%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13%. The percentage of insect infested shoots was 8.8% of the total shoot population compared with 20.1% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment had stopped the reed stands showed an 'overshoot' biomass production, and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and benefits.

AB 1. The intra-patch experience acquired by foraging parasitoid females has often been considered to have a strong influence on their tendency to leave a patch, and thus on their total patch residence time. Most studies that have been performed on this subject suggest that the patch-leaving rules observed are adaptive because they enable the females to adjust their patch residence time to local environmental conditions.
   2. Considering a behavioural rule as being adaptive supposes that it has been progressively settled by natural selection, and thus that there is, in the population, genetic variation on which the natural selection could act.
   3. Therefore, this study aimed to discover whether there was indeed genetic variability in the patch-leaving decision rules in a population of the egg parasitoid species Telenomus busseolae, which attacks patches of its hosts, the eggs of Sesamia nonagrioides, Different wasp families were compared using the isofemale lines method, and the behavioural records were analysed by means of a modified version of the Cox's proportional hazards model proposed by Haccou et al. (1991) and Hemerik, Driessen & Haccou (1993).
   4. The results obtained show that T. busseolae females increase their tendency to leave the patch after each successful oviposition. Each host rejection also led to an increase in the tendency to leave the patch, but this effect was smaller when host rejections were observed between two ovipositions occurring in rapid succession. Subsequent visits to the patch also increased the patch-leaving tendency.
   5. Genetic variability was found in both the global patch-leaving tendency and in the effect that successful ovipositions and host rejections have on this tendency.
   6. The adaptive and evolutionary consequences of these results are discussed.

AB Methamphetamine (MAP) is currently considered to be the major illicit drug in Taiwan, and MAP constitutes the majority of illicit drugs seized by the judicial institutes. Thus, MAP has raised public attention. The purpose of this retrospective study is to observe the trends of MAP-related fatalities in Taiwan with respect to the manners of death so as to determine the epidemiological implications of MAP. Two hundred and ferry-four MAP-related fatalities out of a total of 3958 forensic fatalities were collected by the Forensic Medicine Center (Taiwan) during the period of 1991 to 1996. The annual percentages of MAP-related fatalities compared to the total autopsy cases during 1991 through 1996 were 3.4, 10.3, 12.1, 4.2, 4.0 and 5.6%, showing that the number of MAP-related fatalities increased from 1991 to 1993, declined during 1991 and 1995, and rose again in 1995. The mean age of the MAP-related fatalities during this period was 30.7 years and occurred predominantly in males (73%). The manner of deaths included natural, accidental, suicidal, homicidal and uncertain causes of deaths, represented, respectively, by 31 (13%), 143 (59%), 28 (11%), 34 (14% and 8 (3%) cases. As a consequence of the endemic problem and public hazard created by illicit drug abuse in Taiwan, stronger anti-drug programs and curbs to illicit-drug addiction were required urgently from the government and from the public. The findings of this study represent the results of utilization of an anti-drug program in Taiwan (Support by NSC 85-2331-B-016-092).

AB At least 10 different genetic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes (A-J) are responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Much of the understanding of HIV-1 disease progression derives from studies in the developed world where HIV infection is almost exclusively subtype B. This has led many to question whether the properties and consequences of HIV-1 infection can be generalized across subtypes that afflict the majority of infected persons in the developing world. From 1985 to 1997, a prospective study of registered female sex workers in Senegal tracked the introduction and spread of HIV-1 subtypes A, C, D, and G, In clinical follow-up, the AIDS-free survival curves differed by HIV-1 subtype. Women infected with a non-A subtype were 8 times more likely to develop AIDS than were those infected with subtype A (hazard ratio = 8.23; P = .009), the predominant subtype in the study. These data suggest that HIV-1 subtypes may differ in rates of progression to AIDS.

AB Most of the adverse impacts on man and/or the environment result from routine human activities such as the process industry, electricity generation and use, transport and agriculture (hazards, i.e. sources of risk). Apart from such essentially technological hazards, possibly resulting in "accidents", human health and the environment can also be affected by natural hazards, possibly resulting in "disasters", such as earthquakes or floods. This paper examines current trends in the risk sources and occurrences of four classes of such types of undesired events, entailing largely involuntary risk (e.g. neither car-driving nor smoking):
   major accidents at fixed installations in the process industry,
   incidents/accidents at nuclear installations,
   marine transport and offshore installation accidents,
   disasters caused by natural hazards and their potential exacerbation by human activities.
   It aims to provide an integrated overview of such events in Europe ( equivalent to 15 EU Member States, 4 EFTA, 13 PHARE, 7 TACIS and 5 other South and South Eastern European countries) during the last decade, estimating and interpreting trends in the number of risk sources and accidental events. For each type of event, specific "accident" definitions are given, illustrating the differences in the perception of the respective risk. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE onshore pipelines; major hazards; failure causes/consequences
AB Failures of pipelines conveying dangerous substances can pose major risks. Identification of pipeline hazards associated with the different pipeline system functions is essential for risk analysis and historical data are of great importance. Incident data are analysed, following a review of official sources, by failure mechanism, size and function of the systems in two types of transmission networks around the world, i.e. natural gas and hazardous liquids. The development of the networks and the reporting criteria used by the official sources for the collection of incidents in the last twenty five years have shown remarkable differences. The performance of both gas and liquid transmission lines in Europe, the US and the former Soviet Union in terms of failures has shown a progressive improvement but the extent of consequences following gas releases and oil spillages have not shown any change in the last fifteen years. External interference is not always the predominant cause of failures in all systems depending also on pipe size. Failures with casualties in gas transmission have not shown any decrease over the last decade and there is a clear indication that many are connected with the parts and functions other than the main body of the pipeline. A comparison between European and US gas frequency data, derived under common constraints, shows that valuable information can be lost when criteria for incidents collection are only limited to the body of the pipeline.

ID EXPLAINED VARIATION; SURVIVAL-DATA; REGRESSION
AB A measure of dependence for survival data was presented by Kent and O'Quigley (1988). The purpose of this present work is to show that an alternative, although less immediate specification of the problem, leads to great simplification and generality. This alternative specification is in fact more natural in the context of the semi-parametric proportional hazards regression. One consequence of this is that the alternative specification can immediately accommodate time dependent covariates, a natural feature of the proportional hazards model and one that the Kent and O'Quigley specification was unable to deal with. This measure is invariant to monotonically increasing transformations on the time scale, such invariance being considered fundamental in the case of the regression coefficient beta. Computational aspects involve only those quantities routinely calculated in a proportional hazards analysis. In practice our impressions are that the two measures will generally be close. A disadvantage of the alternative specification over the original Kent and O'Quigley one occurs with discrete covariates having few levels where the upper bound of the measure can be less than one. Nonetheless, for the ranges of values considered in the Kent and O'Quigley work, the two measures show good agreement. The new measure can be adapted to general forms of relative risk for survival models.

AB For effective planning and execution of conservation programs that sustain productivity, an attempt has been made to delineate India into 17 Sail Conservation Regions (SCRs). To demarcate the SCRs attributes of-roil (depth, texture, slope and erosion hazards) have been integrated on it land capability classification map, over which were superimposed the maps of annual rainfall daily rainfall Erosion Index, and land we. SCR boundaries were further refined by superimposing a map of agroecological regions, which has a bias for maximizing plant production. The area for each SCR was finalized by wing ii catchment region map of the country to ensure that SCR boundaries align with the boundaries of the nearest natural watershed, sub-catchment, catchment basin, or water resource region. Further delineation of SCRs into Soil Conservation Areas (SCAs) as the principal management unit, and micro-watershed areas called Soil Conservation Units (SCUs) also is discussed Each SCU is about 1,500 to 2,000 ha (3,750 to 5,000 ac) in size an a scale of 1:50,000. Delineation of SCRs into SCRs and SCUs is based an predominant land use, production potential crop evapotranspiration (ET) requirements, scope for development of water resources, prevailing erosion rates and conservation problems, population-supporting capacities, and technological innovations in a given area. Planning at the SCU level ultimately will pave the way for the creation of a nationwide Soil Conservation Service that can help maximize sustainable production.

TI Orbit and pointing design of remote sensing satellites for natural

ID SYSTEM
AB Several authors have pointed out the need for fast and accurate mapping of areas hit by natural disasters. This task cannot be adequately carried out by existing high-resolution spaceborne remote sensing systems, due to their limitations in repeat frequency. Consequently, new missions based on advanced and pointable sensors must be considered. To this end, this paper introduces and analyzes various space missions aimed at frequent coverage of mid-latitude regions. After a description of the key design issues involved in orbit and pointing selection for high temporal, geometric and radiometric resolution remote sensing missions, two orbits are selected (Sun-synchronous and 51 degrees inclination) by means of an iterative procedure which accounts for required repetitivity and sensor swath. Off-nadir pointable, active microwave and passive electro-optical systems are simulated, using the Mediterranean area as test site. Quantitative results show the advantages connected to the use of active sensors, thanks to their capability to operate without solar illumination restrictions, and of the prograde orbits, provided that the mission covers the range of latitudes of interest. But, an adequate orbit and pointing design makes also possible electro-optical missions. with satisfactory performance. In particular, stereopairs obtained by along- and across-track optical coverage are considered for their usefulness in topographic applications. Finally, constellations of pointable satellites are simulated.

AB An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a monoclonal antibody was used to determine microcystin (MC) concentrations in water supplies and water plant samples collected between November 1995 and October 1996, from five regions of Parana, Brazil. In addition, the presence of Microcystis sp, was monitored. Of the 50 samples obtained, 12 were from an urban lake, 8 from human water supplies, 10 from recreational lakes, 13 from farm waters used for animal pasture and 7 from aquaculture facilities. M, aeruginosa was positive in all locations. MCs were positive (>50 pg ml(-1)) in 9 samples (2 samples from human water supplies, 5 from recreational lakes and 2 from animal pasture). Heavy contamination with MCs was observed in water samples collected in May 1996 from 2 recreation (swimming-fishing sites at Itaipu dam, 6380 and 10 000 pg ml(-1)) and human supplies (6627 pg ml(-1)) samples. At these sites, a large bloom of Microcystis sp, was detected. Treatment with 1 ppm Cl- reduced MCs levels, although 267 pg ml(-1) remained in the water plant samples. Our data showed frequent occurrence of Microcystis sp., which may be a hazard to humans and animals in the state of Parana. More detailed investigations are required to evaluate the risk of natural MC contamination in the water supplied in this region. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Ecosystem and legal framework for coastal management in central Chile
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB At ecosystem level, sandy beaches, dune fields, cliffs, and marine terraces are the main physiographic units which characterize the coastal fringe of central Chile. Natural hazards - storm surges, tsunamis, and heavy rains - may induce risks of flooding, erosion, mudflow, and mass movement for human settlements. Land use, in particular related to the recent tourist boom, as well as induced environmental degradation are reviewed. The legal framework for seaside human occupation is critically examined. Recommendations for a better development are proposed only. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Coastal hazards and associated management issues on South Pacific
   Islands
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EL-NINO; GROWTH
AB An understanding of natural coastal hazards is essential for the safe and sustainable development of the small island states in the South Pacific. This paper describes the roles of coastal geology and oceanography in the analysis of impacts due to fluctuating water levels and wave damage from cyclones. The examples include coastal erosion, flooding and wave damage in a range of island settings. As seen in Tarawa, rapid erosion and accretion can result from both short-lived storms as well as transient sub-decadal water-level changes related to El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Cyclone waves are responsible for extensive damage in low-lying atolls and on the coastal fringes of high islands. Observed cyclone wave impacts in Niue demonstrate that even infrastructure perched on 20 m cliffs may not be immune during severe storms. These examples demonstrate that integrated coastal management (ICM) plans, to be successful, must explicitly incorporate a realistic range of coastal processes and responses based on an understanding of the physical environment. It should be noted that much ICM begins with institutional and policy issues and incorporates science as a secondary component. When science is introduced, much emphasis is placed on biological issues and on infrastructure development, while non-living resources and physical shore processes are sometimes overlook. As we hope the examples in this paper demonstrate, the geological oceanographic context may be absolutely fundamental to the recognition of hazards, delineation of risk, and prediction of changes that may occur from any manipulation in the coastal system.

TI Plastics and South Pacific Island shores: environmental implications
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article

   impact; solutions
ID MARINE POLLUTION; COASTAL ZONE; NEW-ZEALAND; DEBRIS; SCRUBBERS; BEACHES
AB Studies from South Pacific Islands, some of which are uninhabited, as well as eastern Australia and New Zealand, show that discarded plastics are a significant pollutant of shorelines and adjacent coastal and oceanic waters. Environmental impacts include: death and/or debilitation of wildlife through entanglement and ingestion, reductions in quality of life and reproductive performance, hazards to shipping and possibly health, and a vector for the introduction of alien taxa that may endanger island ecosystems or traditional seafood resources. This material is also aesthetically distasteful.
   Blame for this pollution has been placed largely on indiscriminate disposal of plastic by vessels at sea. However, there is a growing appreciation that much shoreline litter has urban sources reflecting inadequate disposal practices as well as recreational visitors. Increasing population pressures and shipping activities around the region will lead to ever-growing quantities of unsightly plastic litter on shorelines of the region and experience elsewhere suggests this could be to the detriment of tourism.
   The problems need to be addressed through the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region with common regional management policies developed similar to those now in place for the Caribbean. These should focus on waste disposal practices and identification of sites suitable for land-fill operations as well as development of port reception facilities. Alleviation of the problems may also come from Annex V of MARPOL and the London Dumping Convention, but ultimately the solutions will have to be regional in character and involve education sensitive to local cultures.

TI Utilization of geoindicators for rapid assessment of coastal-hazard risk
   and mitigation
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID SHORELINE CHANGE; PUERTO-RICO; FLORIDA; DAMAGE
AB Geoindicators provide a management tool for rapid assessment of natural hazard risk potential, either as a supplement to long-term environmental auditing and monitoring, or for initial coastal assessment as in developing countries. Using examples of barrier island and bluffed coasts, indicators of process/response are examined regionally, locally, and site-specifically; the latter being the primary indicators of property-threatening hazards. Tabled evaluation parameters range from general (elevation and vegetation) to specific characteristics such as shoreline stability and configuration, inlet proximity, and barrier-island interior geomorphology. Geoindicators also provide guidance for local mitigation of hazard impacts. A case study of Bogue Banks, North Carolina, shows that the geoindicators approach is applicable to communities with extant management plans. Bogue Banks' five communities must reevaluate mitigation strategies after every storm and because of changes induced through development. By applying the geoindicators approach, shoreline reaches as well as interior areas may be reassigned as to the level of risk, and appropriate mitigation actions taken. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO PACIFIC REVIEW

AB Historians have generally been reticent in attributing any special role to natural disasters in shaping the evolution of human societies, yet there is a fundamental relationship between the history and structure of societies and its vulnerability to these events. This paper explores the relationship between environment and poverty in one such society particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, the Philippines. It argues that the extremes of wealth and power characteristic of this society are possibly the result of the frequency and magnitude of such events that exacerbate social inequalities. Specifically, the paper examines the rising incidence of natural disasters in recent decades, both globally and within the Philippines, and then assesses the effectiveness of the relief mechanisms that the latter has evolved to cope with these occurrences. Finally, the paper investigates the correlation between natural disasters and the way power and wealth are articulated in the Philippines.

AB The Miage Glacier is the biggest in the Italian side of the Mont Blanc and is located a few km west of Courmayeur. The Miage lake is a typical periglacial lake that is found on the right hydrographical side of the glacier. The glacier high dynamics produces frequent falls of huge ice blocks into the lake representing an important tourist draw. On August 9, 1996, after a long period of heavy rain, a big ice block, with estimated volume in the range 7,000-16,000 cubic meters, fell into the lake provoking an anomalous water wave that involved many tourists, causing some persons to be seriously wounded.
   The main goal of this work is to stress that for alpine glaciers a correct policy of natural hazard mitigation must be founded both on a good scientific understanding of the glacier dynamics and on rigorous measures of prevention, that in case of conflict must have anyhow priorities on touristic activities.

TI The development of compound lava fields at Mount Etna
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART A-SOLID EARTH AND GEODESY
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOWS
AB The formation of compound lava fields is a common feature of basaltic volcanic areas such as Mount Etna and Hawaii. It is generally promoted by a break-in-slope which results into a decrease of the mean flow velocity and the rapid adjustment to new rheological conditions. In fact, on a steep slope the flow is generally focused into long-lived lava tubes or channels. On the contrary, in correspondence of a flat ground the propagation of a lava field is guaranteed by the continuos opening of new ephemeral vents, and by the overlapping of lava lobes or tongues the length of which is order of 10(-1)-10(2) m. At Mount Etna these flow units show a complex structure which reflects the existence of a central plug zone and lateral shear zones, and an internal structure characterized by a succession of lava layers separated by gas-rich layers which occur in correspondence of vesicle alignments. Such internal structure insulates the active moving core and preserves high lava temperatures, favoring the advancement of the flow units. The evolution of a compound lava field may be thus envisaged as a spatial and temporal succession of lava tubes. An example of this situation may be found in the 1983 and 1991-93 Etnean eruptions, where. the propagation of long-lived compound lava fields through a great number of small subarterial flow units gave origin to a source of natural hazards for some of the communities living on the flanks of the volcano. The detailed study of the structure of the described lava flows helps understand their emplacement dynamics and evaluate the associated volcanic hazard. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Influence of sulphur mustard (SM), a chemical warfare agent, and its oxygen analogue (OA), on surface relief features, mechanical properties and protection afforded by elastomeric membranes was investigated. The objective of the study was to assess the SM induced deterioration in the performance of the protective barrier against chemical hazard. Strain at break increases after exposure to SM in the elastomers studied, possibly due to plasticization. SM also induces microcracks in nitrile rubber (NBR) and natural rubber (PI) besides causing leaching of the compounding ingredients in the latter. This results in lowering of breakthrough time (BTT) of the permeant SM and hence a drop in the protection afforded by the elastomer membrane. Decontamination of the membrane using bleaching powder and boiling water for two hours helps in approaching the initial BTT value. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Potential explosion hazards arising from releases of natural gas are now reasonably well understood, but the hazards exhidited by two-phase liquid-vapour mixtures are often overlooked. A number of explosions believed to be two-phase in nature have occurred within the process industries, so emphasizing the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms which contribute to aerosol explosions. It has been predicted that an aerosol containing droplets within the so-called 'transition' range, typically between 7-15 mu m, may burn faster than an optimally mixed homogeneous vapour/air mixture. Other models predict that the burning velocity attained for a gaseous mixture is the maximum attainable. A few experimental publications discuss the generation and combustion of fuel aerosols, but have failed to examine the area of most interest. This paper reviews previous theoretical; experimental and computational approaches relating aerosol explosions, and presents a research strategy suitable for progression towards robust quantification of this category of explosion.

ID SOLID-WASTE MANAGEMENT; DAR-ES-SALAAM
AB Municipal solid waste disposal has become an ever-increasing problem in Tanzanian towns, partly due the prevailing rapid urbanisation process. As a solution to the crisis, the government intends to construct and operate sanitary landfills for disposing of heterogeneous solid wastes, in five municipalities of Arusha, Moshi, Tanga, Morogoro and Iringa. The project is to be financed by external donors and already preliminary investigations and design works have been completed. Historically, solid wastes have been crudely disposed of in natural depressions or abandoned quarry sites in all urban centers in Tanzania. However, this practice has resulted into a range of environmental and public health problems. The sanitary landfills technology is new in the country and is expected to provide solutions to some of the existing problems. On the other hand if the system will be mismanaged, which is likely judging from the existing trends, far reaching environmental implications could result. As part of the lending requirements from the financiers, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study of the project was conducted from March-June 1996 to investigate in depth its environmental sensitivity. The potential adverse environmental impacts found include resettlement of families and complications in land acquisition, production of leachate which may contaminate the groundwater and public health hazards and offensive odour production should the system become inefficient (waste case scenario). However, long term benefits of safer and cleaner environment, employment opportunities and reduction of waste related diseases characterise the project. This paper presents the key features of the EIA study on the project elements and discusses the important mitigation measures to be applied using the case of Tanga municipality. The paper also discusses some of the constraints to EIA process in Tanzania. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Meteor storms are of concern to satellite operators because they are a natural impact hazard. Little is known about their cause and effect. Meteor storms are rare and have never been studied by modern techniques. Now, the upcoming Leonid returns of November '98 and '99 offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to gather data that can help assess the impact hazard of meteor storms and provide a wealth of data on the physics and chemistry of meteoroids accreting into the Earth's atmosphere. Three months before the Nov. '98 return, we here give gn update of what to expect and what observing efforts are going to be made. (C) 1999 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The geostationary orbit is a unique natural resource that mankind will find useful for many generations to come. During a little over than 30 years, more than 600 objects have been placed into this region. Most of these objects were left in stable orbits to remain there for many thousands of years. At least three of these objects experienced fragmentation, whose fragments are too small to be detected from the earth, but are large enough to damage or destroy other satellites. The motion of these objects was analyzed to find out potential collision hazards including longitudinal clustering and sun-moon gravity effects. A breakup model was adopted partly reflecting laboratory experiments. With a simple object accumulation model the debris environment evolution was evaluated, under realistic debris mitigation scenarios to be adopted in the near future. (C) 1999 COSPAR.

AB The natural world is certainly not organised through a central thread of control. Things happen as the result of the actions and interactions of unimaginably large numbers of independent agents, operating at all levels of scale from nuclear to astronomic. Computer systems aiming to be of real use in this real world need to model, at the appropriate level of abstraction, that part of it for which it is to be of service. If that modelling can reflect the natural concurrency in the system, it ought to be much simpler
   Yet, traditionally, concurrent programming is considered to be an advanced and difficult topic - certainly much harder than serial computing which, therefore, needs to be mastered first. But this tradition is wrong.
   This talk presents an intuitive, sound and practical model of parallel computing that can be mastered by undergraduate students in the first year of a computing (major) degree. It is based upon Hoare's mathematical theory of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), but does not require mathematical maturity from the students - that maturity is pre-engineered in the model. Fluency can be quickly developed in both message-passing and shared-memory concurrency, whilst learning: to cope with key issues such as race hazards, deadlock, livelock; process starvation and the efficient use of resources. Practical work can be hosted on commodity PCs of UNIX workstations using either Java or the Occam multiprocessing language. Armed with this maturity, students are well-prepared for coping with real problems on real parallel architectures that have, possibly, less robust mathematical foundations.

AB Microbial purification capacity is an important factor in natural self-regulation in water. Evaluating the fate of biodegradable organic pollution downstream from the discharge seems an appropriate way to follow the effect of pollution and its hazard assessment, which dictates the needed sanitation measures. We suggest a simple test for such monitoring. A modification of the additional oxygen demand test, standardised in Ausgewahlte Methoden der Wasseruntersuchung, was applied in two river case studies. The additional oxygen demand is a measure of the capability and rate of biodegradation of known organic substance as well as of the amount and activity of heterotrophic organisms in the river. The original test using peptone and glucose as additional feedings of BOD samples was modified by the use of other organic biodegradable model substances characteristic for individual industrial pollutants. The test was found to be an excellent indicator of adapted microorganisms, which are essential for the biodegradation of the appointed organic substances downstream of their discharge into the receiving stream.

ID TESTS
AB Biodegradation is confirmed as an important mechanism of organic chemicals removal in natural systems. Estimation of biodegradability of chemicals which reach the aquatic environment in significant or even negligible quantities is necessary in assessing the entire hazard associated with their use. The aim of our study was to compare the standardized ready biodegradability assessment test (closed bottle test) and its modifications, employing the basic agreements on test principles of simulation of biodegradation in surface waters, yet no official standard method has been adopted. The standard test was modified using various natural river waters and a variety of nutrient conditions and microbial species trying to simulate the natural environment in the simplified way. Tests were performed with two compounds with different ability to degrade. Experiments indicate that predictability of biodegradation obtained by ready biodegradability assessment tests for surface waters in many cases is not reliable, because of different conditions, which may prevail in surface waters over time and affect biodegradation.

AB The union of a healthy egg and a healthy sperm is required for propagation of mammalian species, and thus any factor that disrupts the normal production of female or male gametes is a potential threat to reproductive performance. These hazards to gonadal function are derived from both clinical and environmental sources, and can affect either somatic cell or germ cell lineages, or in some cases both, with equal consequences, i.e. the loss of fertility. Females of the species are particularly at risk to gonadal toxicants since, unlike males, females are born with an irreplaceable stockpile of germ cells in their ovaries at the time of birth. Natural selection processes further dwindle this precious reserve such that by the time of puberty, when eggs could actually be used for fertilization and pregnancy, the number of remaining oocytes has been depleted to less than three-quarters of the starting cohort. In the human female, this completely normal loss of oocytes eventually leads to near-exhaustion of the germ cell reserve around the fifth decade of life, and the menopause ensues. Consequently, exposure of women to potentially damaging agents, such as anti-cancer drugs, industrial chemicals or even cigarette smoke, can have a dramatic and irreparable effect on the ovary by accelerating the natural process of germ cell depletion and, as a direct consequence, advance the time to menopause. This mini-review attempts to bring together these concepts from a molecular biological standpoint, and further offers the hypothesis that many gonadal toxicants exert their effects via modulation of discrete signaling pathways linked to apoptotic cell death in the female germline.

AB Background-The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of and the risk factors associated with progression of renal artery disease in individuals with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS).
   Methods and Results-Subjects with greater than or equal to 1 ARAS were monitored with serial renal artery duplex scans. A total of 295 kidneys in 170 patients were monitored for a mean of 33 months. Overall, the cumulative incidence of ARAS progression was 35% at 3 years and 51% at 5 years. The 3-year cumulative incidence of renal artery disease progression stratified by baseline disease classification was 18%, 28%, and 49% for renal arteries initially classified as normal, <60% stenosis, and greater than or equal to 60% stenosis, respectively (P=0.03, log-rank test). There were only 9 renal artery occlusions during the study, all of which occurred in renal arteries having greater than or equal to 60% stenosis at the examination before the detection of occlusion. A stepwise Cox proportional hazards model included 4 baseline factors that were significantly associated with the risk of renal artery disease progression during follow-up: systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg (relative risk [RR]=2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.5), diabetes mellitus (RR=2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.3), and high-grade (>60% stenosis;or occlusion) disease in either the ipsilateral (RR=1.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0) or contralateral (RR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8) renal artery.
   Conclusions-Although renal artery disease progression is a frequent occurrence, progression to total renal artery occlusion is not. The risk of renal artery disease progression is highest among individuals with preexisting high-grade stenosis in either renal artery, elevated systolic brood pressure, and diabetes mellitus.

ID MITRAL-VALVE-REPLACEMENT; REOPERATIONS
AB Background. Results of valvular reoperations depend on extrinsic and patients' intrinsic risk factors. New prosthetic substitutes continue to appear and the clinical effect is difficult to evaluate. Randomized studies are limited by patient selection and follow-up time. We followed the patient-centric outcome research applied to a large database of valvular operations.
   Methods. Between January 1, 1970 and January 1, 1995 755 patients underwent one reoperation, 96 a second reoperation, and 12 a third reoperation. On January 1, 1996 a common closing date follow-up was obtained in 98.7% of reoperated patients. Multivariable analysis in the hazard domain was applied to obtain an upgradable model of survival that could be used for predictions and treatment comparison.
   Results. postoperative death hazard showed an early phase merging within 6 months with a constant low hazard phase. The survival proportion was 0.65 (70% CL, 0.63 to 0.67) at 5 years, 0.51 (70% CL, 0.49 to 0.53) at 10 years, 0.47 (range, 0.44 to 0.49) at 15 years, 0.42 (70% CL, 0.39 to 0.46) at 20 and 25 years. Significant incremental risk factors for early mortality were reoperative era 1970 to 1980 (hazard ratio = 2.8), reoperation number (hazard ratio = 1.9), heart penetration on surgery (hazard ratio = 7.6), emergent operation (hazard ratio = 5.8), urgent operation (hazard ratio = 2.1), prosthetic thrombosis (hazard ratio = 2.4), acute prosthetic endocarditis (hazard ratio = 3.0), acute endocarditis of the natural valve at antecedent operation (hazard ratio = 3.2), original floppy valve pathology (hazard ratio = 3.2), and mitroaortic replacement (hazard ratio = 5.7). Isolated mitral reoperation had a lower risk (hazard ratio = 0.5). Significant incremental risk factors for constant phase were: operative era (1970 to 1980) (hazard ratio = 2.0), congestive heart failure (hazard ratio = 2.6), reoperation on tricuspid valve after previous mitral insertion (hazard ratio = 4.9), reoperation for recurring dehiscence (hazard ratio = 4.6), double-valve procedure (hazard ratio = 1.6), coronary artery bypass graft (hazard ratio = 2.7), aortic root disease at original operation (hazard ratio = 2.1), older operative age (hazard ratio = 1.1). Use of bileaflet prosthesis was found to decrease significantly (p = 0.0002) the death risk (hazard ratio = 0.2).
   Conclusions. There is no late uprising hazard, and surviving patients remain exposed to a low risk of death (4% of patients per year). Considering simultaneously the confounding from operative age and operative era and the many concomitant risk factors, survival appears favorably influenced by use of bileaflet valves on reoperation.

DE Antarctica; bathymetry; caldera; Deception Island; deformation
ID SOUTH-SHETLAND ISLANDS
AB Deception Island is a large volcanic centre in Bransfield Strait, a very young marginal basin between the South Shetland Islands and Antarctic Peninsula. It has a historical record of volcanic activity, with the most recent eruption occurring in 1970. The island is a stratovolcano with a large flooded caldera forming a natural harbour known as Port Foster. It has been a focus of human activity since early last century, as a base for whaling and sealing expeditions and the locus of several scientific stations. During that period, many bathymetric surveys were carried out, the earliest in 1829 and the most recent in 1993. This study concentrates on surveys from 1948 onwards. Because Port Foster can be classified as a restless caldera, the bathymetric records were analysed for evidence of volcano-tectonic deformation, particularly caldera resurgence (uplift) which could have significant consequences for hazard and risk assessments of the volcano. The results show that a distinctive pattern of shallowing and uplift is present, correlating well with known and inferred volcanic and volcano-tectonic processes on the island. In particular, bathymetric records between 1949 and 1993 show uplift rates as high as 0.3-015 m a(-1), far exceeding normal sedimentation rates in a caldera this size. Rapid uplift in an arcuate offshore area not affected by the sedimentation of recent eruptions suggests that volcano tectonic resurgence or tectono-magmatic effects of an upward migrating magma chamber present a significant risk to the considerable human activity taking place in the region.

AB Aims To assess the natural history, risk factors for death and deterioration of patients with Eisenmenger Syndrome.
   Methods The clinical course of 188 patients from three different cardiac centres specialized in adult congenital heart defects, followed for a median period of 31 years, was retrospectively analysed. According to the diagnosis, 64 males and 124 females, mean age at last follow-up 33.02 +/- 12.8 years, were divided into two groups: simple (128) and complex (60) congenital heart disease. Events analysed were: time variation of Ability Index, pulmonary and cerebral complications, non-cardiac surgery, urate metabolism and renal function, arrhythmias, pregnancy and contraception, medical therapy and transplantation, death from all causes and sudden death.
   Results Eighty-four percent of the overall population showed a satisfactory Ability Index (1 and 2) at the first attendance (median age 25 years). Patients with complex heart disease and Eisenmenger reaction had earlier clinical deterioration (18.6 +/- 11.3 vs 26.7 +/- 12.2) and shorter survival (25.8 +/- 7.9 vs 32.5 +/- 14.6 years). Thirty-eight (20.2%) patients had at least one episode of haemoptysis between 20 and 40 years of age but it did not modify overall survival; 25 (13.2%) had pulmonary thromboembolism at a mean age of 35.2 +/- 13.4 years. Fifteen (7.9%) had a stroke and 7 (3.7%) a cerebral abscess at a mean age of 31.4 +/- 15.7 and 24.1 +/- 4.9 years, respectively. Cerebral complications influenced the quality of life but did not modify survival. Patients who had venesection showed a 2.04 times greater hazard ratio for haemoptysis. Venesection did not reduce cerebral complications and in 20% caused anaemia and iron deficiency. Other non-cardiac surgery with general anaesthesia carried risks (23.5% of deaths). Significant maternal mortality (27%) in relation to pregnancy occurred with constant deterioration in physical status, high incidence of spontaneous abortions (35.8%) and cardiac abnormalities in offspring (20%). Sixty-one patients died during follow-up, mainly by sudden death (29.5%), heart failure (22.9%) and from haemoptysis (11.4%). Eight patients had heart and lung transplantation and five died 1 week to 4 years after transplant. Deterioration in Ability Index (worsening symptoms), age, complex defects, blood creatinine level, right ventricular dysfunction and noncardiac surgery were variables which affected the prognosis adversely with uni- and multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions patients with Eisenmenger syndrome can survive to the seventh decade with informed medical care and protection from special risks.

AB Various studies have investigated potential predictors of age at natural menopause but have produced inconsistent results. The relationship between age at natural menopause and socioeconomic, reproductive, and health behavioral factors was evaluated using longitudinal data from 5961 Australian female twins, aged 17 to 88 years at the time of study. The sample consisted of women voluntarily enrolled in the Australian Twin Registry. Failure-time analysis was the principal statistical method used to handle censored observations. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed the overall median age at natural menopause to be 51 years (95% confidence interval, 50-51). Median age at menopause was earlier for women with earlier birth year, women with late age of menarche, women who had no children, or women who were smokers. Differences in age at menopause between social, occupational, and educational groups were statistically significant (Mantel-Cox test, p < 0.001) for education, major occupational classification, combined income, and self-rated social class, with higher age at menopause for higher levels of each variable, A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the odds ratio of the occurrence of natural menopause among different subgroups, adjusted to reflect simultaneous effects of all other significant covariates. This large study provided clear trends of association in predictors relating to age at menopause. These trends may help to resolve uncertainties and conflicting results identified in studies of comparable white samples. The nature of the twin data also sets a solid background for future analyses of genetic and environmental variance components using statistical modeling or related methods.

AB Objective: To determine whether active tuberculosis alters the rate of progression of HIV infection in dually infected patients.
   Methods: HIV-seropositive patients at two Bronx, New York hospitals with tuberculosis confirmed by culture from July 1992 to February 1995, who survived the initial hospitalization for tuberculosis, were matched on gender, age, CD4(+) percentage, and calendar time with HIV-seropositive patients without tuberculosis participating in a study of the natural history of HIV infection. Patients received follow-up observation prospectively until May 23, 1995 to determine survival rates and development of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (OIs).
   Results: 70 patients had tuberculosis; 120 did not. Mean CD4+ percentages were 12.4% and 12.5%, respectively. At study entry, 27% of those with tuberculosis had prior AIDS-defining OIs other than tuberculosis, compared with 10% of those without tuberculosis (p = .004). In multivariate survival analysis, controlling for CD4+ level, tuberculosis was not an independent predictor of increased other causes of AIDS-related mortality. However, in a logistic regression model, independent predictors of subsequent OIs included tuberculosis (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.9, 8.7), CD4(+) count <100/mm(3) (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1, 5.0) and prior OIs (hazard ration, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.3, 8.3).
   Conclusions: Tuberculosis was not an independent predictor of increased nontuberculosis-related mortality in HIV-seropositive patients but was associated with increased risk of development of OIs.

TI Sea-level rise and related potential hazards on the Argentine coast
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE spectral techniques; storm surges; impacts; coastal erosion
AB The potential consequences of an eventual acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise on the Argentine coast are considered in the light of the long-term trend in sea-level variation, the impacts that the Argentine coastal areas are undergoing from natural and anthropogenic processes, and the human activities that develop there. Water-level variations were determined from hourly tide height records for Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, Quequen, and Puerto Madryn. The series used for Buenos Aires (1905-1992) and Quequen (1918-1981) presented no gaps. For Mar del Plata (1954-1992) there were gaps in April and June 1981, November and December 1986, and February and March 1987, while Puerto Madryn (1945-1983) showed a gap in May 1982. By suitably completing these gaps the corresponding series of annual levels, calculated as means of monthly mean values, were obtained. Symmetric, low-pass filters with Kaiser-Bessel windows were used to attenuate the contributions from periodic components ranging between 8 and 19 years. The filtered series were subjected to spectral analysis through the Fast Fourier Transform method, recolored in the frequency domain and antitransformed again. The results were used to perform linear regression analyses whose slopes indicated a long-term trend in water-level of +1.6 +/- 0.1 mm/year for Buenos Aires, +1.4 +/- 0.5 mm/year for Mar del Plata, +1.6 +/- 0.2 mm/year for Quequen, and +3.5 +/- 0.1 mm/year for Puerto Madryn. Examples of a rise in water level associated with a storm surge are given to show how this phenomenon affect the Argentine coast. Beach erosion from an accelerated rise in sea-level is quantified for a sector of the sandy shores of the Province of Buenos Aires using the well-known Bruun model. Other likely impacts, particularly on human activities, are also mentioned.

AB Changes in tooth survival probabilities over a person's lifetime have remained largely unexplored. The goal of this study was to evaluate changes in the 45-year tooth survival probabilities in a cohort of 565 Norwegian males who were examined in 1969 as young adults, and followed up into mid-life (examination years and sample sizes (n): 1971 (n = 381), 1973 (n = 292), 1975 (n = 245), 1981 (n = 228), 1988 (n = 202), and 1995 (n = 223). The results indicated that the tooth survival probabilities varied considerably both (i) among teeth within individuals, and (ii) over time. The 45-year survival probabilities for the 28 teeth fell into the following ranges: larger than 95% for incisors and cuspids; between 84% and 92% for premolars; and between 59% and 96% for molars. Over the first 4 post-eruptive decades, the tooth mortality risks (excluding orthodontic extractions) were: Ist decade, 2.0% (from 1.7 to 2.4%); 2nd decade, 0.2% (from 0.1 to 0.4%); 3rd decade, 0.6% (from 0.4 to 0.8%); and 4th decade, 1.1% (from 0.8 to 1.5%). The tooth mortality risks in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th decades were probably somewhat underestimated (due to dropout bias), suggesting that the true underlying tooth mortality hazard function may have been V-shaped. The conclusions were that the tooth mortality hazard during the first 4 post-eruptive decades was bathtub-shaped and that it varied considerably among teeth within individuals.

TI Residues - A food safety problem?

LA English

ID VETERINARY DRUG RESIDUES; PRECOCIOUS SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT; PUERTO-RICO;

AB Considerable time, regulation and consumer concern is associated with the question of chemical residues in food. Potential residues in food span a broad range from natural contaminants (mycotoxins) through environmental contaminants (dioxins, PCBs), agrochemicals (nitrates, pesticides), veterinary drugs (anthelmintics, antibiotics), prohibited substances (hormonal growth promoters), chemicals arising in processing (nitrosamines), packaging components (plasticisers) to contaminants arising in domestic food preparation (heavy, metals). The occurrence or avoidance of these chemicals as residues in food is to a greater or lesser extent under the control of the food producer, processor and consumer in the activities of growing/producing, treating, storing, processing, packaging and cooking. The fundamental question is to what extent do or can residues in food constitute a food safety hazard for the consumer. Many of these substances are regulated as to their use and as to their acceptable levels in food while others, by their nature, arise as more random occurrences and, as such, are less prone to regulation. Of particular concern to the producer, processor and retailer of food is what steps may be taken to ensure that the food supply is safe. Best practice in plant and animal husbandry by the producer, in sourcing of material and in control of food manufacturing by the processor, and in sourcing of food products by the retailer combine to assure the safety of food to the consumer. This paper describes the various classes of chemicals which can arise as residues in food, particularly agrochemicals and veterinary drugs, the usage patterns which decrease/increase the likelihood of the occurrence of residues at unacceptable levels, how and in what form(s) residues can occur in foods, and the contribution of food processing to a reduction or otherwise of residue levels in food consumed. Consideration will be given, also, to quantifying the risk posed by chemical residues in food and to a study of the results from a Residue Database and from residue monitoring/surveillance as an indicator of risk to the consumer.

   MANAGEMENT; RECIPIENTS; SURVIVAL
AB Background: In lung transplantation, obliterative bronchiolitis is the major factor limiting long-term survival. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), defined as staged decline in pulmonary function has proved a reproducible and sensitive marker of obliterative bronchiolitis.
   Methods: The incidence of, and risk factors for, BOS were investigated in 230 lung transplant recipients who underwent transplantation from April 1984 to December 1995 and who survived at least 3 months after operation. Progression and prognosis was investigated in the 109 cases with development of BOS.
   Results: Actuarial BOS-free probability at 5 years was 36%. Post-BOS onset survival was 51% at 3 years. BOS onset conferred increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 5.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.61, 9.83). Donor and recipient characteristics such as sex, age, underlying disease, type of transplant, and graft ischemic time did not affect BOS onset, progression, or prognosis. Cytomegalovirus serologic status and early acute rejection were risk factors for BOS onset in multivariate modeling. In univariate analysis, other risk factors were lung infection, cytomegalovirus episodes, organizing pneumonia, and human leukocyte antigen mismatch. Later transplantation era (1991 to 1995) was associated with decreased risk of BOS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44, 0.92). Acute rejection affected post-BOS progression (HR, 1.28/episode; 95% CI, 1.12, 1.45) and survival (HR, 1.20/episode; 95% CI, 1.05, 1.37). Post-BOS lung infection was an independent prognostic factor (HR, 1.12/episode; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.24). BOS onset in the later half of the series (1992 to 1997) was associated with decreased risk of progression (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33, 0.82).
   Conclusions: This study confirms that BOS is a major problem in lung transplantation, with a high incidence, rapid progression, and poor survival. It affects all modes of lung transplantation, regardless of sex, age, or underlying diagnosis. Acute rejection is a major prognostic factor. Lung infections after BOS onset worsen survival rates.

DE moral hazard; state-contingent production; point-source pollution;
   principal-agent problem
AB Two basic representations of principal-agent relationships, the 'state-space' and 'parameterized distribution' formulations, have emerged. Although the state-space formulation appears more natural, analytical studies using this formulation have had limited success. This paper develops a state-space formulation of the moral-hazard problem using a general representation of production under uncertainty. A closed-form solution for the agency-cost problem is derived. Comparative-static results are deduced. Next we solve the principal's problem of selecting the optimal output given the agency-cost function. The analysis is applied to the problem of point-source pollution control.

ID POLICY
AB State policy designed to stimulate reluctant local governments to take risk reduction actions has mixed results. Incentive and collaborative policies meet with considerable variation in local responses. Direct state regulatory policy is effective in especially high risk areas, but has limited geographic coverage. Planning mandates induce widespread local response to natural hazards, but local implementation varies considerably, with differences in the effects of mandated design features. The article suggests that different regulatory and incentive policy mixes be used to entice local involvement. Policy mixes should be adapted to the differences in local governments' commitment and technical capabilities.

AB Recent dense deployments of portable seismographs along the Hikurangi subduction zone have provided insights into the structure and seismic strain regime of the subducted and overlying plates, and the nature of plate coupling at the shallow part of the plate interface. Beneath Marlborough, the plates appear to be permanently locked, and large subduction thrust events are not expected. In the Wellington and Wairarapa regions, the plates appear to be strongly coupled over a downdip width of the plate interface of c. 70 km. Subduction thrust earthquakes of about M-W 8.0 are estimated for this region. Farther to the northeast, the downdip width of the inferred locked portion of the plate interface progressively decreases, and subduction thrust events of about M-W 6.9 are estimated for the northern part of the Raukumara Peninsula. In the south of the subduction zone, changes in coupling arise principally from changes in the thickness of the subducted plate, whereas in the north they are mainly due to changes in thickness of the overlying plate. Tectonic rotations within the overlying plate observed paleomagnetically appear to be a natural consequence of changes in plate coupling along the subduction zone.

AB The northern part of Albania has been the focus of an intense effort by the Seismological Institute of Albania, for in this area two of the country's biggest reservoirs are located. Three years before the impounding of the Fierza reservoir, a four-station network was installed around it. The possibility of induced seismicity continued after the impoundment of the Fierza reservoir in 1978 and the Komani reservoir, in 1985. The seismicity of the zone and some aspects of induced seismicity including: temporal correlation of seismicity with water level changes, spatial patterns in seismicity, frequency-magnitude relations, fault plane solutions etc., are studied during this period. The presence in this zone of a very important transverse fault, the Shkoder-Peja fault, makes the study of induced seismicity from Fierza and Komani reservoirs even more significant. The studies have shown that the impounding of the Fierza and Komani reservoirs has modified the natural course of microearthquake energy release, increasing the number of swarms in this area.
   The fluctuation of the water level in these two reservoirs, in due course, is a potentially important factor in the evaluation of seismicity for Northern Albania and especially in the hazard assessment of this region.

AB Genetic hazards associated with the stocking of fish juveniles produced in hatcheries were studied with simple mathematical models. Domestication is the process of acquiring a genetic characteristics that are advantageous in a hatchery environment but that are disadvantageous in a natural environment due to the selection pressure in the hatchery differing from that in the natural environment. Conditions for the propagation of mutants enhancing domestication were obtained for a variety of stocking strategies specified by parameters related to hatchery productivity and kind of brood stock used. By using this, the possibility of reducing the risk of domestication was studied. As a means of reducing the risk, selective use of wild-born individuals for brood stock was considered. The effectiveness of this was analyzed for both the cases where all brood stock is collected from the wild, and the male brood stock is collected from the wild and the female brood stock is born and reared in a hatchery. We also estimate how much hatchery release can be increased without increasing the risk by employing these means. It is concluded that the use of only male brood stock from the wild is not very effective in reducing the risk of domestication. Further, it is concluded that selective use of the wild-born individuals of both sexes for brood stock is highly desirable if the contribution of released individuals to the natural reproduction is high. In other words, substantial increase of hatchery release may be possible while keeping risk at a level comparable to that under moderate hatchery release, if it is accompanied by the selective use of wild-born individuals for brood stock.

AB Background: Host genetic factors, such as HLA alleles, play an important role in mediating the course of HIV-1 disease progression through largely undefined mechanisms.
   Objectives: To examine the association of HLA markers with HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and other factors associated with course of disease progression in HIV-1 infection.
   Design and methods: A group of 139 HIV-1 seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study had been typed for a variety of HLA markers. HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load was measured from frozen plasma specimens obtained approximately 9 months following seroconversion. CD4+ cell counts were available from the same study visit. Statistical analysis was performed using survival techniques and linear regression models to quantify the relative associations of an HLA score profile, HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load, CD4+ cell count and age with each other and with rate of progression to AIDS and death.
   Results: Cox proportional hazards models showed statistically significant differences in time to AIDS by HLA score profile category per unit increase [relative hazard (RH), 0.64; P < 0.0001], HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load per 10-fold increase (RH, 2.04; P = 0.0003), and CD4+ cell count per 100 cell (x 10(6)/l) increase (RH, 0.90; P = 0.02). Multivariate linear regression showed that viral load was 39% lower (P = 0.0001) for each unit increase in HLA score profile and 13% lower (P = 0.002) for each 100 cell (x 10(6)/l increase in CD4+ cell count.
   Conclusions: The means by which the HLA score profile influences the time to AIDS is probably through immunologic responses that affect the rate of HIV-1 replication, as manifested by the HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load during the first 6-12 months following acute infection.

AB Modern radar techniques, and in particular ground based radars, are a powerful tool to observe space objects (natural meteoroids and artificial space debris) on account of their all weather and day-and-night performance. Natural meteoroids are an important component of the near-Earth space environment and represent a potential risk for all Earth-orbiting space platforms, which could significantly increase in coincidence of enhanced (outburst or storm) activity of meteoroid streams. A review of the currently active meteoroid streams suggests that a few streams have shown a quasi-periodic outburst activity in the two last centuries and may even undergo a storm activity in the next few years. The Leonids, the most intense of meteor showers, present a potentially serious damage to spacecraft in November of 1998 and 1999, after the perihelion passage of the parent body. Impact probability values of storm meteoroids on space platforms in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) were calculated using the data recorded during systematic observational campaigns carried out by the FS radar facility Bologna-Lecce in Italy. Meteoroid flux predictions and directionality, and investigation on impact parameters at very high velocities (up to 71 km/s) for penetration, charge production and plasma generation, are relevant aspects to develop strategies for safe deployment of the near Earth-orbiting space platforms.

TI A review of ice and tide observations in the Bay of Fundy
SO ATLANTIC GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CUMBERLAND BASIN; ESTUARY; MARSH
AB Vigorous quasi-equilibrium conditions characterize interactions between land and sea in macrotidal regions. Ephemeral on the scale of geologic time, estuaries around the Bay of Fundy progressively infill with sediments as eustatic sea level rises, forcing fringing salt marshes to form and reform at successively higher levels. Although closely linked to a regime of tides with large amplitude and strong tidal currents, salt marshes near the Bay of Fundy rarely experience overflow. Built up to a level about 1.2 m lower than the highest astronomical tide, only very large tides are able to cover the marshes with a significant depth of water. Peak tides arrive in sets at periods of 7 months, 4.53 years and 18.03 years. Consequently, for months on end, no tidal flooding of the marshes occurs. Most salt marshes are raised to the level of the average tide of the 18-year cycle. The number of tides that can exceed a certain elevation in any given year depends on whether the three main tide-generating factors peak at the same time. Marigrams constructed for the Shubenacadie and Cornwallis river estuaries, Nova Scotia, illustrate how the estuarine tidal wave is reshaped over its course, to form bores, and varies in its sediment-carrying and erosional capacity as a result of changing water-surface gradients. Changing seasons bring about dramatic changes in the character of the estuaries, especially so as ice conditions develop during the second half of the 206-day (7-month) cycle when the difference in height between neap tide and spring tide is increasing, the optimal time for overflow in any season. Maximum ice hazard, including build-up of "ice walls" in Fundy estuaries, occurs one or two months before perigean and spring tides combine to form the largest tide of the cycle. Although "ice walls" and associated phenomena pose hazards for man-made constructions, important natural purposes are served which need to be considered in coastal development and management schemes.

AB Intact, unamended subsoil cores taken from two contrasting field sites were incubated in the laboratory at 12 degrees 0 under aerobic (21% O-2) and anaerobic (1.1-5.5% O-2) conditions. Denitrification of N-15-NO3- diffusing into the cores across a semi-permeable membrane was estimated by: (1) direct observation of N-15- labelled N-2 and N2O and (2) mass balance following sectioning at the end of the experiment. The in situ denitrification potential (rates where the supply of NO3- is not limited by diffusion) was estimated using a finite-difference approximation to a diffusion reaction equation based on comparison of time and depth profiles of NO3- and Br- in the incubated cores. Potentials between 0.2 and 2.5 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) were obtained under low O-2 and natural C concentrations. These results indicate the potential for denitrification in glacial till subsoils to reduce NO3- leaching to ground or surface waters to levels unlikely to result in a pollution hazard. The major product of NO3- reduction in these subsoils was observed to be N-2, rather than the greenhouse gas and catalyst of stratospheric O-3 removal, N2O.

AB This paper summarizes the information on the geology and natural resources of the Jordan Badia Research and Development Programme. The research focused on the issue of the environment in arid lands as an aid to provide practical options for sustainable development. This paper presents results of field studies in the following areas related to the sustainable development of the Safawi area in the northern Jordan Badia; geomorphology, including landform, soil, lands, processes and hazards, geology and physical resources and surface water hydrology. Tertiary-Quarternary continental basalt flows and tuffs cover approximately 11 000 km(2), the majority of the Safawi area. In addition to extensive basalt lava flows, the programme area includes a variety of geological outcrops and potential sources of economic products that include the following: tuff/Scoria, Zeolite/Olivine, Porcellanite, potential sources of aggregate/construction materials, ornamental stone, building stone, basalt for manufacturing of rock wool, and materials suitable for producing lightweight aggregate. The whole of the eastern Badia exhibits major fault systems, many of which were identified from landsat TM images. The system of wadis which drains the Badia is extensive, with the general flow from the north to the south and south-west. A noticeable geomorphic surficial deposit occuring throughout much of the Badia is fine-grained, water-lain sediments that vary in size and character. The local designation for the fine sediment deposits is Qaa. An MSS scene for the area under consideration has been studied. Twelve major geomorphic subdivisions or zones can be identified. Individual land system units have been identified by transversing the programme area. key sites have been visited based on Landsat TM image interpretation. To a large extent, key areas were subdivided after their initial identification on the landsat scene and corroboration in the field. The surface drainage of the Badia region can be broadly divided into wadi systems, areas of distinct channelized flow, and Qaa, predominantly fine-grained sedimentary basins of low relief. Spatial variability in infiltration rates across the wadi-Qaa system were determined from field experiments. Infiltration rates were found to be medium-high in the wadi channels but decrease rapidly for the Qaa materials. Apparently runoff from wadi side slopes will be high, and water storage occurs along the wadi channels while ponding occurs in the Qaa areas.

AB Insurance against natural perils such as flooding can be regarded as a significant element within coastal zone management. Not only does it offer much-needed support to accelerate economic and social recovery following a disaster (coastal resilience), but it can also contribute to impact limitation by using pricing or restrictions on availability of cover to discourage new development in hazard-prone areas. Although the basic principles are well-established and general, the practice of natural hazard insurance differs significantly between those countries (such as the UK) where the insurance market is commercial, and those (such as the USA) where government plays a major role in the provision of insurance. By exploring the nature of risk, it is possible to understand how these two models meet the needs of society in different ways. Underlying the role of insurance is the probabilistic nature of the risk prediction, and this changes as hood data become more precise. It is argued that care will be needed to evolve the structure of the commercial insurance market, and perhaps its relationship with government and planners, if provision is to remain robust and socially-beneficial when the uncertainty in the prediction is reduced. At the same time, as insurers come to appreciate the key role that they play in buffering society against periodic catastrophic environmental impacts, they are increasingly mounting a global lobby to encourage positive action to constrain global climatic change.

AB Two Earth-orbiting radar missions are planned for the near future by NASA - Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and LightSAR. The SRTM will fly aboard the Shuttle using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IFSAR) to provide a global digital elevation map. SRTM is jointly sponsored by NASA and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). The LightSAR will utilize emerging technology to reduce mass and life-cycle costs for a mission to acquire SAR data for Earth science and civilian applications and to establish commercial utility. LightSAR is sponsored by NASA and industry partners.
   The use of IFSAR to measure elevation is one of the most powerful and practical applications of radar. A properly equipped spaceborne IFSAR system can produce a highly accurate global digital elevation map, including cloud-covered areas, in significantly less time and at significantly lower cost than other systems. For accurate topography over a large area, the interferometric measurements can be performed simultaneously in physically separate receive systems. The Spaceborne Imaging Radar C (SIR-C), successfully flown twice in 1994 aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, offers a unique opportunity for global multifrequency elevation mapping by the year 2000. The addition of a C-band receive antenna of approximately 60 m length, extended from the Shuttle bay on a mast, and operating in concert with the existing SIR-C antenna, produces an interferometric pair. It is estimated that the 90% linear absolute elevation error achievable is less than 16 meters for elevation postings of 30 meters. The SRTM will be the first single-pass spaceborne IFSAR instrument and will produce a near-global high-resolution digital topography data set.
   Since LightSAR offers important benefits to both the science community and US industry, an innovative government-industry teaming approach is being explored, with industry sharing the cost of developing LightSAR in return for commercial rights to its data and operational responsibility. LightSAR will enable mapping of surface change. The instrument's high-resolution mapping, along with its quad polarization, dual polarization, interferometric and ScanSAR modes will enable continuous monitoring of natural hazards, Earth's surface deformation, surface vegetation change, and ocean mesoscale features to provide commercially viable and scientifically valuable data products. Advanced microelectronics and lightweight materials will increase LightSAR's functionality without increasing the mass. Dual frequency L/X-band designs have been examined.

AB Weight loss is a common characteristic of advanced stages of HIV infection. Weight changes during the asymptomatic stage of HIV infection have not been well documented and the possible predictive value of early weight loss for progression to AIDS is unknown. In 122 HIV seroconverters, the natural course of body mass index (BMI) following seroconversion was studied. No BMI decline was seen immediately following seroconversion. In the 56 AIDS cases, however, a steep BMI decline of 1.14 kg/m(2) occurred 6 months before AIDS. This BMI decline was more pronounced in those with low CD4(+) T cell counts (<100 x 10(6)/L) at the time of AIDS diagnosis (1.8 kg/m(2)). The relative hazard for progression to AIDS BE a BMI decline of 1.14 kg/m(2) per 6 months was 3.1, which remained similar after adjustment for CD4 count and p24 antigenemia. We conclude that the course of BMI in HIV-1 infection is biphasic: a relatively stable period is followed by a rapid decline in the 6 months preceding onset of AIDS. Furthermore, we found that this steep BMI decline was associated with faster progression to AIDS.

TI Why do venture capital firms exist? Theory and Canadian evidence
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPERFECT INFORMATION; INVESTMENT; INSURANCE; MARKET; MODEL
AB This paper investigates the role of venture capitalists. We view their "raison d'etre" as their ability to reduce the cost of informational informational asymmetries. Our theoretical framework focuses on two major forms of asymmetric information: "hidden information" (leading to adverse selection) and "hidden action" (leading to moral hazard). Our theoretical analysis suggests Sour empirical predictions.
   1. Venture capitalists operate in environments where their relative efficiency in selecting and monitoring investments gives them a comparative advantage over other investors. This suggests strong industry effects in venture capital in vestments. Venture capitalists should be prominent in industries where informational concerns are important, such as biotechnology, computer software, etc., rather than in "routine" start-ups such as restaurants, retail outlets, etc. The latter are risky, in that returns show high variance, but they are relatively easy to monitor by conventional financial intermediaries.
   2. Within the class of projects where venture capitalists have an advantage, they will still prefer projects where monitoring and selection costs are relatively low or where the costs of informational asymmetry are less severe. Thus, within a given industry where venture capitalists would be expected to focus, we would also expect venture capitalists to favor firms with some track records over pure start-ups. To clarify the distinction between point I and point 2, note that point I stales that If we look across investors, we will see that venture capitalists will be more concentrated in areas characterized by significant informational asymmetry. Point 2 says that if we look across investment opportunities, venture capitalists will still favor those situations which provide better information (ns will all other investors). Thus venture capitalists perceive informational asymmetries as costly, but they perceive them as less costly than do other investors.
   3. If informational asymmetries are important, then the ability of the venture capitalist to "exit" may be significantly affected. Ideally, venture capitalists will sell off their share in the venture after it "goes public" on a stock exchange. If; however, venture investments are made in situations where informational asymmetries are important, it may be difficult to sell shares in a public market where most investors are relatively uninformed This concern invokes two natural reactions. One is that many "exits" would take place through sales to informed investors, such as to other firms in the same industry or to the venture's own management or owners. A second reaction is that venture capitalists might try to acquire reputations Soi presenting good quality ventures in public offerings. Therefore, we might expect that the exits that occur in initial public offerings would be drawn from the better-performing ventures.
   4. Finally, informational asymmetries suggest that owner-managers will perform best when they have a large stake in the venture. Therefore, we can expect entrepreneurial firms in which venture capitalists own a large share to perform less well than other ventures. This is moral hazard problem, as higher values of a venture capitalist's share reduce the incentives of the entrepreneur to provide effort. Nevertheless, it might still be bat in a given situation for the venture capitalist to take on a high ownership share, since this might be the only way of getting getting sufficient financial capital into the firm. However, we would still expect a negative correlation between the venture capital ownership share and firm performance.
   Our empirical examination of Canadian venture capital shows that these predictions are consistent with the data. In particular there are significant industry effects in the data, with venture capitalists having disproportionate representation in industries that are thought to have high levels of informational asymmetry. Secondly, venture capitalists favor later stage investment to start-lip investment. Third, most exit is through "insider" sales, particularly management buyouts, acquisitions by third parties, rather than IPOs. However, IPOs have higher returns than other forms of exit. In addition, the data exhibit the negative relationship between the extent of venture capital ownership and firm performance predicted by our analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

   management policy; priority setting; Australia
AB Natural resources management is a multi-faceted discipline. It requires knowledge of the type, quantity and location of our existing natural resources, and information about how these resources are being utilized and impacted upon by human and other natural processes, whether these impacts are beneficial or detrimental and, finally, whether the impacts are reversible or have a permanent effect. Decision-makers need not only the snapshot view, but also a means to assess impact over time as land use and land-use practice change.
   This paper examines a methodology established to examine natural resource usage and the impacts of such usage in an integrated and repeatable fashion. Its heart is in ecological economics - a discipline which, among other things, seeks to combine economic and ecological models. The methodology was trialled initially by using it to estimate the rates of sheet and rill erosion in New South Wales, using the State-wide Resource Information and Accounting System (SRIAS), and loss hazard is estimated in physical and economic terms. The system facilitates the examination of costs to society and individuals of changes in land use and land-use practice.
   New estimates for the parameters of the universal soil loss equation (USLE) are derived and then mapped for the state of New South Wales. The approach is at a much finer scale than has previously been attempted. When the map of hazard of soil loss is compared with earlier maps, the physical hazard is significantly higher in the north of the state.
   Translation of the physical data into an economic perspective adds a new dimension to the information available to decision makers. Organization of data in this manner offers a significant opportunity to improve the cost-effectiveness of resource management. The paper reveals that failure to account for economic as well as physical rates of land degradation is likely to result in inappropriate decisions. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI 'Risks', 'hazards' and life choices: Reflections on health at work
SO SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
DE hazards; health; risk
ID SELF
AB The workplace has been extensively and variously evaluated as an environment which - like others - contains risks to health. This paper unpacks such risk assessment by problematising the relation between hazards and risks. Three positions are set out. In the first (materialist or realist), risks map directly onto underlying real hazards. In the second (constructionist or culturalist), hazards are natural, while risks are social constructions, In the final (postmodern) position, both risks and hazards are Seen as constructions. The paper goes on to consider the implications of the latter position for assessment of risks in the workplace, arguing that risks are often discounted in the on-going choices made by people who do some things called 'work' and evaluate their continuity of sense-of-self as their 'health'.

ID SANDY-LOAM SOIL; WHEAT
AB In arid and semi-arid regions, effluent from subsurface drainage is often saline and in the absence of a natural outlet, its disposal is a serious environmental threat. A field experiment was conducted for 7 years using drainage water of different salinity levels (ECiw=6, 9, 12 and 18.8 dS/m) for irrigation of wheat during the dry winter season. The objective was to find whether crop production would still be feasible and soil salinity would not be increased unacceptably by this practice. The experimental crop was wheat during the winter season and pearl-millet and sorghum in the rainy season, grown on a sandy loam soil provided with subsurface drainage system. All crops were given a pre-plant irrigation with non-saline canal water and subsequently, saline drainage water of different salinity levels was used for the irrigation of wheat as per the treatment. On an average, the mean yield reduction in wheat yield at different ECiw was 4.2% at 6, 9.7% at 9, 16.3% at 12 and 22.2% at 18.8 dS/m. Pearl-millet and sorghum yields decreased significantly only where 12 dS/m or higher salinity water was applied to previous wheat crop. The high salinity and sodicity of the drainage water increased the soil salinity and sodicity in the soil profile during the winter season, but these hazards were eliminated by the subsurface drainage during the ensuing monsoon periods. The results obtained provide a promising option for the use of poor quality drainage water for the irrigation of winter wheat without undue yield reduction and soil degradation.

AB The Diet, Activity, and Reproduction in Colon Cancer (DARCC) study is a large, multi-center case-control study of colon cancer. We examined family histories of cancer among first-degree relatives obtained by computer-assisted in-person interviews from the DARCC to study the impact of family histories of several cancers and colorectal polyps on colon cancer risk. We examined familial cancer risks both by treating a family history of polyps or cancer as a covariate in a logistic regression model, and by comparing cancer or polyp incidence among relatives of cases to incidence among relatives of controls in a proportional hazards model. There were few differences between the odds ratios (OR) or confidence intervals (CI) generated from logistic regression models and the hazard rate ratios (HRR) generated from the proportional hazards models. Overall, the OR of colon cancer among subjects with a family history of colorectal cancer was 1.77. There were only minor differences in risk by sex, age and subsite, A family history of colorectal polyps also increased risk by about the same amount as a family history of colorectal cancer. The increased risk associated with a family history of polyps did not appear to decrease with age. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objectives. This study analyzed the prospective association between attending religious services and all-cause mortality to determine whether the association is explainable by 6 confounding factors: demographics, health status, physical functioning, health habits, social functioning and support, and psychological state.
   Methods. The association between self-reported religious attendance and subsequent mortality over 5 years for 1931 older residents of Marin County, California, was examined by proportional hazards regression. Interaction terms of religion with social support were used to explore whether other forms of social support could substitute for religion and diminish its protective effect.
   Results. Persons who attended religious services had lower mortality than those who did not (age- and sex-adjusted relative hazard [RH] = 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] =0.52, 0.78). Multivariate adjustment reduced this relationship only slightly (RH = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.62, 0.94), primarily by including physical functioning and social support. Contrary to hypothesis, religious attendance tended to be slightly more protective for those with high social support.
   Conclusions. Lower mortality rates for those who attend religious services are only partly explained by the 6 possible confounders listed above. Psychodynamic and other explanations need further investigation.

TI Intermittent claudication and risk of cardiovascular events
SO ANGIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTERIAL-DISEASE
AB To determine the natural history of intermittent claudication, 110 patients were followed up for a mean period of 24.4 +/-1.2 months. Four patients died during the follow-up. Of the survivors, 24 experienced a nonfatal cardiovascular event, myocardial infarction being the most frequent. Cumulative cardiovascular morbidity was 29% at 3 years. Cox proportional-hazards analysis showed initial ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) as a significant predictor for nonfatal cardiovascular events (p<0.002). With an initial ABPI >0.70, cardiovascular morbidity rate was 12% compared with 33% for those with Initial ABPI ranging from 0.70 to 0.50, and 60% for those with ABPI <0.50 (p<0.005). Critical limb ischemia occurred in only four patients, amputation was required in two, and arterial reconstruction in five. Of the 85 patients who participated in the treadmill test, maximum walking capacity worsened in 26% and improved in 27%. This study elucidates the neglected area of cardiovascular morbidity in intermittent claudication. It has shown that ABPI identifies a subgroup of patients for whom the risk of cardiovascular events is especially pronounced. On the other hand, based on objective evaluation of the patient status, the relatively benign prognosis for the claudicant limb has been confirmed.

AB North American ginseng is native to the deciduous forest region of eastern North America but is now cultivated in areas well beyond its natural range. In recent years an expanding market has attracted growers in climatically less suitable regions, including the Canadian prairies. The ginseng root requires at least four years to reach marketable size and is sensitive to injury when the temperature drops below about -4 degrees C. Such temperatures are not unusual in the prairies; thus winter kill is a hazard that may limit ginseng production in this region of Canada. This study analyses the risks of winter soil temperatures falling below levels critical for the survival of ginseng in Saskatchewan, It appears that winter conditions may be too severe for reliable production of this lucrative crop, although application of straw mulch and additional benefits of trapped snow could reduce the risk of winter kill.

SO HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES

AB Land use describes human activities on the earth, and forms a major element of the terrestrial ecosystem modified by humans in the Himalayan region, where developmental activities are increasing rapidly to support the tourism infrastructure. The unprecedented growth in population is putting extremely high pressure on the limited land available for cultivation. Land use and agricultural practices have undergone drastic changes since the mid-1960s through the introduction of development programmes and the application of various newly developed techniques in agrosciences. An analysis of the land use as it has occurred over the last 70 years suggests that it and property rights in the Upper Beas Basin are complex and dynamic. For example, people are giving importance to orchards because of their high profitability. Thus, some agricultural land has been encroached on by orchards. In addition, wastelands are now being used by people for orchards, agriculture and residential and commercial building. Since the Upper Beas River Basin is mountainous, it is fragile and prone to processes like soil erosion, slope instability, landslides and floods. Risks from natural hazards are increasing. However, the state of ecohydrological responses highlight that human-induced ecological changes can be largely proved at the microwatershed level. The findings are not extended to the Himalayan scale. There is also an uncertain correlation between anthropogenic activities (deforestation) in the mountains and hazards in the plains such as floods. Owing to a lack of basic research, there is little effective information which cannot be used for long-term effective monitoring of ecological and hydrological responses to global change. Such an uncertain situation calls for integrated watershed management and development using geographical information systems (GISs). (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Environmental hazard from fissures in the Main Ethiopian Rift
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB For the last few decades, following increasing development and settlement programmes, several reports of destruction of communication lines, arable land and dwellings by sedimentary fissures, as compared to fissures in hard rocks, have been reported in the Main Ethiopian Rift, which is the northern part of the East African Rift System. With several more settlement and construction programmes underway in the region, better knowledge of the distribution and causes of this emerging natural hazard has become critical to the further development of the region. This paper firstly aims to make a preliminary survey of the extent of reported occurrences of the fissures, in particular the sedimentary fissures. Secondly, the problem is considered in light of the geology, geophysics and tectonics of the region to understand the distribution, occurrence and evolution of the sedimentary fissures. Thirdly, the damage the fissures have caused since they started to be reported is compared with those of earthquakes for the same period of time in the region. This shows them to be an important emerging hazard. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

   stochastic model; poisson process; upcrossing rate
AB To assess the collapse risk of transmission line structures subject to natural hazards, it is important to identify what hazard may cause the structural collapse. In Australia and many other countries, a large proportion of failures of transmission line structures are caused by severe thunderstorms. Because the wind loads generated by thunderstorms are not only random but time-variant as well, a time-dependent structural reliability approach for the risk assessment of transmission line structures is essential. However, a lack of appropriate stochastic models for thunderstorm winds usually makes this kind of anaysis impossible. The intention of the paper is to propose a stochastic model that could realistically and accurately simulate wind loading due to severe thunderstorms. With the proposed thunderstorm model, the collapse risk of transmission line structures under severe thunderstorms is assessed numerically based on the computed failure probability of the structure.

AB We present a natural extension of the conventional accelerated failure time model for survival data to formulate the effects of covariates on the mean function of the counting process for recurrent events. A class of consistent and asymptotically normal rank estimators is developed for estimating the regression parameters of the proposed model. In addition, a Nelson-Aalen-type estimator for the mean function of the counting process is constructed, which is consistent and, properly normalised, converges weakly to a zero-mean Gaussian process. We assess the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators and the associated inference procedures through Monte Carlo simulation and provide an application to a well-known bladder cancer study.

AB The number of victims from volcanism and the primary cause(s) of death reported in the literature show considerable uncertainty. We present the results of investigations carried out either in contemporary accounts or in specific studies of eruptions that occurred since A.D. 1783. More than 220 000 people died because of volcanic activity during this period, which includes approximately 90% of the recorded deaths throughout history. Most of the fatalities resulted from post-eruption famine and epidemic disease (30.3%), nuees ardentes or pyroclastic flows and surges (26.8%), mudflows or lahars (17.1%), and volcanogenic tsunamis (16.9%). At present, however, international relief efforts might reduce the effects of post-eruption crop failure and disease, and at least some of the lahars could be anticipated in time by adequate scientific and social response. Thus, mitigation of hazards from pyroclastic flows and tsunamis will become of paramount importance to volcanologists and civil authorities.

AB Landslides are common in steep mountainous areas of Puerto Rico where mean annual rainfall and the frequency of intense storms are high. Each year, landslides cause extensive damage to property and occasionally result in loss of life. Average population density is high, 422 people/km(2), and is increasing. This increase in population density is accompanied by growing stress on the natural environment and physical infrastructure. As a result, human populations are more vulnerable to landslide hazards. The Blanco, Cibuco, and Coamo study areas range in surface area from 276 to 350 km(2) and represent the climatologic, geographic, and geologic conditions that typify Puerto Rico. Maps of recent landslides developed from 1:20,000-scale aerial photographs, in combination with a computerized geographic information system, were used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of shallow landslides in these areas. Several types of landslides were documented-rainfall-triggered debris flows, shallow soil slips, and slumps were most abundant. Hillslopes in the study area that have been anthropogenically modified, exceed 12 degrees in gradient, are greater than 300 m in elevation, and face the east-northeast, are most prone to landsliding. A set of simplified matrices representing geographic conditions in the three study areas was developed and provides a basis for the estimation of the spatial controls on the frequency of landslides in Puerto Rico. This approach is an example of an analysis of the frequency of landslides that is computationally simple, and therefore, may be easily transferable to other settings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical and radiological features at presentation, and the natural history of HIV-related bronchopulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma. A retrospective review of medical records and chest radiographs was performed in 106 HIV-infected homosexual men with bronchopulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosed at bronchoscopy between September 1988 and November 1994. The majority of patients had evidence of advanced HIV disease at diagnosis (median CD4 cell count was 15 x 10(6)/1, range 0-288), and 93% had had a diagnosis of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma for a median duration of 11 months prior to diagnosis of their bronchopulmonary disease. The most frequent symptoms at presentation were cough (92%), dyspnoea (69%), pleuritic pain (20%), haemoptysis (13%) and wheezing (10%). The most common radiological finding in 73% of our series was of poorly defined and confluent opacities, with predominant middle and lower zone involvement. Median survival was 4 months (range 0-37 months) from diagnosis and 9 months (range 1-25) from the onset of symptoms. Treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death (hazards ratio (HR)=0.48, 95% CI=0.26-0.87). Factors associated with a poor survival, after adjustment for treatment effect were older age (HR=1.79, 95% CI=1.22-2.84) for each 10-year increase in age; a history of pleuritic gain (HR=2.97, 95% CI=1.39-6.32); presence of pleural effusion on X-ray (HR=2.01, 95% CI=1.13-3.59) and a prior diagnosis of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (HR=1.8, 95% CI=1.00, 3.24). Bronchopulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma occurs mainly in patients with advanced HIV disease and a prior history of cutaneous disease. Survival is poor, and adverse prognostic factors include older age at diagnosis and the presence of pleural disease.

AB Several clinical studies have suggested that anemia is an independent risk factor for dying in patients with HIV disease. We analyzed data from a large urban HIV clinical practice in Baltimore to assess the annual incidence of anemia, the risk of dying in patients who develop anemia, and the association between recombinant human erythropoietin use to treat anemia and subsequent survival. Ln 2348 patients observed between 1989 and 1996, 498 (21%) developed at least grade 1 anemia (hemoglobin <9.4 g/dl); 95 (4%) developed grade 4 anemia(hemoglobin 16.9 g/dl). Development of anemia was associated with decreased survival, independent of other prognostic factors. Use of erythropoietin was more likely in patients of nonminority race, those who did not inject drugs, those with a lower CD4 count or AIDS, and those being treated for cytomegalovirus disease (p < .05). Adjusting for these factors as well as severity of anemia, age, diagnosis of opportunistic disease, blood transfusion, and antiretroviral therapy in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards analysis, erythropoietin use (ia = 91) was associated with a decreased hazard of dying (relative hazard [RH] = 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.81; p = .002). Although we cannot rule out a treatment selection bias, adjusting for available prognostic factors and factors potentially associated with a decision to use erythropoietin suggests that erythropoietin for treatment of anemia is associated with improved survival in HIV disease.

AB Environmental justice has become a major focus of research within the environmental social sciences. Early studies mostly examined the unequal distribution of natural resource hazards in an advanced capitalist political-economy. More recent studies have quantitatively gauged the relationship between sociodemographic factors and exposure to toxic chemical pollution. In this article, I use presentations at the recent meetings of the American Sociological Association (Toronto, August 1997) to suggest where the third generation of research into environmental justice may be heading. The literature is at a crossroads. We know enough to argue that there is a problem, but we cannot clearly articulate relationships, causation, or policy demands. New research techniques and social theories may begin to allow us to accomplish these more ambitious tasks.

AB Background: For laryngeal carcinoma, the present TNM clinical staging system does not seem completely satisfactory as a guide for providing a prognosis for survival. We believe that natural killer cell activity would probably have a role in a more reliable system. Therefore, we analyzed the disease outcome with previously untreated epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx, evaluating classic clinical and pathologic factors, as well as natural killer cell activity in peripheral blood samples of the patients.
   Objectives: To determine the level of natural killer cell activity in patients with laryngeal carcinoma and to analyze the prognostic value of this finding when associated with other clinical and pathologic variables.
   Design: Prospective cohort study of surveillance of laryngeal cancer. Mean follow-up of 42.8 months.
   Settings: Tertiary care referral center and ambulatory and hospitalized care.
   Participants: We compared 81 men (mean age, 62.4 years; range, 35-89 years) with laryngeal carcinoma with 44 healthy men serving as control subjects (mean age, 57.6 years; range, 37-82 years).
   Results: Natural killer cell activity was significantly reduced in patients who had died of cancer-related causes in comparison with tumor-free survivors. Overall actuarial survival differed significantly in histologically assessed nodal involvement and low natural killer cell activity. Use of the Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that the factors that seem to have a prognostic effect on survival are histologically determined nodal involvement and low natural killer cell activity.
   Conclusions: These results support the prognostic significance of the determination of pretreatment natural killer cell activity in peripheral blood samples from patients with laryngeal carcinoma and suggest that assessment of adding such a determination to the current tumor staging system is advisable.

AB The records of 33 adult patients with supratentorial World Health Organization grade II astrocytoma (A-II) treated between January 1980 and April 1997 at our hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. All tumours were surgically resected or biopsied and their MIB-1 labelling indices (LIs) were less than 1.5%. The median time to tumour progression after the initial surgery was 60 months, and the 5- and 10-year tumour progression-free rates were 53 and 39%, respectively. The median survival time was 107 months, and the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 66 and 43%, respectively. The major cause of death was tumour recurrence with malignant transformation, comprising 93% of all deaths due to unrestrained tumour growth. In a univariate analysis for survival rate by log-rank test, age (< 60 years), Kamofsky Performance Scale score (90-100%), tumour location (except for the basal ganglia), and extent of surgery (more than biopsy) were revealed to be significant positive prognostic factors. A Cox proportional hazard multivariate regression analysis confirmed that the age was the only independent, significant positive prognostic factor in this series. The survival time after the initial surgery in patients without radiotherapy tended to be prolonged compared with those of the patients with radiotherapy. Of the 26 patients who received radiotherapy, however, the survival time after the initial surgery in the nine patients with intraoperative radiotherapy was significantly prolonged compared with the 17 patients who received sole external beam radiotherapy. Gender, symptoms, histology, p53 LI, enhancement on CT/MRI, cyst, calcification and chemotherapy were not shown to be significant prognostic factors. The optimal management strategy for A-II is expected to be established by clarification of the natural history with cytological and molecular biological analyses of the biological features of this disease.

TI Understanding rainfall-landslide relationships in man-modified

AB The expansion of Caramanico Terme in this century has led to the urbanization of marginally stable valley slopes, and this has coincided with the apparent acceleration of landslide processes. Recent landslides on man-modified slopes were caused, but not necessarily triggered, by heavy precipitation (antecedent moisture was a more critical factor than the amount of storm rainfall). Because no important landslides on natural slopes in the same period were reported in the Caramanico area, a clear distinction must be made between natural settings and those modified by man when determining rainfall thresholds for predictive purposes. In recently urbanized mountainous environments, the thresholds used to assess landslide hazards should not be weighted too heavily on old historical records of precipitation and associated mass movements. Instead, more weight ought to be given to the period following the occurrence of any major anthropogenic and natural (e.g. high-magnitude earthquake) modification of slope setting.

AB There is considerable public, regulatory, and scientific concern regarding human exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which include compounds that directly modulate steroid hormone receptor pathways (estrogens, antiestrogens, androgens, antiandrogens) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. Based on quantitative structure-activity relationships for both AhR and estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, the relative potency (RP) of individual compounds relative to a standard (e.g., TCDD and 17 beta-estradiol) have been determined for several receptor-mediated responses. Therefore, the TCDD or estrogenic equivalent (TEQ or EQ, respectively) of a mixture is defined as TEO=Sigma[T-i]x RPi or EQ=Sigma[E-i]x RPi, where T-i and E-i are concentrations of individual AhR or ER agonists in any mixture. This approach for risk assessment of endocrine-disrupting mixtures assumes that for each endocrine response pathway, the effects of individual compounds are essentially additive. This paper will critically examine the utility of the TEQ/EQ approach for risk assessment, the validity of the assumptions used for this approach, and the problems associated with comparing low dose exposures to xeno and natural (dietary) endocrine disrupters.

AB The radon concentration (RC), total potential alpha energy concentration of radon decay products (PAEC), equilibrium factor (F), and the fraction of unattached radon decay products (f(p)) were measured for 94 offices in Hong Kong. The mean values for RC, PAEC, F, and f(p) were 51 Bq m(-3) 1.19x10(-7) J m(-3) (5.7 mWL), 0.43, and 0.13, respectively. The first three are much higher than the corresponding values for dwellings. The radon properties vary significantly for different sites. The time for measurements, cumulative time since the air conditioning system was turned on, and whether smoking is allowed in the office have been identified from the available data as possible factors affecting the radon characteristics in offices. The mean contribution of the lung exposure to the annual effective dose equivalent due to radon in offices has been calculated to be 0.35 mSv y(-1). Considering other sources of natural radiation, a rough estimate of the total annual equivalent dose of about 2.7 mSv for a person living in Hong Kong is obtained. Two simple methods are proposed to mitigate the radon hazard in offices: (1) the provision of smoke-free environments and (2) switching on the air conditioners earlier. The first method reduces the equivalent dose by about 0.13 mSv y(-1) while the second reduces by about 0.1. mSv y(-1), which can be regarded as significant.

AB Livestock sharing man's environment are exposed to an array of toxic pollutants which may be hazardous to their health and production. The health effects of pollution in livestock vary from subtle or chronic intoxication to overt acute toxicities depending on source and kind of pollutant, extent and route of exposure extent and degree of other interacting agents, and species, age, physiology and nutrition of the exposed livestock population. Residue of pollutants in livestock products adversely effect their quality and cause potential threat to public health due to contamination of food chain. In India, problem of pollution is related to poorly planned developmental projects and overuse of natural resources by ever-increasing human population. Review of the work done during the 5 decades of post-independence indicated emerging trend of human and livestock health problems due to pollution in the country. Acute and chronic lead toxicosis, fluorosis and pesticide poisoning have been recognised as major health hazards of pollution in livestock with the increasing frequencies in recent past indicating growing threat of pollution to the livestock health. Scientific data also revealed residual effects of pollutants such as toxic heavy metals and pesticides in animal food products. However, as compared to medical data, fewer studies have been conducted to evaluate ill effects of pollution in livestock in the country. There is a need for intensive studies and also to make recommendations as to how best to limit ill effects of pollution in livestock.

AB Environmental protection and improvement comes at a price, and regulators must ensure that resources are targeted at the highest priority risks. Risk assessment at a strategic level is now an essential tool. Risks can arise from natural sources such as flooding and radon, as well as anthropogenic sources such as discharges of pollutants or the introduction of alien fish species. In deciding which environmental pressure to tackle next, and which to leave, regulators have to compare the full range of risks on a sound and consistent basis. Comparing risks from such diverse sources poses a significant challenge and traditional hazard assessments are now no longer sufficient. Consideration now needs to be given to a much wider range of factors if risk assessment is to be used as an aid to strategic decision-making. In general, Strategic Risk Assessment can be broken down into four main tasks. (i) Harm assessment-where the impact of a given level of exposure on a predefined receptor group is determined. (ii) Risk significance-where the harm evaluated in (i) is placed in the geographical (regional, national international) context in relation to the overall population of receptors, and the range of different receptors. (iii) Risk uncertainty-where the probability of occurrence, exposure and harm is quantified together with the range of uncertainties involved in the overall assessment. (iv) Risk importance-where the costs and benefits of various actions/options together with a measure of society's view of the risk are brought together. All the above have been included in the Strategic Risk Assessment Methodology which has been developed by the Environment Agency, and will be used to direct the organisation's manpower and financial resources to maximise its contribution to sustainable development.

AB The time of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission and the pattern of early plasma viremia as predictors of disease progression were evaluated in infected infants followed from birth. Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated that a 1-log higher HIV-I RNA copy number at birth was associated with a 40% increase in the relative hazard (RH) of developing CDC class A or B symptoms (P = .004), a 60% increase in developing AIDS (P = .01), and an 80% increase in the of risk death (P = .023) over the follow-up period of up to 8 years. the peak HIV-1 RNA copy number for infants during primary viremia was also predictive of progression to AIDS (RH, 9.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.8-54.1; P = .008) and death (RH, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.1-43.8; P = .04). The results indicate that high levels of HIV-1 RNA at birth and during primary viremia are associated with early onset of symptoms and rapid disease progression to AIDS and death in perinatally infected children.

AB On May 13, 1996, a disastrous tornado hit the Tangail district of Bangladesh, killing more than 700 people and causing extensive damage to homes, crops, and livestock. This paper explores and analyzes how tornado victims adjusted to this destruction. Data collected from two study sites show that victims received emergency assistance from people both in neighboring areas and from more distant areas, as well as from government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). At both sites, NGOs played the leading role in minimizing the hardships of victims through extraordinary disaster relief and rehabilitation efforts. Because of the extensive support received, the tornado victims were able to return to their "normal" lives very quickly. This study concludes with several recommendations to help cope with future tornado disasters.

AB Objective: To assess the prognostic value of HIV RNA levels measured shortly after HIV seroconversion and whether markers of immune response (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, IgA and IgG) measured at the same time, continue to provide prognostic information once the HIV RNA level is known.
   Design and methods: HIV RNA levels were measured approximately 2.5 years after seroconversion in 97 haemophilic men followed for up to 17 years. Levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgA and IgG were measured within 1 year of the HIV RNA level. The relationships between these markers and progression to AIDS and death were studied using Kaplan-Meier plots and proportional hazards regression models.
   Results: High HIV RNA levels were associated with faster progression to AIDS and shorter survival in univariate Cox regression models. High IgA and IgG levels were also associated with faster disease progression. In multivariate models, high HIV RNA levels remained independently associated with faster disease progression [relative hazard (RH), 1.86; P = 0.01 for AIDS; RH, 1.66; P = 0.05 for death]. However, high IgA and Ige levels provided strong independent prognostic information for AIDS and death (IgA: RH, 1.38; P = 0.006 for AIDS; RH, 1.33; P = 0.07 for death; IgG: RH, 1.10; P = 0.02 for AIDS; RH, 1.12; P = 0.01 for death).
   Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of the HIV RNA level in assessing the long-term prognosis in individuals infected with HIV. However, our results suggest that immune activation markers, rather than merely reflecting high HIV RNA levels are important in assessing prognosis in their own right. These findings may improve our understanding of HIV pathogenesis and may aid clinical management of patients. (C) 1998 Lippincott-Raven Publishers.

ID PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL
AB Objectives: To show how a spurious association between the calendar year of seroconversion and HIV progression arises as a result of censoring the follow-up of individuals at their last visit, when the individuals' visits are intermittent.
   Design: A notional cohort of 1140 seroconverters and a cohort study of 1270 HIV-infected individuals seroconverted between 1985 and 1994, and followed up to December 1995 (the Italian Seroconversion Study cohort).
   Methods: Failure times and rate of the patients attending the clinic over the study period were simulated for the notional cohort. Three separate scenarios with different probabilities of making a visit were considered. Standard survival analysis techniques were used to assess the effect of the year of seroconversion on HIV progression. The progression to a CD4 cell count of 200 x 10(6)/l according to the calendar year of seroconversion in the Italian Seroconversion Study was assessed using different censoring strategies.
   Results: A spurious effect of the year of seroconversion consistently appeared in 100 repeated simulations. When ignoring the visits occurring after the first year of follow-up in the Italian Seroconversion Study cohort, results supported the hypothesis of no effect of the year from seroconversion.
   Conclusions: The choice of the censoring strategy is crucial when assessing the effect of year of seroconversion using survival analysis in cohort studies with intermittent visit structure. Different censoring strategies should be considered before firmly concluding that more virulent strains or the use of treatment are modifying the natural history of HIV disease from cohort studies of this nature.

AB Objective: To describe the natural history of somatic growth in HIV infection by constructing age-specific growth velocity norms and to assess specific prognostic information available using these norms.
   Design: Observations on 1338 HIV-infected children aged 3 months to 15 years who participated in one of four US clinical trials of pediatric anti-HIV therapies were pooled; baseline growth velocity data were obtained using the first 6 months of observation for each child.
   Methods: Distributions of physical growth velocities in HIV-infected children in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group were computed. Statistical smoothing of growth histories was employed to derive velocity estimates, and quantile regression analysis of growth velocities was performed to allow comparisons of growth rates in age- and gender-heterogeneous cohorts in the context of HIV infection. The quantile regressions provide corrected z-scores for growth velocity that appropriately compare HIV-infected children with one another for the purpose of distinguishing more from less favorable prognoses.
   Results: Consistent deficits in growth velocity amongst HIV-infected children were revealed when compared with the Fels Institute velocity standards. Approximately 33% of height land 20% of weight) age- and sex-corrected velocity measurements obtained in the first 6 months of clinical trial participation lay beneath the corresponding third percentiles of the Fels reference distributions, which are commonly regarded as critical indicators of growth failure. Proportional hazards regression tests indicated that both weight and height velocity contributed significant information on the risk of death among children with AIDS after adjusting for antiretroviral therapy received, CD4 cell counts, and age at trial enrollment. Comparing subjects who differ in initial weight velocity by one age- and sex-corrected SD, the relative hazard of death was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.72; P less than or equal to 0.0001) in favor of the child with greater weight velocity, controlling for antiretroviral therapy received, age and CD4 cell count at baseline. The analogous hazard ratio for height velocity was 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.79; P less than or equal to 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Suitably normalized growth velocities are informative and inexpensive criteria for pediatric AIDS prognosis; the growth velocity distributions presented will be useful for comparing growth effects of new therapeutic strategies to those of single and combination antiretrovirals employed for maintenance of pediatric HIV infection in the mid-1990s.

AB Low levels of chlorine residual and the trihalomethane chloroform can be released from power plant discharges and enter natural surface water bodies. Such effluents may pose potential human health and ecological risks. To evaluate these risks, a model was developed and applied to a time-variable release of these constituents into a river. The release pattern and dose are typical of power plants. In situ formation of chloroform is also simulated. The model is applicable to situations where chloroform is the dominant trihalomethane. Therefore, the model is limited to water with low background bromide ion concentrations (approximately 50 mu g/L or less). For the scenario evaluated, predicted total residual chlorine levels, expressed in terms of a hazard quotient for the protection of aquatic organisms, are above EPA criteria at locations to within approximately 5 km downstream of the discharge; excess lifetime risk to an individual exposed to predicted levels of chloroform in the river range from 5 x 10(-7) to above 10(-6), a degree of risk that is close to levels of concern to regulatory agencies.

AB Objective: To examine differences in progression to AIDS and death between HIV-1-positive Africans (most infected in sub-Saharan Africa and therefore with non-B subtypes) and HIV-I-positive non-Africans in London.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study of 2048 HIV-1-positive individuals.
   Setting: HIV-l-infected individuals attending 11 of the largest HIV/AIDS units in London.
   Patients: Subjects were 1056 Africans and 992 non-Africans seen between 1982-1995.
   Results: There were no differences in crude survival from presentation to death between Africans and non-Africans (median 82 and 78 months, respectively; P = 0.22). Africans progressed more rapidly to AIDS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.45] but after adjustment for age, sex, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category B symptoms and CD4+ lymphocyte count at presentation, year of HIV diagnosis and hospital attended, this difference was no longer significant (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.93-1.43). Africans with AIDS had a reduced risk of death compared with non-Africans (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63-0.96) but not after adjustment for age, CD4+ lymphocyte count at AIDS, initial AIDS-defining conditions (ADC) and hospital attended (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.76-1.27). Tuberculosis as the first ADC was associated with a 64% reduction in the risk of death. CD4+ lymphocyte decline was not significantly different between Africans and non-Africans (P = 0.18).
   Conclusions: Differences in progression to AIDS and death and CD4+ lymphocyte decline between HIV-l-infected Africans and non-Africans in London could not be attributed to ethnicity or different viral subtypes. Age and the clinical and immunological stage at presentation, or AIDS, were the major determinants of outcome. Compared with other diagnoses, tuberculosis as the initial ADC was associated with increased survival. Lack of access to health care and exposure to environmental pathogens are the most likely causes of reduced survival with AIDS in Africa, rather than inherently different rates of progression of immune deficiency due to racial differences or viral subtypes.

TI Framework for forecasting the extent and severity of drought in maize in
   the Free State Province of South Africa
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL; MODEL
AB An effective framework for drought assessment requires a definition of drought severity, a weather-soils database for the relevant region in a geographic information system (GIS), a reliable crop growth model, a method of forecasting daily weather data fr om the present date fill the end of the growing season and a mapping procedure for the graphical representation of a dr ought situation. The development and main features of such a framework (system) which is already in use in the Free State Province of South Africa, is described. Based upon the phase of the southern oscillation index, it has been applied to quantify and map drought hazard in maize by running maize crop growth models in a GIS. Input and output data for the latter are grouped in 9800 homogeneous natural resource zones. For each, computed maize grain yield forecasts are compared against long-term cumulative probability distribution functions of yield to determine their probabilities of non-exceedence and used to delimit drought severity areas accordingly. The system enjoys wide acceptance and credibility in the province. To date, the results have been well received by a rapidly growing number of users, now totalling 360. Major users are grain merchants, importers and exporters, millers, the provincial government and maize producers. No tests of accuracy of the forecasting system have been possible at this stage because the computation procedures and software have only just been completed. A similar project has, however, yielded promising results. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RISK COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; MESSAGES
AB Hazard information/communication campaigns are dealing with important objectives, such as advancing knowledge about hazards for health and safety, influencing risk-related behaviour (both at the workplace and in private contexts). improving emergency preparedness in exposed communities, and facilitating risk conflict resolution. However, are these goals actually achieved by pertinent programs? To answer this question, empirical evaluation with respect to content. process, and outcome criteria is indispensable. Moreover, such research requires a comprehensive psychological model of the information/communication process to be investigated. A review of the risk communication literature, as well as experiences from two case studies tone about technological hazards, i.e., chemical plants, and one about natural hazards, i.e., bushfire), demonstrate that strict requirements are to be met in evaluation studies. Crucial issues include definition of communication aims in advance, sound theoretical conceptualisation of intervention effects, specification of target populations, longitudinal design and appropriate timing of data collection. inclusion of control groups, monitoring implementation and course of the program, control of context influences, and reliability and validity proofs. There is still a lack of comprehensive assessments of hazard information/communication programs, yet evaluation results are the best means to improve respective campaigns. However, as evaluation research is useless if ignored, the comprehensive dissemination of findings is also critical.

AB The high rates of relative vertical crustal movement and frequent seismic events mean that many neotectonic terrains are subject to the extensive development of natural hazards, Neotectonic terrains in tropical areas may be subject to extremes of temperature and high annual precipitation levels, greatly increasing the rate of landscape change and the development of natural hazards. This paper examines the use of geomorphological mapping for the assessment of natural hazards in one such area, Taroko Gorge in eastern Taiwan, and investigates the risk susceptibility of a highway running through the area. The gorge, which comprises a 600-metre deep ravine incised into marble and schist since the Pliocene, is subject to extremely high rates of uplift, intense seismic activity and the direct effects of an average of about two typhoons per annum, each of which may induce precipitation of 600 millimetres or more in 24 hours, with peak rates in excess of 100 millimetres per hour. Hence, Taroko Gorge represents a highly dynamic environment with very high rates of landform change. The research has involved the use of detailed geomorphological mapping of the gorge area to determine the location and magnitude of natural hazards. Monitoring of the gorge has demonstrated that extensive landscape change occurs during high-magnitude events as the intense precipitation induces rockfalls in the jointed marble, triggers landslides in the regolith overlying the schist and mobilizes debris flows on the surface. Detailed records of the size and occurrence of rockfalls and landslides affecting die highway have been obtained and analyzed and, by combining these data with the geomorphological and geological data, a hazard assessment map has been produced for the highway. This map may be used to improve the development of the highway, decreasing the danger for users and the amount of time that the highway is closed.

TI Optimal timing of liver transplantation for primary biliary cirrhosis

ID ALLOCATION; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; MODEL
AB In 1989, we reported on the efficacy of liver transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by demonstrating that the actual patient survival following transplantation was significantly better than without transplantation as predicted by a mathematical survival model ("Mayo natural history model"). Our aim in this investigation was to determine an optimal time to perform liver transplantation in PBC. One hundred forty-three patients with PEC undergoing liver transplantation were followed prospectively. Disease severity was measured immediately before transplantation by a summary score ("risk score") used in the Mayo natural history model, namely age, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, and the presence or absence of edema. Proportional hazards analyses were performed assessing patient survival following transplantation. The influence of disease severity immediately pretransplantation on resource utilization for liver transplantation was assessed. Compared with our report in 1989, liver transplantation was performed at an earlier stage of disease (e.g., median risk score: 7.5 vs. 8.3; P < .01). Following transplantation, patient survival probabilities at 1, 2, and 5 years were 93%, 90%, and 88%, respectively. In the proportional hazards analysis, the risk of death following transplantation remained low until reaching a risk score of 7.8. In contrast, risk scores greater than 7.8 were associated with a progressively increased mortality. Resource utilization measured by the days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital and the requirement for intraoperative blood transfusions was significantly greater in recipients who had higher risk scores before transplantation. Our data suggest that an optimal timing for liver transplantation, as determined by patient survival and resource utilization, appears to be at a risk score around 7.8 in patients with PBC.

AB We assessed the value of HIV-1 RNA level compared to soluble immune activation markers, namely neopterin, beta(2)-microglobulin and soluble TNF receptor 75 (sTNFR-75), to predict the change in the number of CD4+ T cells over a 1-year period, the development of AIDS, and survival (median follow-up 54 months). The study population comprised a cohort of 47 individuals for the analysis of the change in CD4+ T cells and survival (20 died), and a subgroup of 31 individuals with a baseline CD4+ T cells above 200 x 10(6)/1 for the development of AIDS (11 developed AIDS). HIV-1 RNA was measured from stored sera by quantitative PCR. The CD4+ T cell count obtained at study entry strongly con elated with baseline serum HIV-1 RNA levels (r = -0.47), and to a lesser extent with neopterin (r = -0.41) and beta(2)-microglobulin (r = -0.29). The percentage change in CD4+ T cells over a 1-year period correlated with HIV-1 RNA levels (r = -0.32, p = 0.03), however, stronger correlations were found for neopterin, beta(2)-microglobulin and sTNFR-75 (r = -0.51, r = -0.41, r = -0.32; p<0.01). No progression to AIDS or death was observed in individuals with baseline HIV-1 RNA levels below 20,000 copies/ml (10 of 31 and 15 of 37 individuals, respectively). A Cox's proportional hazard model to predict AIDS revealed that HIV-1 RNA, the change in CD4+ cells over a 1-year period and sTNFR-75 levels independently predict AIDS; the change in CD4+ cells, the absolute CD4+ T cell count and neopterin were jointly significant to predict death. All results were adjusted for nucleoside monotherapy. In conclusion, to improve the predictive power, quantitation of HIV-1 RNA as a 'natural history marker' may be supplemented by measurement of sTNFR-75 for 'early'-stage disease progression and neopterin for 'late'-stage disease progression.

AB Background: The Women and Infants Transmission Study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants. We used the 1994 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification system for HIV infection in children to describe HIV disease progression in 128 HIV-infected children, and examined maternal and infant characteristics associated with disease course.
   Methods: The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate probabilities of entry into CDC clinical classes A, B, and C (mild, moderate, and severe HIV disease); CDC immunologic stages 2 and 3; and death. Relative risks of progression for selected predictor events were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results: With a median 24 months of follow-up, the median ages at entry into clinical classes A, B and C were 5, 11, and 48 months, respectively. Increased risk of progression to class C was seen in infants who had: onset of class B events (p < .001); progression to immunologic stage 2 (p < .001) or 3 (p < .001); early culture positivity tin first 48 hours, p < .01; in first 7 days, p = .03); and early appearance (within the first 3 months of life) of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Reaching specific clinical or immunologic stages were strong predictors of progression to AIDS or death. Early onset of clinical signs (onset of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly less than or equal to 3 months of age), and early culture positivity (within the first 48 hours or within the first week of life); defined the infant with highest risk of disease progression.

ID JAPAN
AB By monitoring perturbations of the natural atmospheric electric potential gradient, it is possible to detect and track particle laden volcanic plumes. The perturbations are produced by electrical charge that resides on the solid particles and liquid droplets of the plume, and the ions within it. A network of potential gradient monitoring stations around a volcano can provide data on eruption time, magnitude, plume dispersion direction and areas of ashfall. Our laboratory experiments have produced electrically charged ash by fragmenting pumice. These results support the theory that charging is due to the magma fragmentation process and should therefore be ubiquitous in all particulate volcanic plumes.

ID MODEL
AB This paper describes residential development and location choice within a community subject to future natural hazards of uncertain severity. This is accomplished by constructing an equilibrium model of housing markets in which locations are differentiated by both risk of loss due to natural hazards and distance from a central business district. In this context, households trade-off location and risk amenities, allowing for the possibility that areas within the outer boundary of the community will be left undeveloped in equilibrium. General equilibrium comparative statics are derived in economies both with and without insurance. Emphasis is placed on describing the impact of variables such as population and income on the development of hazardous areas. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

DE Etna; volcanic eruptions; long-term forecasting model
ID EARTHQUAKES; RECURRENCE
AB Until now, the widely used predictive long-term hazard medals of the most intense natural phenomena do not yield predictions other than the mean return period. To achieve less uncertain estimates, an alternative model is proposed. The analysis of the eruptions of Etna from 1868 to 1993 shows that the time interval D-t between consecutive large eruptions is clearly random, whereas the total volume of tephra ejected during D-t is roughly constant. Taking into account the above evidence, the model yields significant long-term forecasts both of the time and of the intensity of future large eruptions. The large volume of tephra ejected by the volcano since the last intense eruption in 1980 allows the model to estimate that the next large eruption will not to take place soon.

AB Due to its geographical location, geology and topography, Turkey mainly undergoes three different types of natural disasters related to gravity flows. They are floods, landslides and snow avalanches.
   The heavy snow falls during winter pose the hazard of snow avalanches. According to statistics, 800 people were killed in snow avalanches during the period of 1960-1997. Within the program of the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-2000), an international cooperation has been initiated among SFISAR (Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research), CEMAGREF (Centre National du Machinisme Agricole du Genie Rural des Eaux at des Forets) and AFET (Turkish Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, General Directorate of Disaster Affairs). This three-year project started in 1994 as a development project on avalanche forecasting, mapping, zoning and paravalanche construction technologies. For the pilot project area, the Soganli Mountains located in north-eastern Turkey were chosen, covering an area of approximately 40 by 30 km. After training the Turkish engineers, the basic technologies in avalanche forecasting and avalanche mapping were transferred from Switzerland and France to Turkey with the necessary infrastructure. The difficulties faced in meteorological data collection with the help of local observers and the Limited data available caused some delay in avalanche forecasting. If automatic weather stations could take the place of manual work the realization of a prognosis would be quicker. At present, avalanche-hit houses are rebuilt in new disaster-free zones by AFET. With this project, the idea of using paravalanche structures for protection is promoted. The physico-sociological impacts of avalanche disasters, avalanche mapping and zoning of disaster areas on local people are also studied.

AB There is still no consensus on the natural history and optimal management of optic pathway gliomas (OPG) in children. In order to tackle optimal management issues, we need to clearly understand the prognostic and confounding factors affecting relapse of OPG. We propose the use of the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model in a retrospective study of childhood OPG of 69 children seen from 1977 to 1994. We have developed a comprehensive model capable of multivariate analyses and handling time-dependencies. Our studies showed that relapse-free survival improves with increasing age, the presence of neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), and chemotherapy and radiotherapy (p < 0.0005). Sex, tumor position and surgery do not significantly affect survival. Older children with NF1 have extremely good prognosis. We noted behavior that departs from the strictly proportional hazards model, but results were inconclusive.

AB The maximum likelihood estimation of earthquake hazard parameters has been made in the Himalayas and its surrounding areas on the basis of a procedure which utilizes data containing complete files of the most recent earthquakes. The entire earthquake catalogue used covers the period from 1900-1990. The maximum regional magnitude M-max, the activity rate of the seismic event lambda, the mean return period R of earthquakes with a certain lower magnitude M-max greater than or equal to m along with their probability of occurrence, as well as the parameter b of of Gutenberg Richter magnitude-frequency relationship, have been determined for six different seismic zones of the Himalayas and its vicinity. It is shown that in general the hazard is higher in the zone NEI and BAN than the other four zones. The high difference of the b parameter and the hazard level from zone to zone reflect the high seismotectonic complexity and crustal heterogeneity.

AB Relationships between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and hailfall activity in the Sydney area were investigated with the help of a newly compiled Natural Hazards Research Centre (NHRC) hailfall database. The original hail data, which contain a record of all hailstone sizes for the period 1791-1994, were stratified into the form of (monthly, seasonal) annual hailday sums for the period 1935-1994 and cross-correlated with the SOI values stratified accordingly. With the exception of a marginally significant value for the month of November (r = 0.26) no other significant simultaneous or lagged correlations were found between these two types of variables. A multifactor SOI was then developed as a possible indicator of the annual (June to May) hailstorm frequencies. The new three-factor SOI is composed of the sum of two SOI gradients (the differences between the October and June SOI values, and the November and February SOI values, respectively), minus the absolute value of the SOI average for the second half of the year. It is shown that high annual hailstorm activity tends to be associated with a high value of this index. High index values are generally reached during years marked by a rising SOI from June to November and a trend towards negative SOI values thereafter. It is suggested that this reversal of the relationship between the hail activity and the SOI can be attributed to similar changes observable in (low and high level) geopotential height anomalies over the area. The multifactor SOI leads to correlations of 0.6 (0.8) with the 1935-1994 (1985-1994) time series of annual hailday numbers. The three-factor index has more of a monitoring than a predictive quality (as it relies on the SOI values for the June to February period), whereas a subset index, consisting of the first and third component only, can have a predictive character. The latter partial index relies on the June to October data only and leads to nearly as high correlations with the annual hailday sums as the entire three-factor index (r = 0.4-0.8). The stepwise development of the multifactor SOI is based on a multiple categorisation of the annual (seasonal) hailday numbers into several broad SOI categories according to the magnitude of the concurrent SOI values. Further details about the characteristics of these indices and their association with hailfall activity are described. (C) 1998 Royal Meteorological Society.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL
AB The climate in northwestern Europe in the last 50 years appears to have undergone periods of marked extreme events such as windstorms, snowstorms and events of heavy rainfall, causing floods and erosion. In particular, the summers in the 1990s had Mediterranean-like fluctuations with warm spells, rainstorms of "double" intensity, flooding, and landslides in the mountains. If and how these extremes are connected with global warming due to an increasing greenhouse effect is an open question. However, we feel justified, both for theoretical and practical reasons, in making the following recommendations for future research: Continued observation and information on extreme erosional events and natural hazards are important in order to clarify their climatic links and for safer environmental management for the benefit of people who work or are tourists in the mountains and downstream areas. It is also necessary to improve our knowledge of the connections between local weather extremes and regional climatic trends, e.g. through reconstruction of the former frequency of events during periods of rising temperatures. Two kinds of erosional processes and natural hazards, which may increase in frequency during a climatic warming, are discussed: i) snowmelt-triggered floods and slushflows in spring; and ii) rainstorm-triggered floods and debris flows in summer and autumn.

AB Imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri) are the source of a potentially lethal environmental hazard in the southeastern United States. Because of their resistance to natural and chemical control, fire ants can overwhelm their environment, causing destruction of land and animals. Fire ants can also cause a variety of health problems in humans, ranging from simple stings to anaphylaxis and death. We present a case of a 30-year-old woman who died of anaphylaxis following multiple fire ant stings. At autopsy, multiple skin lesions characteristic of those produced by fire ant stings were present on her arm. Postmortem blood samples were positive for imported fire ant venom-specific IgE antibodies (5654 ng/ml) and tryptase (12 ng/ml). Deaths caused by imported fire ant stings are rare but are likely to become more common as the fire ant population expands. In this report, we review deaths due to fire ant stings, discuss postmortem laboratory findings, and stress the importance of recognizing the characteristic skin lesions produced by fire ants.

However, a careful nutritional and toxicological evaluation of these products is necessary. since algae show bioaccumulation properties towards heavy metals. In this frame, samples of commercial and natural Spirulina platensis of Cuban origin, have been characterized for their macromineral and trace elements content. Measurements have been carried out by INAA and ICP-AES employing standard reference materials. The use of two techniques allowed the determination of a wider spectrum of elements and in some cases, the cross-checking of the data obtained. The toxic heavy metals levels found in both products are such that they do not constitute, on the basis of the recommended daily doses a health hazard for consumers.

ID PHTHORIMAEA-OPERCULELLA ZELLER; POTATO TUBERMOTH; TUNISIA
AB A probabilistic approach of survival analysis based on the theory of competing risks was applied to the potato tuber moth Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) affecting tubers in Tunisian rustic stores. Exponential curve of death, i.e. constant force of mortality functions were used in a case study on a cohort time basis. The additive property of crude cause-specific forces of mortality is used to combine mortality factors, which permits to judge different control strategies. In an integrated pest management perspective, the effect of basic mortalities: i.e innate and dispersal related mortalities is recombined with native natural enemies. Thereafter, we calculate the force of additional comptatible control factors needed to reduce the proportion of infested tubers below an economically relevant level. Control strategies based on native natural enemies are shown to have variable effects which put farmers at economic risks. The general importance of integrating compatible control factors is recognized in the evaluation of virus applications. Based on risk analyses, Tunisian potato growers were recommended, in the case of standard initial infestations of five eggs per tuber, to use virus preparations at a higher dosage than the 0.0015 larval equivalent/kg as used in this study. Moreover, the study confirms the general importance of entering potatoes with low infestation levels into rustic shelters. This considerably decreases the risk of exceeding the economic threshold and make virus based control efficient even at low dosages. If the initial infestation considerably exceeds five eggs per tuber, the integration of a compatible control factor becomes more difficult. Nevertheless, even in absence of additional control factors the infestation of tubers does not exceed 50%. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A classical twin study was performed to assess the extent to which genetic factors explain individual differences in age at menopause and (indications for) hysterectomy. It was further examined whether a genetic effect on the timing of the menopause was mediated through a genetic effect on age at menarche. The subjects were 275 monozygotic and 353 dizygotic female twin pairs. Maximum likelihood model fitting was used to estimate genetic and environmental variance components, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to account for censored data, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust for potential confounders. A model specifying additive genetic and unique environmental factors showed the best fit to the data, yielding a heritability (h(2)) for age at menopause of 63%. The significance of the genetic effect was confirmed by the survival analysis and was not affected by adjustment for confounders. Both early and late menopause were found to be significantly influenced by genetic factors. Hysterectomy also showed considerable heritability (h(2) = 59%), as did its two main indications: fibroids (h(2) = 69%) and menorrhagia (h(2) = 55%). The genetic contribution to the variance in age at menarche was estimated to be 45%, with the majority (37%) being due to dominant genetic effects. No correlation was found between age at menopause and age at menarche, suggesting different genetic mechanisms. This study provides convincing evidence for the importance of genetic factors in determining natural and surgical menopause. Understanding how genes control the timing of menopause and exploring whether these genes are indirectly associated with disease are important areas for future study.

AB After a brief review of the previous studies and a description of the geographical setting of the Changjiang River, the Changjiang River delta, and the Changjiang River estuary, this paper first summarizes the geological framework in which the recent vertical tectonic movement is emphasized because of its close connection with relative sea level changes and earthquakes. A systematic description of the stratigraphy reveals the local geologic history. Sedimentary sequences, facies and structures since the Holocene are next briefly reviewed. The historical delta and coast development is examined, with special reference to the coastal response to sediment supply. Recent achievements on the physical and biological processes in estuarine and coastal waters are presented. These processes are found to greatly influence the temporal and spatial variation of water salinity, suspended sediment concentration, sedimentation rate, and primary productivity. The interaction of natural processes with socioeconomic development is discussed in detail, with an emphasis on the major problems of estuarine freshwater resources and the impact of water diversion, harbors and navigation channels, land shortage and the impact of land reclamation, subsiding ground surface, rising sea level and flood hazards. Finally, the probable delta development in the coming decades in response to several large scale engineering works is discussed, such as the Three-Gorges Dam, the planned water transfer to North China, and the Deep Water Navigation Channel.

AB Background/Aims/Methods: The aim of this study was to elucidate the rate of development to cirrhosis and the rate of appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic viral hepatitis and to assess the risk factors for the development of disease in 2215 consecutive patients with viral hepatitis who were prospectively studied for a median observation period of 4.1 years.
   Results: The rates of development to cirrhosis were 7.6%, 21.7%, and 32.2%, at the 5th, 10th, and 15th year, respectively, The carcinogenesis rates were 3.4%, 10.5%, and 22.4% at the 5th, 10th, and 15th year, respectively The appearance rates of cancer in 645 patients with only hepatitis B surface antigen and in 1500 patients with only anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies were 2.1% and 4.8% at the 5th year, 4.9% and 13.6% at the 10th year, and 18.8% and 26.0% at the 15th year, respectively, The proportional hazard model identified that the amount of alcohol intake (p=0.0002) and the indocyanine green retention rate (p= 0.022) were independently associated with carcinogenesis in hepatitis type B; and stage of hepatitis (p<0.0001), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (p=0,0046), history of blood transfusion (p=0.0093), albumin (p=0.012), and amount of alcohol intake (p=0.031) were independently associated with the carcinogenesis rate in hepatitis type C, Although the severity of portal fibrosis was closely correlated with the future disease development and carcinogenesis in chronic hepatitis C, it was not a good predictor in chronic hepatitis B.
   Conclusion: These epidemiological results suggest that there are some differences in the activity and modes of disease progression and cancer promotion between hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis C virus infection.

AB For the Cox proportional hazards model, the goodness-of-fit problem of testing whether the baseline hazard rate function lambda(.) equals some specified hazard rate function lambda(0)(.) in the presence of incomplete data is considered. Extending Neyman's idea, the goodness-of-fit tests are score tests obtained by embedding lambda(.) in a larger family of hazard rate functions developed through smooth and possibly random transformations of lambda(0)(.) But whereas their smooth alternatives were formulated through the density function, my formulation is through the hazard rate function, which is more natural in failure time models where model specification is now done through hazard rates. Furthermore, my smooth alternatives are allowed to be data driven or dynamic. Through this machinery, classes of omnibus, as well as directional goodness-of-fit tests are obtained. Moreover, this machinery provides a theoretically sound method for combining varied directional goodness-of-fit tests into omnibus tests. Some of the resulting tests are specialized to the randomly censored model. Finite and asymptotic properties of the resulting tests are presented. The asymptotic results shed light into properties of generalized residuals typically used in model validation and diagnostics. The theoretical results indicate the adjustments that need to be made to properly use these residuals for goodness of fit and model validation. Two medical datasets are reanalyzed using the proposed procedures.

DE flood management; flood risk; public involvement; public perception
AB The understanding of how people evaluate and respond to natural hazards in an urban area, and how this knowledge can be integrated in the planning and management process, are becoming very important elements of a comprehensive and participatory approach to flood hazard management. Such an approach demands a clear comprehension of the processes of the risks perception, causal attribution, possible solutions for the problem and patterns of behaviour developed during hazard situations. The willingness of the public to participate in flood management, and the attitudes to previous initiatives also need to be addressed. The provision of structural flood defences can have a major impact on the environment and there has been an expression of concern by many members of the public for the degradation of river corridors. In this context, it is becoming a commonly accepted practice by central or local governments to submit flood management plans to public discussion. Appropriate techniques for interfacing with the public are necessary to support this upsurge of public involvement. This paper presents results from research on public perception of floods, flood management and participatory initiatives in Setubal, Portugal. An extensive interview programme was undertaken with residents and shopkeepers - with and without flood experience, professionals responsible for dealing with flood control problems and local authorities responsible for decision-making on flood management. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations for flood hazard management policy making and processes.

FX EUROflood research project was made possible with the support of the
   European Commission. Funding for this research project was provided by
   the EC under the Climatology and Natural Hazards component of the
   Environment Research Programme. The Portuguese National Board for
   Science and Technology (JNICT), also played a very crucial role at an
   early stage of this research project. Prof. Edmund Penning-Rowsel must
   be acknowledged as coordinator of EUROflood. Middlesex University, IST,
   Delft Hydraulics, Braschel + Schmitz, CERGRENE, LNEC, Catania
   University, and Polytechnic University of Catalunya were the
   organisations participating in the project, which provided interesting
   exchange of views and scientific contributions. Research work in
   Portugal was done with the support of JNICT, CNIG, ISA and LNEC. Special
   acknowledgement are due to Prof. Evan Vlachos, who played a crucial role
   in the inception phase of this research work, and to Dr. Luis Soczka
   that provided guidance in the public perception studies and in the
   structuring of the questionnaire.

AB In the past decade, numerous sights across North America have been found which contain abnormal levels of deformed amphibians. This deformation was not limited to species, geography, or climate and spanned a wide range of phenotypes. This report begins to explain these findings by examining the effects of pesticide degradation in early amphibian development through directly exposing Xenopus laevis embryos to trace levels of synthetically prepared degradates. This method specifically determines the risk posed by each individual chemical resulting from the natural fate of the host pesticide. Through this approach, we find that while the common insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, poses minimal developmental determent, products of its reaction with sunlight, water, and microorganisms dramatically interfere with normal amphibian development. The addition of 1 mu L/L of several of S-methoprene's degradates to the environment of developing embryos resulted in juveniles with deformation similar to that found naturally. Current developmental assessments examine only the risk posed by host pesticides. This study now suggest that the simple examination of the these materials is not sufficient, but now forward the need for critically examining the temporal relation between both development and chemical degradation.

AB The design of environmentally sound liquid waste containment structures has become a crucial task in engineering applications due to ever increasing groundwater contamination from such sites. Construction of such structures usually requires a bottom liner of low hydraulic conductivity as part of the design. In order to reduce the hazards associated with liquid wastes including landfill leachate, bentonite-amended natural zeolite is proposed as an alternative to conventional earthen liners. Among many contaminants associated with liquid wastes, heavy metals are the most dangerous ones. This paper deals with determining the ability of natural zeolite to remove heavy metals from aqueous waste. For this purpose, crushed natural zeolite (clinoptinolite) is amended with commercial powdered bentonite to yield a soil mixture low in permeability and high in ion-exchange capacity. Leachate from a conventional landfill is used as the percolation fluid. Concentrations of certain heavy metals in the effluent fluid percolated through the bentonite-zeolite mixture are compared with that of initial leachate. The conclusion is reached that certain metals are efficiently removed from the influent solution by the soil matrix whereas some ions do not show significant reduction in concentration. This is attributed to high hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite-zeolite mixture.

AB This paper presents empirical results on moral hazard in demand for medical care, using a longitudinal dataset on 4578 individuals followed during two years. The dataset contains two subgroups, one for which a copayment rate of 10% for physician visits was introduced in 1994, and an other for which no change occurred during the period of the study. This enables us to use these data as coming from a controlled natural experiment. We test if the number of visits per agent was modified by this copayment rate. The data reject the hypothesis for office visits, but do not for home visits. This suggests that there is moral hazard in demand for some physician services, but also that when non-monetary costs are important, small changes in monetary price may not induce any major change in behavior (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB An association has been reported between nuclear p53 protein expression in tumour cells and a poor outcome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study we investigated the prognostic significance of nuclear p53 protein expression in CRC liver metastases after curative hepatic resection. The study population consisted of 69 consecutive patients who underwent curative hepatic resection for metastases from CRC at our Institution between February 1987 and October 1993. Immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein was evaluated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of CRC liver metastases using the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) D01 and Pab 1801. The Cox proportional hazards model was used in forward stepwise regression to assess the relative influence of different prognostic factors. Forty-four (63.8%) CRC liver metastases were p53-positive. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with p53-positive metastases had a median survival of 27 months versus 93 months for patients with p53-negative metastases (P<0.01). The 3 and 5 year survival rates were 31.5 and 21.0% in patients with p53-positive metastases and 71.8 and 53.1% in patients with p53-negative metastases. At multivariate analysis p53 protein status was the single best predictor of survival (P=0.0079); the odds ratio of death among patients with p53-positive tumours was 2.53. Nuclear p53 protein expression in hepatic metastases from CRC is an independent prognostic factor of survival following liver resection. These findings may be of clinical importance in the selection of patients more likely to benefit from liver resection and could be used as criteria for stratification in trials on adjuvant therapy.

ID NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; EGYPT
AB The concentration of radioactive Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in building and ceramic materials of Bangladesh was investigated by gamma-spectrometry with two HPGe detectors. Radium equivalent activities, representative level index values, criterion formula, emanation coefficients and Rn-222 mass exhalation rates were estimated for the radiation hazard of the natural radioactivity in the materials. The activity concentrations of the natural radionuclides, radium equivalent activities, emanation coefficients and Rn-222 mass exhalation rates are compared with the corresponding values for building and ceramic materials of different countries. The radium equivalent activities in the samples varied between 30.9 (mosaic stone) and 328.0 Bq.kg(-1) (gypsum). The emanation coefficient of the materials ranged from 7.83 (cement) to 33.0% (soil) and the Rn-222 mass exhalation rate ranged from 2.31 (stone chips) to 118.0 mu Bq.kg(-1).s(-1) (gypsum).

ID HEALTH; HYSTERECTOMY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ISSUES; LIFE
AB Population aging coupled with heightened consumerism among those using the health care system have increased public and research interest in menopause. Despite these trends, we know little about the process of menstrual cessation. This paper reviews previous claims regarding secular trends in menopausal age by considering how menstrual cessations differ by type: (1) that due to surgical intervention such as hysterectomy, and (2) that due to "natural" (non-surgical) menopause. Analyses of menopause that exclude hysterectomized women are flawed, because such women constitute a high proportion of American women at midlife. Competing risk survival analysis techniques are applied to model the shape of the underlying hazards for reproductive organ surgery versus "natural" menopause among 3506 midlife women from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. Weibull models are used to evaluate effects of a variety of possible correlates (including education, mental ability, occupation, family background, fertility experience, smoking behavior and hormone therapy). While socioeconomic parameters do contribute to observed differences in age at menstrual cessation, these factors operate through more proximate health-related behaviors (such as smoking in the case of natural menopause and fertility for surgical menopause).

AB Transforming natural units of laboratory markers of HIV disease may improve their ability to predict clinical outcomes. The authors examined this issue within a prospective study of 394 patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study !(SHCS) between 1991 and 1993. Baseline predictors included CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell counts, HIV RNA levels, beta(2)-microglobulin, and age. Outcomes were death and clinical progression. A range of power transformations was applied to each predictor, and the goodness-of-fit of the corresponding proportional hazards models was assessed. The prognostic value of all laboratory variables could be improved on by power transformations. To predict either outcome variable, the "best" transformation of HIV RNA copies and CD8(+) cell counts was the logarithm; for beta(2)-microglobulin, it was power -2. For CD4(+) cell counts, the best transformation depended on the outcome variable: it was power 0.2 when predicting survival, and power 0.4 when predicting clinical progression. The single best predictor variable was the ratio of HIV RNA copies per CD4(+) cell, for both death (logarithmic transformation) and clinical progression (power -0.1 transformation). Natural units of laboratory variables are not optimal for the prediction of clinical events in HIV-infected patients. Which transformation is best depends on the predictor under consideration.

AB The Volvi basin (northern Greece) is a 5-km-wide graben of Neogene age. It has been chosen by European Union (Directorate General XII for Science, Research and Development in Climatology and Natural Hazards) as a test site (EURO-SEISTEST) for studying site effects in one of Europe's most seismic active areas. The site is located in the epicentral area of the 1978, Ms = 6.5, earthquake that struck the city of Thessaloniki. The geometry, velocity, and stratigraphy of the basin were not well known. Consequently, a number of geophysical and geotechnical studies were performed to determine the 2D geometry and the dynamic characteristics (Vp, Vs, Qs) of the valley. Investigations included 78 refraction tests, 20 surface-wave inversions, and 8 borehole seismic tests as well as geotechnical tests. This article presents the methodology used for the geophysical investigation and the results. In its center, the graben depth reaches 190 m, and at least four normal faults have been located along the section. The overall graben structure and the fault locations have been confirmed by the records of a shot generated at one edge of the valley and by the measurements of a local earthquake. Wave propagation appears to be strongly influenced by the thickness of the sediments, which in turn is controlled by fault displacements. Simple 2D modeling of the basin response was performed, and the results are in good agreement with weak-motion data, confirming the validity of the seismic structure inferred from seismic prospecting.

TI Fate and risk evaluation of persistent organic contaminants and related

ID ENVIRONMENTAL FATE; SEDIMENT; QUALITY
AB The Environment Protection Department of Hong Kong has a monitoring program for persistent organic contaminants in sediments of Victoria Harbour, the main harbour of Hong Kong. A fugacity model has been used, based on this sedimentary data, to estimate inputs to the system (probably from sewage, stormwater and industrial discharges) as well as the fate of the contaminants, particularly in terms of the aqueous and biotic concentrations. The risk of deleterious effects on the natural marine system, as well as on the consumers of seafood from the system, was carried out using the estimated aqueous and biotic concentrations together with accepted environmental quality guidelines. The result of our analysis indicated that the chlorohydrocarbons, PCBs (as Aroclor 1254) total DDT and total HCH pose a significant risk, and probably have caused damage to the marine ecosystem as well as posing a hazard to seafood consumers. Much higher concentrations of the less toxic total alkanes, nonaromatic hydrocarbons, linear alkyl benzenes and the compounds giving a unresolved complex mixture (UCM) cannot be evaluated due to a lack of environmental guidelines and the complexity of these substances. However, it is probable that these substances add adverse effects to those due to the other contaminants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   DIARRHEA
AB Next to bacteria microbial hazards in food comprise mycotoxin-producing moulds, protozoae, viruses and prions. Epidemiological aspects are mentioned which are essential for the pathogenesis of foodborne diseases caused by these agents. Compared with chemical and physical hazards the occurrence or emergence of microbiological hazards depends on a variety of factors and influences during food production and processing that well structured hygiene and food safety management concepts respectively are essential.
   In particular this paper refers to the minimal infective dose for man, the factors influencing growth of bacteria in food and to predictive microbiology. The application of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) concept for microbial hazards is mentioned with particular emphasis on the importance of monitoring.
   Due to the particular significance of the faeco-oral transmission route for many bacterial foodborne diseases basic hygiene measures assume a decisive importance in food safety management. The HACCP system is based upon such measures and should only be viewed as part of an efficient total hygiene concept in food companies. The example of drinking milk pasteurization illustrates that the introduction of the HACCP system does not constitute a fundamentally new development and that it should rather be viewed as a renaissance of old principles of natural science and hygiene.

TI Natural resource management in mitigating climate impacts: the example

LA English

ID WETLANDS
AB The risk that tropical storm occurrence may alter as a result of global warming presents coastal managers, particularly in vulnerable areas, with a serious challenge. Many countries are hard-pressed to protect their coastal resources against present-day hazards, let alone any increased threat in the future. Moreover, the threat posed by climate change is uncertain making the increased costs of protection difficult to justify. Here, we examine one management strategy, based on the rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem, which may provide a dual, "win-win" benefit in improving the livelihood of local resource users as well as enhancing sea defences. The strategy,therefore,represent a precautionary approach to climate impact mitigation. This paper quantifies the economic benefits of mangrove rehabilitation undertaken, inter alia, to enhance sea defence systems in three coastal Districts of northern Vietnam. The results of the analysis show that mangrove rehabilitation can be desirable from an economic perspective based solely on the direct use benefits by local communities. Such activities have even higher benefit cost ratios with the inclusion of the indirect benefits resulting from the avoided maintenance cost for the sea dike system which the mangrove stands protect from coastal storm surges.

AB Successful immunosuppression withdrawal should benefit the natural history of organ transplantation patients, To identify the clinical hazards of removing drug treatment and possible characteristics that predict a favorable outcome in long-term liver recipients, immunosuppression was withdrawn completely and the clinicopathological outcome documented in 18 liver recipients. Indication for transplantation, HLA matching, early rejection history, and presence of microchimerism were examined as predictors of outcome, Chimerism was determined by polymerase chain reaction-based examination for donor-specific HLA-DRB1 alleles and Y-gene-specific nucleotide sequences. At 3 years, 5 patients (28%) remained completely off immunosuppression; 12 patients (67%) experienced histological graft changes: acute rejection in 4, portal tract inflammation/ hepatitis in 7, and necrosis in 1, Hepatitis B or C viral infections did not account for the nonrejection patterns, Unmasking of systemic disorders occurred. Chimerism, demonstrated in 7 patients (39%), with skin the optimal tissue, was not associated with tolerance. Parameters associated with successful drug withdrawal were transplantation for non-immune-mediated liver disorders, fewer donor-recipient HLA A, B, and DR mismatches, and a low incidence of early rejection, Immunosuppression withdrawal is a feasible option in a proportion of selected liver recipients, but identification of tolerant patients remains imprecise.

ID PROPERTY
AB This paper describes a new sensor and a new method to measure the thermal conductivity of many fluids. The principal advantage of the device is self compensation against temperature brought about by an appropriate choice of the materials, Moreover, because the sensor uses both the Peltier and Seebeck effects, measurements can be carried out with accuracy according to an average temperature increase of the device lower than SK, Operation of the device brings about a very low Joule power (5 mW), A coherent design rationale is formulated and the various stages in the technical development of the sensor are delineated. Several cases are discussed with a view to increasing the applicability of the method, Notable applications include thermal conductivity gauges for measuring pressures in high-vacuum systems, tank gauging for liquids featuring fire hazards, and low velocity measurements occurring in natural convection mechanisms. It is expected that the versatility of the device will result in a nide number of industrial applications.

AB This paper describes the occurrence of human pathogenic Vibrio spp. and Salmonella in aquaculture, Vibrio species are natural inhabitants of marine aquatic environments in both temperate and tropical regions, with most human infections acquired by exposure to such environments or to foods derived from them. There appears to be a positive correlation between water temperature and the number of human pathogenic vibrios isolated as well as the number of reported infections. However, the occurrence of vibrios does not correlate with traditionally used bacterial indicator organisms of faecal pollution, and their presence in aquaculture is to be expected and cannot be controlled by water quality control measures such as wastewater treatment. Among more than 12 Vibrio spp. known to be associated with human disease, V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus are the most important causes of gastrointestinal diseases. Only V. cholerae serotypes O1 and O139, which are rarely found in the environment where aquaculture is practised, cause the disease cholera. Although fish and shellfish may be vehicles of cholera transmission, most episodes are identified as a single or a cluster of cases after consumption of raw seafood. Cholera cases caused by the consumption of commercial imported seafood products have to the author's knowledge not been reported. Seafood products should not contain strains of V. cholerae O1 and O139. However, non-O1 non-O139 strains, which are normally present in non-faecal polluted aquaculture environments, have a low pathogenic potential, and their presence in fish products seems only to constitute a minor health hazard. Accordingly, fresh and frozen fish products containing V. cholerae non-O1 non-O139 should not be rejected for human consumption. V. parahaemolyticus is an important cause of gastrointestinal disease, most often after the consumption of seafood. Several haemolysins are important virulence factors, with environmental strains often showing a lower virulence than clinical strains. V. vulnificus may, mainly among immunocompromised individuals, cause serious wound infections and primary septicaemia after ingestion of raw seafood, especially oysters, or contact with seawater. However, confirmed human cases of septicaemic or gastrointestinal disease caused by V. vulnificus after consumption of fish have not been reported, and evidence of V. vulnificus as a cause of gastroenteritis has not been provided. Based on data mainly from temperate regions, Salmonella is generally not recognized as being part of the normal microflora in aquaculture environments, and their presence in seafood is therefore seen as a sign of poor standards of process hygiene and sanitation. Accordingly, most countries will not accept Salmonella in any seafood product. Although some studies suggest that Salmonella may be ubiquitous in tropical aquaculture environments, further studies are needed to confirm this. Modern gene-based typing techniques could provide important information about possible trans-mission of Salmonella strains from the aquaculture environment to processing facilities and the final products. Although Salmonella is one of the most important causes of human gastrointestinal disease world-wide, surveillances of food-borne outbreaks associated with the consumption of fish showed that Salmonella species are rarely implicated in gastrointestinal disease.

TI Case history and hazard analysis of two lake-damming landslides in the
   Himalayas
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB In investigating the hazard and case history of natural dams in the Himalayas, two sites of landslides and their former dammed lakes in the hinterland were visited between May 1994 and October 1995 and analysed from the geomorphological, geotechnical, geohydrological, tectonic, sedimentary and climatic points of view. One of the examples studied, the landslide in the valley of Birahi Ganga (Northern India), is one of the most impressive examples of recent hazards in alpinotype high mountain regions. This study was complemented by a study of the Ghatta Khola landslide (Western Nepal). In both cases, lithotectonic and climatic conditions led to the destabilisation and failure of carbonate bedrock. The occurrence of lakes, dammed over long periods behind the barriers, is of great importance, because after the sometimes fatal landslide event itself, one is confronted and has to cope with a secondary natural hazard, the possibility of a major flood due to the failure of the dam. That is why the preparatory causal factors of the origin of the two lakes (by damming up the river due to the landslide) and their stepwise disappearance (by secondary landslides within the barrier and sedimentation into the basin) were additionally focused upon. It is shown that due to very special circumstances (availability of sediments, heavy rainfall) in the Himalayas there is a progressive decrease in the potential hazard to the landscape and to human beings lower down the main valleys over a period of only a few decades.

AB To explore the natural history of critically ill patients with acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis, we evaluated 256 patients enrolled in the placebo arm of a randomized clinical trial. Death and the composite outcome, death or the provision of dialysis, were determined with follow-up to 60 d. The relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) associated with routinely available demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were estimated using proportional hazards regression. Ninety-three (36%) deaths were documented: an additional 52 (20%) patients who survived received dialysis. Predictors of mortality included male gender (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.36), oliguria (RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.43 to 3.55), mechanical ventilation (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.93), acute myocardial infarction (RR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.85 to 5.31), acute stroke or seizure (RR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.56 to 6.06), chronic immunosuppression (RR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.16 to 4.88), hyperbilirubinemia (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.08 per 1 mg/dl increase in total bilirubin), and metabolic acidosis (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.99 per 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate concentration). Predictors of death or the provision of dialysis were oliguria (RR, 5.95; 95% CI, 3.96 to 8.95), mechanical ventilation (RR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.21), acute myocardial infarction (RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.07), arrhythmia (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.19), and hypoalbuminemia (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.74 per 1 g/dl increase in serum albumin concentration). Neither mortality nor the provision of dialysis was related to patient age. These observations can be used to estimate risk early in the course of acute tubular necrosis. Furthermore, these and related models may be used to adjust for case-mix variation in quality improvement efforts, and to objectively stratify patients in future intervention trials aimed at favorably altering the course of hospital-acquired acute renal failure.

AB Hepatic resection remains the only potentially curative treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, This retrospective review study was undertaken in an attempt to identify factors that influence patient survival following hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. From January 1978 to December 1993, a total of 301 patients underwent a total of 345 planned hepatic resections for metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 245 patients had one resection, 44 had two resections, and 12 had three resections. For all patients the overall median survival was 20.6 months, operative mortality was 1.1%, and overall morbidity was 17.2%. Average hospital stay was 9 days. Statistical analysis included univariate analysis using log rank comparisons, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression. The statistically significant factors that influenced survival mere distribution of liver metastases, unilobar versus bilobar (p = 0.0001), resected versus nonresected (p < 0.0001), and tumor-free surgical margins versus positive margins (p = 0.001). Surprisingly, the disease-free interval and the original stage of the primary tumor did not predict survival (p = not significant). Other factors that had no influence on survival were type of resection, size and number of liver metastases, ABO blood group, and the number of perioperative blood transfusions. For those patients who underwent resection of unilobar metastases with tumor-free margins, the 5-year survival rate was 29% with a median survival of 35 months and eight survivors > 7 years. In addition, one patient with bilobar disease had survival > 7 years and five patients who had resection of hepatic metastases and extrahepatic cancer simultaneously had survival > 3 years. Our data support the concept that patients with unilobar metastatic disease who undergo surgical resection with tumor-free surgical margins can be afforded a significant opportunity at long-term survival with acceptable morbidity, mortality, and hospital stay. Also, certain patients with bilobar or extrahepatic disease (or both) who undergo complete resection can enjoy a long-term survival. In these subgroups of patients resection should be considered on an individual basis.

AB Principal components analysis (PCA), ratioing, image differencing and intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transformation have been widely used in monitoring various natural resources and environmental hazards. In our study, the temporal behaviour of salt-affected soils in the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains of Uttar Pradesh has been studied using Landsat MSS data for 1975 and 1992. Apart from routine digital classification of temporal MSS data using Guassian maximum likelihood algorithm, PCA, image differencing, and ratioing were also evaluated for their potential in bringing out temporal changes in salt-affected soils, if any. The results indicate that the third principle component, image differencing, and ratioing of the first two MSS bands for two periods have brought out substantial information associated with the temporal behaviour of salt-affected soils.

AB Contaminated groundwater poses a significant health hazard and may also impact wildlife such as amphibians when it surfaces. Using FETAX (Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus), the developmental toxicity of ground and surface water samples near a closed municipal landfill at Norman, OK, were evaluated. The groundwater samples were taken from a network of wells in a shallow, unconfined aquifer downgradient from the landfill. Surface water samples were obtained from a pond and small stream adjacent to the landfill. Surface water samples from a reference site in similar habitat were also analyzed. Groundwater samples were highly toxic in the area near the landfill, indicating a plume of toxicants. Surface water samples from the landfill site demonstrated elevated developmental toxicity. This toxicity was temporally variable and was significantly correlated with weather conditions during the 3 days prior to sampling. Mortality was negatively correlated with cumulative rain and relative humidity. Mortality was positively correlated with solar radiation and net radiation. No significant correlations were observed between mortality and weather parameters for days 4-7 preceding sampling. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Ras-Mohammed National Park, on the southern tip of Sinai peninsula, is a valuable tourist resource that should be carefully conserved. It has been recently threatened by numerous anthropogenic activities, including oil spills from tankers passing through the Gulf of Suez. The objective of this paper is to carry out an environmental sensitivity analysis of this coastal environment, and to derive an environmental sensitivity index map of the area. Integration of remote sensing and GIS techniques has proved a powerful tool for analyses of the environmental sensitivity for potential oil spills. In this work, SPOT-XS images were used to derive information about various resources of the area, especially the shallow submarine coral reef communities. Topographic and field sur?rey data were combined to produce the required sensitivity map. Ten major natural classes, along the shoreline and foreshore resources and habitats, were identified and analyzed. Their environmental sensitivity to potential oil spill were rated from low to high. The lowest sensitivity was assigned to the sea cliff and the highest to shallow coral reefs. Using GIS functions and analyses, it was possible to produce land use/land cover; shoreline sensitivity; foreshore sensitivity and critical natural resources maps. This information was used to determine protection priority, to propose access and protection planing, and to derive an environmental sensitivity index map of Ras-Mohammed.

AB Aquacultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) fillets were inoculated with the psychrotrophic pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Aeromonas hydrophila: cell populations were monitored during refrigerated storage at 2 to 4 degrees C. Fillets of both species were placed individually in sterile plastic bags and inoculated with cell suspensions (10(4.7) CFU/100 g of fish) of either A. hydrophila or L. monocytogenes or of both A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes, for a total of three treatments for each species of fish. Each inoculum and fillet were mixed to ensure uniform distribution and then stored at 2 to 4 degrees C. A. hydrophila, L. monocytogenes, and aerobic cell populations were determined on days 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 15. Individually inoculated A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes grew on catfish and trout fillets during the 15-day study. There was no inhibition of either pathogen by the natural flora on the fillets. Both psychrotrophic pathogens grew equally well in catfish and trout fillets inoculated with a combination of A. hydrophila and L. monocytogenes. In all three treatments, the counts of the psychrotrophic pathogens were lower than the aerobic plate counts. The growth of the psychrotrophic pathogens L. monocytogenes and/or A. hydrophila during refrigerated storage on aquacultured fish fillets could increase the food hazard risk, particularly where there is a possibility of cross-contamination with ready-to-eat food products.

DE internet; natural hazards; coursework
AB Use of the Internet is proliferating rapidly, with mounting speculation as to the practical applications for teaching in higher (and other sectors of) education, yet few published or evaluated case studies are available. This paper explores the use of Internet sources on geography courses. For various academic, logistic and philosophical reasons that are discussed, students were not given full access to the Internet, but were exposed to a variety of current Internet-sourced material downloaded onto a network fileserver, and encouraged to communicate internally and externally using electronic mail. This procedure maintained some of the vitality and stimulation of open access to the Internet, whilst providing some control over potential dangers inherent in this untested teaching medium. Evaluations of the student coursework performance on, and perception of, courses involving the Internet indicate no significant impairment in either during the first staging of the course, but substantial improvement in both, relative to similar modules running concurrently, during the second year of operation. We suggest that controlled use of the Internet provides both lecturer and student with practical exposure to this medium with low academic risk and minimal costs, which may lead to enhanced learning.

TI Rockfall hazard evaluation using probabilistic keyblock analysis
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Gravity-driven rock falls account for a large proportion of all fatalities and injuries in underground mines. Potentially unstable blocks of rock are found In the hanging wall of excavations, which may be delineated by natural joints or stress fractures. These blocks, referred to as keyblocks, will fail if their weight exceeds the support capacity or if they are located between support units. This paper describes a computer program which simulates blocks in the hanging wall of an excavation based on measured properties of fractures and joints. Keyblocks are identified and placed at random locations in a predefined excavation. The keyblocks are tested against the support to determine whether they fail the support, drop out between the support or are stable. By repeating the procedure several thousand times, statistics of the probability of failure of the keyblocks are obtained. This approach allows the relative hazard associated with different types of support or excavation orientations to be obtained. It is concluded that a probabilistic approach is suitable for the evaluation of supports effectiveness in situations where large numbers of discontinuities or stress fractures are exposed in excavations.

AB In this paper the powder snow avalanche is considered as a two-phase flow (air and snow particles). The equations governing this flow are the fluid mechanics conservation laws. The mass and the momentum conservation are considered for each phase. The interaction between the two phases takes into account the drag force between the particle and the air. Owing to high turbulence in the powder flow, a closure model was used based on a modified k - epsilon model in order to take into account the reduction of turbulence energy by the particles. The dense avalanche is modeled using the shallow water equations. The formation and the development of the powder avalanche is modeled using a mass and momentum exchanges between the powder flow and the dense flow. The flow area is digitized horizontally and vertically using a finite elements mesh. The numerical scheme is obtained by integrating the equations on each cell. The model thus built was calibrated using laboratory measurements of density current carried out in a flume. The model was successfully applied to reproduce many avalanches observed in France. At the end of this paper, an application of this model to an engineering case study is presented. It concerns the Uzengili path where an avalanche occurred in 1993. In this paper we use the integrated dense/powder avalanche model to define the effect of a powder avalanche flow in this path. Different simulations allow display of maps of the exposed zones for different available snow depths in the starting zone. The results were mapped in terms of dynamic pressure field and recommendations are proposed to the local authorities.

   LINES
AB The molecular bases for species barriers to lentiviral replication are not well understood, but are of interest for explaining lentiviral pathogenesis, devising therapeutic strategies, and adapting lentiviruses to gene therapy. HIV-l-based lentiviral vectors efficiently transduce nondividing cells', but present complex safety concerns(2). Nonprimate (ungulate or feline) lentiviruses might provide safer alternatives, but these viruses display highly restricted tropisms, and their potential for adaptation as replication-defective vectors capable of transducing human cells is unknown. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) does not infect humans or other non-Felidae despite prevalent natural exposure. Although long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed FIV expression was found to be negligible in human cells, promoter substitution enabled an env-deleted, three-plasmid, human cell-FIV lentiviral vector system to express high levels of FIV proteins and FIV vectors in human cells, thus bypassing the hazards of feline vector producer cells. Pseudotyped FIV vectors efficiently transduced dividing, growth-arrested, and postmitotic human targets. The experiments delineate mechanisms involved in species-restricted replication of this lentivirus and show that human cells support both productive- and infective-phase mechanisms of the FIV life cycle needed for efficient lentiviral vector transduction. Nonprimate lentiviral vectors may offer safety advantages, and FIV vectors provide unique experimental opportunities.

AB Objective: This study aimed to determine whether clinical tests of ocular function and macular appearance independently can help to predict which patients with unilateral neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will have a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) develop in their fellow eye.
   Design: The study design was a prospective cohort study.
   Participants: One hundred twenty-seven patients with unilateral neovascular AMD observed for up to 4.5 years participated.
   Intervention: Functional measurements included visual acuity, macular visual field, glare recovery time, and foveal electroretinogram amplitude and implicit time.
   Main Outcome Measure: The age-adjusted proportion of patients having a CNVM develop over follow-up assessed by the Cox proportional hazards model with stepwise selection was measured,
   Results: On average, 8.8% of patients had a CNVM develop each year. Independent risk factors for the fellow eye were its glare recovery time in minutes (relative risk = 1.30, confidence interval = 1.10-1.54, P = 0.003) and its extent of visible macular abnormalities on a four-point scale (relative risk = 1.62, confidence interval = 1.06-2.59, P = 0.03). Of the fellow eyes that converted, the interval to have a CNVM develop was inversely related to the foveal electroretinogram implicit time.
   Conclusions: A slower recovery from glare and more extensive funduscopic changes appear to be independent risk factors for the development of a CNVM in the fellow eyes of patients with unilateral neovascular AMD. A slower foveal electroretinogram implicit time may be a sign of early stage CNVM development, perhaps because of outer retinal ischemia. These results have clinical management implications, particularly for those patients at high risk of having a potentially treatable form of AMD develop.

TI Discarded tire recycling practices in the United States, Japan and Korea
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
LA English
DT Article
ID PYROLYSIS
AB Discarded tires have been a disposal problem and continue to accumulate throughout the world today. In the United States, in particular, over 279 million discarded tires are being added to an estimated 2 billion tires currently stockpiled around the country. The stockpiled tires provide breeding sites for mosquitoes which can spread diseases and often constitute fire hazards. Utilization of discarded tires would minimize environmental impact and maximize conservation of natural resources. Current practice includes retreading, recycling as crumb rubber, and combustion for thermal energy. A literature review was made to compare the discarded tire recycling practices in the United States, Japan and Korea. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate the extent to which changes in US labour market policy in the 1980s may have contributed to the emergence of an unemployment rate gap between Canada and the United States. In that decade, unemployment insurance benefits became taxable, income tax fates fell substantially, and various administrative changes were made that effectively tightened unemployment insurance eligibility requirements. These policy changes are evaluated in the context of a computable equilibrium model of the labour market. Our estimates suggest that all of these reforms together can account for no more than a 0.4 percentage point decline in the US natural rate of unemployment; a combined effect which accounts for 20 per cent of the unemployment rate gap.

AB BACKGROUND. The goal of this study was to analyze the presenting features, natural history, and prognostic factors in 59 patients with well characterized mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
   METHODS. Cases were classified as nodular or diffuse and as typical or blastic variants. Age, performance status (PS), histologic variants, mitotic index (MI), hematologic parameters, tumor extension data, and International Prognostic Index (IPI) were recorded and evaluated for prognosis.
   RESULTS. The median age of the patients was 63 years (range, 39-83 years), and the male to female ratio was 3:1. Fifty-three patients had typical histology (3 nodular and 50 diffuse), and 6 had the blastic variant. Approximately 95% of patients presented with advanced stage disease (Ann Arbor Stage III-IV). Leukemic expression was observed in 58%. Complete and partial response rates were 19% and 46%, respectively. Parameters associated with lower response rate were Stage IV, high/intermediate or high risk IPI, and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. In the logistic regression analysis, high LDH level and Stage IV disease were associated independently with lower response rate. Median survival was 49 months. Parameters associated with a short survival were: poor PS, splenomegaly, B-symptoms, MI > 2.5, leukocyte count > 10 X 10(9)/L, high LDH level, blastic variant, and high/intermediate or high risk IPI. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model, only poor PS (relative risk [RR] = 3.3; P = 0.002), splenomegaly (RR = 2.8; P = 0.007), and MI > 2.5 (RR = 2.4; P = 0.012) were associated with short survival.
   CONCLUSIONS. In this series, patients with MCL presented with advanced stage and extranodal involvement. Only a minority of patients achieved a complete response. The median survival was 4 years, with PS, splenomegaly, and MI being the most important factors predicting survival. These results show clearly that more effective therapies for MCL are needed.

AB Study objectives: To determine the median survival of patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, in comparison to that expected of individuals of the same age and sex from the general population. To estimate the effect of survival bias incurred by studying both incident and prevalent cases. To identify factors associated with survival.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Nine hospitals from the Trent Region of England.
   Patients: Two hundred forty-four cases of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis: 168 patients were alive on day 1 of the study (prevalent cases), and 76 patients had newly diagnosed conditions over a prospective 18-month period of patients recruitment (incident cases).
   Measurements: Age, sex, date of diagnosis, lung function at presentation, and details of treatment prescribed were extracted from hospital clinical records. Data on lifetime smoking habits were collected by postal questionnaire. Vital status was established from the general practitioner. The expected survival of each case was extracted from the English life tables.
   Results: Median survival for incident cases was 2.9 years and for prevalent cases 9 years, compared to expected values of 10 and 13 years, respectively. Incident cases had significantly worse survival than prevalent cases, even after adjustment for the effects of age, sex, smoking history, lung function at presentation, and treatment (hazard ratio, 4.53 [95% confidence interval, 2.71 to 7.56]; p < 0.001). Lower FVC at presentation and the use of corticosteroid treatment were both associated with worse survival.
   Conclusions: The inclusion of prevalent cases leads to significant overestimation of the median survival for patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. In newly diagnosed cases of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, median survival is only 2.9 years, and expected life span is reduced by approximately 7 years.

TI Activities implemented jointly and the use of fuel alcohol in Brazil for
   abating CO2 emissions
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB A sustained economic growth with low environmental hazards is a major challenge for modern society, Abating CO2 gas emissions together with the rational uses of energy from clean sources is recognized as a priority worldwide, In this connection, this paper focuses on the possibilities for stimulating and expanding the production of fuel alcohol from sugarcane and the generation of thermoelectricity from bagasse, in the context of Activities Implemented Jointly. A methodology for calculating the CO2 abatement costs in different scenarios for the use of fuel alcohol and bagasse is presented, The base scenario is constructed starting from an estimate of the motor vehicle fleet run on gasoline and on fuel alcohol, It is assumed the decreasing of alcohol vehicle fleet, as it happens now and a blend of gasoline with only 10 % of anhydrous alcohol, So, it is calculated the consumption of gasoline and alcohol up to the time horizon at the year 2010, as well as the total fuel costs using different hypothesis for the oil price. The alcohol cost is taken as constant in dollars of 1993 and equal to its value just before the overvalorization of the exchange rate between the Brazilian currency (Real-R$) and the US$, it is assumed that this exchange rate will probably be changed in the next Sears. It is considered in the base scenario alternatives of electricity expansion using coal, fuel oil and natural gas, The carbon emissions and thermoelectricity generation are obtained in two scenarios for abating CO2 emissions by alcohol vehicle fleet besides the use of a blend of gasoline and 22 % alcohol, as well as by implementing electricity generation with sugar cane bagasse, It is calculated the planted area with sugar cane to meet the alcohol and bagasse demand in each scenario,The abatement costs in the different scenarios, taking as reference the base scenario, is calculated, The main conclusion is that the abatement cost decreases along the time and with the increase of CO2 abatement, reaching a value lower than US$ 10 t(-1) CO2 in the year 2010.

AB Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a relatively uncommon but important potentially reversible cause of renal failure. Little is known about the natural history of ischemic renal disease secondary to RAS. In previous reports, these researchers examined the incidence and risk factors associated with RAS. The study presented here investigates the long-term follow-up of these patients, specifically the effect of RAS on 4-yr, all-cause mortality in a group of 1235 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization and abdominal aortography. A total of 1235 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization also underwent an abdominal flush aortogram. Significant RAS was considered present if one or more renal artery had 50% or greater narrowing in luminal diameter. Four-year unadjusted survival for patients with RAS was 65% compared with 86% for patients undergoing catheterization without significant RAS. Factors associated with decreased 4-yr survival included increased age, increased serum creatinine, presence of RAS. peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and reduced ejection fraction. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, the factors associated with decreased 4-yr survival were the presence of significant RAS, reduced ejection fraction, elevated serum creatinine, and symptoms of congestive heart failure. These observations indicate that the presence of significant RAS is a strong independent predictor of 4-yr survival in this patient population.

ID RISK ASSESSMENT
AB A reinforced concrete nuclear power plant containment structure is subjected to various random static and stochastic loads during its lifetime. Since these loads involve inherent randomness and other uncertainties, an appropriate probabilistic model for each load must be established in order to perform reliability analysis. The current ASME code for reinforced concrete containment structures are not based on probability concepts. The stochastic nature of natural hazard or accidental loads and the variations of material properties require a probabilistic approach for a rational assessment of structural safety and performance. The paper develops probability-based load factors for the limit state design of reinforced concrete containment structures. The purpose of constructing reinforced concrete containment structure is to protect against radioactive release, and so the use of a serviceability limit state against crack failure that can cause the emission of radioactive materials is suggested as a critical limit state for reinforced concrete containment structures. Load factors for the design of reinforced concrete containment structures are proposed and carried out the reliability assessments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

AB The long-term natural course of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is studied in order to determine whether severity of nocturnal oxygen desaturation associated with apnea/hypopnea, body mass index (BMI), and hypertension influence survival in young (<40 years), middle-aged (40-64 years), and aged (greater than or equal to 65 years) using a questionnaire survey. One hundred and forty-eight patients with OSAS aged 17-78 years (136 men, 12 women, mean 52.0+/-12.3 years), who were diagnosed by standard polysomnography (PSG) between 1983 and 1993, participated in the study. The survey revealed 15 deaths and 101 survivors; 32 subjects could not be located. The survival rate nas 71.4% (95% confidence interval: 55.6-87.2%). The survival rate in patients with OSAS was significantly longer than that in the age and sex-adjusted control Japanese population (87.6%). In the young group, only one death (a 19-year-old woman) occurred unexpectedly during sleep. The patient showed an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 33 per h and the length of time that the nocturnal oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) fell below 90% (time of SaO(2) < 90%) of 205 min. The survival rate in middle-aged patients with OSAS was significantly longer than that in the age and sex-adjusted control Japanese population (79.2 vs 91.0%), but this pattern was not seen among the aged. Time of SaO(2) <90% was significantly longer in the middle-aged patients than in the aged patients, but AHI did not differ between the two groups. Moreover, it was significantly correlated with AHI in middle-aged patients, but not in the aged patients. The survival rate was significantly lower in patients with hypertension than in the patients without such complications in the middle-aged group (57.9 vs 90.4%). Cox proportional-hazard regression model including age, hypertension, BMI, AHI, lowest SaO(2), and time of SaO(2) < 90% showed that hypertension was only significantly associated with lower survival rate in total group and middle-aged patients, but not in the young or aged patients. The prognosis in patients with OSAS may differ among the generations. The prognosis in the middle-aged population may depend on the role or OSAS on the complications of hypertension or severity of oxygen desaturation, but not on AHI only.

AB Background Hereditary breast cancer has been associated with mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and has a natural history different from sporadic breast cancer. We investigated disease-free and overall survival for patients with a proven BRCA1 alteration.
   Methods We estimated disease-free adn overall survival for 49 Dutch patients from 19 consecutive families with a proven specific BRCA1 mutation and one family with strong evidence for linkage to the BRCA1 gene. We compared clinical outcome and data on tumour size, histology, axillary nodal status, contralateral breast cancer, and oestrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status with those of 196 patients with sporadic breast cancer, matched for age and year of diagnosis.
   Findings Disease-free survival for BRCA1 and sporadic patients at 5 years was 49% (95% CI 33-64) and 51% (43-59), respectively (p=0.98). Overall survival at 5 years was 63% (47-76) and 69% (62-76), respectively (p=0.88). Recurrence and death rates did not differ significantly between groups. Hazard ratios for recurrence and death among BRCA1 patients were 1.00 (0.65-1.55) and 1.04 (0.63-1.71) relative to sporadic patients (p=0.88), and these did not differ significantly after adjustment for prognostic factors. Patients with BRCA1-associated breast cancer had twice as many progesterone-receptor-negative tumours (p<0.005) and development of contralateral breast cancer was four to five times as frequent as in the sporadic group (p<0.001).
   Interpretation We showed that disease-free and overall survival were similar for sporadic and hereditary breast cancer in the presence of different tumour characteristics, which has implications for screening prophylactic therapy, and different treatments of hereditary breast cancer.

AB Context.-Medical evidence may be biased over time if completion and publication of randomized efficacy trials are delayed when results are not statistically significant.
   Objective.-To evaluate whether the time to completion and the time to publication of randomized phase 2 and phase 3 trials are affected by the statistical significance of results and to describe the natural history of such trials.
   Design.-Prospective cohort of randomized efficacy trials conducted by 2 trialist groups from 1986 to 1996.
   Setting.-Multicenter trial groups in human immunodeficiency virus infection sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.
   Patients.-A total of 109 efficacy trials (total enrollment, 43 708 patients). Main Outcome Measures.-Time from start of enrollment to completion of follow-up and time from completion of follow-up to peer-reviewed publication assessed with survival analysis.
   Results.-The median time from start of enrollment to publication was 5.5 years and was substantially longer for negative trials than for results favoring an experimental arm (6.5 vs 4.3 years, respectively; P<.001; hazard ratio for time to publication for positive vs negative trials, 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-7.7). This difference was mostly attributable to differences in the time from completion to publication (median, 3.0 vs 1.7 years for negative vs positive trials; P<.001). On average, trials with significant results favoring any arm completed follow-up slightly earlier than trials with nonsignificant results (median, 2.3 vs 2.5 years; P=.045), but long-protracted trials often had low event rates and failed to reach statistical significance, while trials that were terminated early had significant results. Positive trials were submitted for publication significantly more rapidly after completion than were negative trials (median, 1.0 vs 1.6 years; P=.001) and were published more rapidly after submission (median, 0.8 vs 1.1 years; P=.04).
   Conclusion.-Among randomized efficacy trials, there is a time lag in the publication of negative findings that occurs mostly after the completion of the trial follow-up.

AB Objective: To assess the impact of opportunistic diseases on survival in patients with HIV disease.
   Methods: A cohort of 2081 patients followed for a mean of 30 months was studied. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed using incident opportunistic diseases and CD4 cell counts as independent variables.
   Results: During follow-up, 730 (35%) patients died. The occurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, Candida esophagitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), dementia, wasting, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis were all significantly associated with death, independently of CD4 cell count (all P < 0.001 for opportunistic diseases controlling for CD4 cell count). The magnitude of increased risk was greatest for lymphoma [relative hazard (RH), 7.2], PML (RH, 3.9), MAC (RH, 3.0) and CMV (RH, 2.2). Cryptococcosis (RH, 0.94) and herpes zoster (RH, 0.85) were not associated with death. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, MAC [RH, 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.1-3.1], CMV (RH, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.3-2.1), toxoplasmosis (RH, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6), PCP (RH, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5), and CD4 cell count were significantly associated with death. Patients who had opportunistic diseases had significantly greatly monthly declines in CD4 counts (-11 x 10(6)/l per month) than those who did not (-6 x 10(6)/l per month; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Most opportunistic diseases increase the risk of death independently of CD4 cell count. These data support the hypothesis that opportunistic diseases enhance HIV pathogenesis and further underscore the importance of prophylaxis.

AB Vulnerability assessments are widely employed to assist planning for major natural disasters in many cities, including metropolitan Tokyo, Continuing assessments carried out by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government use geographical information systems as analytical tools. They rely almost exclusively on data about the physical environment, on counts of human numbers at risk and on information about selected economic dimensions of hazard, Other vitally important aspects of social vulnerability are neglected. As a first step towards developing improved socially sensitive vulnerability assessments, three universities in Japan and the USA have initiated a pilot study of vulnerability to cyclones and earthquakes among the homeless population of Tokyo, This is intended to develop a reliable model of social vulnerability among one marginalized group that can be used to improve disaster planning and management among the homeless and other 'special needs' groups in megacities at risk throughout the world.

AB Information about temporal variations in risk, attributable to changes in the human component of natural disasters, is rarely included in disaster assessments carried out by hazard management professionals, Whereas the risk of extreme natural events will probably remain unchanged during the lifetimes of today's population, the probability of large urban disasters appears to be increasing rapidly. Recent earthquakes in Northridge (1994) and Kobe (1995) are indicators of these trends. This paper introduces an integrated approach to urban risk assessment that focuses on the changing risk and vulnerabilities of large cities to earthquakes. These cities can be thought of as complex socio-technical systems, comprising interdependent subsystems that may be modelled econometrically, The construction of one such model is discussed, as well as the procedure for simulating changes in case-study urban areas over different time periods, with and without the occurrence of major earthquakes. Implications of the model for hazard management are identified. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB The use of genetically engineered crop plants has raised concerns about the risks these crops pose to natural and agricultural ecosystems. The potential environmental hazards of transgenic woody biomass crops is discussed, and based on the biology of these crops and their transgenes, recommend a scientific framework for assessing risk. The potential impacts of transgenes based on both characteristics of the transgenic crop and potential for spread of the transgene to other organisms is considered. It is argued that risk assessment should focus exclusively on the phenotype expected from the transgene within a given plant host and environment, weighing both the costs of foregoing the benefits a transgenic variety can provide and the possibility of adverse environmental effects. Basic principles of population genetics can be used to facilitate prediction of the potential for transgenes to spread and establish in natural ecosystems. For example, transgenes that are expected to have neutral or deleterious effects on tree fitness, including those for lignin modification, reproductive sterility and antibiotic resistance, should be of little environmental concern in most biomass crop systems. In contrast, transgenes that are likely to substantially affect host fitness pose a greater risk, as are plants with transgenes which produce a substance known to disrupt ecological processes. Field experiments to determine population replacement and transgene flow are desirable for testing such predictions; however, the long generation times of tree crops makes such studies prohibitive. It is argued that a combination of demographic data from existing non-transgenic populations, simulation modeling of transgene dispersal, and monitoring field releases can be used to guide current risk assessment and can be used to further scientific knowledge for future assessment.

AB The idea that synthetic chemicals such as DDT are major contributors to human cancer has been inspired, in part, by Rachel Carson's passionate book, Silent Spring, This chapter discusses evidence showing why this is not true. We also review research on the causes of cancer, and show why much cancer is preventable.
   Epidemiological evidence indicates several factors likely to have a major effect on reducing rates of cancer: reduction of smoking, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, and control of infections. Other factors are avoidance of intense sun exposure, increases in physical activity, and reduction of alcohol consumption and possibly red meat. Already, risks of many forms of cancer can be reduced and the potential for further reductions is great. If lung cancer (which is primarily due to smoking) is excluded, cancer death rates are decreasing in the United States for all other cancers combined.
   Pollution appears to account for less than 1% of human cancer; yet public concern and resource allocation for chemical pollution are very high, in good part because of the use of animal cancer tests in cancer risk assessment. Animal cancer tests, which are done at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), are being misinterpreted to mean that low doses of synthetic chemicals and industrial pollutants are relevant to human cancer. About half of the chemicals tested, whether synthetic or natural, are carcinogenic to rodents at these high doses. A plausible explanation for the high frequency of positive results is that testing at the MTD frequently can cause chronic cell killing and consequent cell replacement, a risk factor for cancer that can be limited to high doses. Ignoring this greatly exaggerates risks. Scientists must determine mechanisms of carcinogenesis for each substance and revise acceptable dose levels as understanding advances.
   The vast bulk of chemicals ingested by humans is natural. For example, 99.99% of the pesticides we eat are naturally present in plants to ward off insects and other predators. Half of these natural pesticides tested at the MTD an rodent carcinogens. Reducing exposure to the 0.01% that are synthetic will not reduce cancer rates. On the contrary, although fruits and vegetables contain a wide variety of naturally-occurring chemicals that are rodent carcinogens, inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables doubles the human cancer risk for most types of cancer. Making them more expensive by reducing synthetic pesticide use will increase cancer. Humans also ingest large numbers of natural chemicals from cooking food. Over a thousand chemicals have been reported in roasted coffee: more than half of those tested (19/28) are rodent carcinogens. There are more rodent carcinogens in a single cup of coffee than potentially carcinogenic pesticide residues in the average American diet in a year, and there are still a thousand chemicals left to test in roasted coffee. This does not mean that coffee is dangerous but rather that animal cancer tests and worst-case risk assessment, build in enormous safety factors and should not be considered true risks.
   The reason humans can eat the tremendous variety of natural chemical "rodent carcinogens" is that humans, like other animals, are extremely well protected by many general defense enzymes, most of which are inducible (i.e., whenever a defense enzyme is in use, more of it is made). Since the defense enzymes are equally effective against natural and synthetic chemicals one does not expect, nor does one find, a general difference between synthetic and natural chemicals in ability to cause cancer in high-dose rodent tests.
   The idea that there is an epidemic of human cancer caused by synthetic industrial chemicals is false. In addition, there is a steady rise in life expectancy in the developed countries. Linear extrapolation from the maximum tolerated dose in rodents to low level exposure in humans has led to grossly exaggerated mortality forecasts. Such extrapolations can not be verified by epidemiology. Furthermore, relying on such extrapolations for synthetic chemicals while ignoring the enormous natural background, leads to an imbalanced perception of hazard and allocation of resources. It is the progress of scientific research and technology that will continue to lengthen human life expectancy.
   Zero exposure to rodent carcinogens cannot be achieved. Low levels of rodent carcinogens of natural origin are ubiquitous in the environment. It is thus impossible to obtain conditions totally free of exposure to rodent carcinogens or to background radiation. Major advances in analytical techniques enable the detection of extremely low concentrations of all substances, whether natural or synthetic, often thousands of times lower than could be detected 30 years ago.
   Risks compete with risks: society must distinguish between significant and trivial risks. Regulating trivial risks or exposure to substances erroneously inferred to cause cancer at low-doses, can harm health by diverting resources from programs that could be effective in protecting the health of the public. Moreover, wealth creates health: poor people have shorter life expectancy than wealthy people. When money and resources are wasted on trivial problems, society's wealth and hence health is harmed.

TI Natural radioactivity in Jordanian soil and building materials and the
   associated radiation hazards
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
LA English
DT Article
ID RADON EXHALATION
AB Natural radioactivity in soil and building materials was determined using gamma spectrometry. Samples were collected from the populated areas of Jordan. Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 activities were determined. Soil samples collected from the Jordan valley showed high K-40 concentrations which were due to the presence of a potash factory in the valley. One soil sample from southern sector showed very high Ra-226 activity (i.e. 774 Bq kg(-1)). The derived data were compared with the reported data for other countries in the world.
   Radium-equivalent activities were calculated for soil and building materials to assess the radiation hazards. Only one soil sample showed very high Ra-eq activities (i.e. 979 Bq kg(-1)). All the other soil samples showed Ra-eq activities within the limit set by OECD countries (i.e. 370 Bq kg(-1)). A few marble chips samples also showed Ra-eq activities greater than the OECD limit. Most of the materials examined are acceptable for use as building materials in accord with the OECD criterion. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Factors associated with the initiation of smoking by Kuwaiti males
SO JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE

DT Article
ID CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NATURAL-HISTORY; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; CHILDREN
AB Purpose: To estimate the age patterns in cumulative probability of smoking initiation among Kuwaiti adult males and to study the differentials in smoking initiation in relation to factors such as age-cohort, marital status, educational level, income, type of residence, and history of smoking among family members and friends. Methods: A stratified three stage cluster sampling design was implemented for the selection of the sample. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 1798 Kuwaiti adult males working in different ministries. Results and implications. Of the 1798 respondents, 34.4% were classified as current smokers, 17.7% as former smokers and 47.9% as non-smokers. The highest probability of smoking initiation (among current and former smokers) was found for the age group 15-20 years, where almost 29% of the respondents initiated smoking In the univariate analysis, marital status, education, income, type of residence, and history of smoking among family members and friends showed significant variation in the age-patterns of initiation. In the Cox proportional hazard regression model, education, type of residence, and history of smoking among family members and friends were found to be independently associated with the risk of initiation. The highest risk of initiation (Relative Risk (RR) = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.62-2.10) was found among those who had a history of smoking in family and friends. Individuals in the lowest education category (RR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.32-2.04) and those residing in apartments (RR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.43-1.92) were at a higher risk of initiation compared with those who had university education or those who resided in villas. The results of the study should prompt further efforts to develop tobacco control policies in Kuwait and the other Arabian Gulf countries to help establish norms for not initiating smoking through persistent messages to not start or to stop smoking. There is also a need to enhance awareness about the influence of smokers in family or friends on other people to initiate smoking.

AB The identification of factors which are related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression, either by a direct interaction with HIV to increase the rate of disease progression or by providing an indication of an infected individual's likely prognosis, can have great value when understanding HIV pathogenesis and in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. This paper describes the roles of the CD4 cell count and the viral load as markers of disease progression and discusses the recent findings on chemokine receptors in HIV infection. Our current knowledge on these factors is summarized and unresolved statistical issues are highlighted.

ID NATURAL DURABILITY
AB Data about untreated wood exposed in the Nordic test fields from 1943 and onwards have been evaluated concerning differences in microbial activity between and within fields, durability of some wood species in different fields. Data have been supplemented with new field tests with mini stakes and tests in terrestrial microcosms (TMCs) with unsterile soils. Results show that the deterioration of untreated wood exposed in fields in the Nordic countries is more dependent on local occurrence of different types of wood decay than on geographical location. Dominating types of attack in exposed stakes differ between fields and the hazards within a field can vary. No correlation between density and durability within a wood species was found. Results of exposure of wood stakes in TMCs with soil from the test fields correspond relatively well with results from field tests, and analysis of the TMC stakes increases the understanding of varying decay processes occurring during field testing.

   study of El Minia El Gedida site, Egypt
SO NATURAL HAZARDS

AB The plateau east of the Nile Valley at El Minia, Egypt, has been chosen for the siting of El Minia El Gedida city. Problems of underground caves suggested the need for integral geological, geotechnical and environmental hazard studies to examine the suitability of the area as a building site.
   Geologically, the area is formed of a thick sequence of Middle Eocene fossiliferous limestones and chalk with some layers of sandy, cherty and marry limestones. These rocks have heterogeneous physical and mechanical properties and fall within the weak to very weak range of limestones. Their mode of failure is almost of the brittle type developing extension, wedge and single shear type fractures. The mechanical properties are controlled by their physical, geological and mineralogical properties. They increase with density and dolomite content and decrease with porosity and calcite content. Empirical equations for some of these relations as well as the relation between field measures of rebound index and compressive strength are presented.
   Both regional and detailed structural analyses revealed the presence of major and minor normal faults and fractures trending in NW and NE directions. The NW faults are dominant. They define the topographic escarpments in the area. Most of the caves are aligned along major faults of this trend. Faults, fracture distribution and structural hazard maps of the area are presented. Paleostress tectonic analysis of these fractures suggests that the NW and NE faults are extensional due to tectonic stress which changes from normal to parallel to the Red Sea at different geologic times starting in post Middle Eocene. The similarity of this paleotectonic setting to present Red Sea tectonics points out the possibility of future rejuvenation of these faults.
   Topographically, the area lies in shallow surface drainage basins. The topographical risk is increased by fracturing and it should be considered if the area is subjected to a long period of heavy rainfall. Radiometrically, El Minia El Gedida city represents one of the lowest natural radioactivity areas within the safe limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

ID BARRIERS
AB Presented are results of a mathematical analysis on radionuclide transport in parallel planar fractures in water-saturated geologic formations integrated with the source term model, where precipitation of hardly soluble species at the waste-form alteration location and subsequent radionuclide transport in the engineered barriers are considered, Radioactive decay chains of an arbitrary length are considered, A computer code has been developed based on the analytical solutions.
   The major hazard contributors are Am-241 and Am-243 in the waste form; Pu-239, Th-229, and Am-243 at the surface of the engineered barriers; Ra-223, Pa-231, and Ac-227 at a 10-m location from the engineered barriers; and Tc-99, Ra-223, and Ra-225 at a 100-m location. With a transport distance of 100 m through the natural barrier; a four-orders-of-magnitude reduction in the total hazard is observed.
   Thus, the importance of the region in the vicinity of the engineered barriers in the context of the safety assessment can be pointed out, Because the region is disturbed by repository construction, further analysis must be performed by taking into account differing geochemical, hydrological, and mechanical properties from those in the undisturbed host rock.
   Because the major contributors in the host rock are the decay daughters of minor actinides, recovery of minor actinides reduces the total hazard evaluated at the exit of the geosphere, However, the radiological hazard would be reduced much more effectively by the 100-m-thick geologic formation around the repository than by even a 99% recovery of the actinides.

ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE
AB The fast-growing, coastal megacities of the Asia-Pacific region are expanding into areas that are vulnerable to marine-related physical natural hazards, or, because of physical environmental changes, will become increasingly vulnerable within the timescale of city planning. The hazards comprise those that are due to extreme events such as storm surge and tsunami which may be catastrophic in their impacts; and those that relate to continuing changes over the long-term, notably global sea-lever rise, sedimentary consolidation and coastal erosion. The latter may be exacerbated by human activities such as the increasing production of 'greenhouse' gases and over-abstraction of groundwater, and, while not threatening catastrophic loss of life or destruction of property, do have important economic and social implications for the future.
   There are two complementary approaches to hazard mitigation - constraining the hazard, and reducing vulnerability to the hazard. The contributions that science can make in the planning and implementation of sustainable adaptive measures are to improve the quantification of the incidence and severity of the various hazards, establishing realistic timescales of incidence, estimating return periods; and to establish the geographical limits of vulnerability to the hazards in a range of likely scenarios over timescales appropriate to the planning cycle. Contemporary, high risk, hazard scenarios for existing city developments demand an approach which focuses on effective warning networks and emergency planning; long-term, incremental hazards that are forecast to affect both developed and periurban areas can be addressed with a strategic planning approach, involving relocation and capital protective works. The selection of strategic measures demands the best possible predictive information on hazards and on vulnerability, including its full socio-economic evaluation so that the costs and benefits of the possible mitigation options can be realistically assessed. A predictive capacity, developed through modelling, requires the collection of reliable baseline and monitoring data relating to the hazards over a range of timescales in local, regional and global perspectives.

TI The reversed hazard rate function
SO PROBABILITY IN THE ENGINEERING AND INFORMATIONAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we discuss some properties of the reversed hazard rate function. This function has been shown to be useful in the analysis of data in the presence of left censored observations. It is also natural in discussing lifetimes with reversed time scale. In fact, ordinary hazard rate functions are most useful for lifetimes, and reverse hazard rates are natural if the time scale is reversed. Mixing up these concepts can often, although not always, lead to anomalies. For example, one result gives that if the reversed hazard rate function is increasing, its interval of support must be (-infinity,b) where b is finite. Consequently nonnegative random variables cannot have increasing reversed hazard rates. Because of this result some existing results in the literature on the reversed hazard rate ordering require modification.
   Reversed hazard rates are also important in the study of systems. Hazard rates have an affinity to series systems; reversed hazard rates seem more appropriate for studying parallel systems. Several results are given that demonstrate this. In studying systems, one problem is to relate derivatives of hazard rate functions and reversed hazard rate functions of systems to similar quantities for components. We give some results that address this. Finally, we carry out comparisons for k-out-of-n systems with respect to the reversed hazard rate ordering.

AB Historically, human civilisations have striven to protect themselves against natural and man-made hazards. The degree of protection is a matter of political choice. Today this choice should be expressed in terms of risk and acceptable probability of failure to form the basis of the probabilistic design of the protection. It is additionally argued that the choice for a certain technology and the connected risk is made in a cost-benefit framework. The benefits and the costs including risk are weighed in the decision process. A set of rules for the evaluation of risk is proposed and tested in cases. The set of rules leads to technical advice in a question that has to be decided politically. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB Natural Hazards are mostly related to the actuation of active geomorphological-geological processes that condition landform development. The objective of this work is to evaluate a method to combine digital image processing techniques and GIS analysis in order to extract and classify the main terrain attributes that identify Natural Hazard prone areas and to improve the accuracy of the differentiated terrain mapping units. Synergism of multisensor data of different spectral and spatial resolutions (SPOT PAN and Landsat TM images), together with the use of a Digital Elevation Model for rectifying the multisensor data set and for relief quantification contribute to the delineation of terrain mapping units. Additionally, spatial frequency filtering is applied for the enhancement of geomorphological linear features, specially in those images with greater spatial resolution. The resultant integration of Remote Sensing imagery with conventional data (field work and thematic maps) in a GIS is an efficient tool for the assessment and mapping of Natural Hazards.

AB Modern space navigational system GPS Navstar and its Russian analogue GLONASS allow to measure not only phase, but also group delays of the signals propagating through the ionosphere. Possibility of total electron content absolute measurements removes problem of unknown initial phase always existing for phase measurements in 150/400 MHz band but ground-based ionosphere tomography on GPS basis is impossible for realization. To remove these difficulties we offer to replace angular transmitter movement as it is in the case of radiotomography using TRANSIT system by fast moving of a receiver located on board of low-orbital satellite, thus having saved the condition of frozen ionosphere during measurements. For this purposes it is convenient to use independent compact satellites separated from space station ALFA. It is shown that equal inclinations of GPS orbits and orbital system ALFA provide ideal conditions for 2D-radiotomography application GPS-based tomographic reconstraction provides the possibility to study the ionosphere above the ISS orbit, which is very interesting from a scientific point of view. During some ISS orbits one can map the global structure of the ionosphere which is very useful also for monitoring and forecasting of natural hazards (earthquakes). (C) 1998 COSPAR.

AB The BSE epidemic in the UK is declining rapidly in response to control measures and is en route for eradication by the year 2001. BSE infectivity is restricted in clinically affected natural cases of BSE to central nervous tissues. BSE agent has been isolated from the intestine of experimentally orally-infected cattle from six to 18 months post-challenge. A small maternal risk factor for BSE has been identified but this will not stop the eradication of BSE. To protect the integrity of biological products from the risks associated with the unknown hazard of BSE for man it is recommended that only safe sources of animals and tissues are used. Inactivation procedures employed during processing will provide further guarantees.

AB Results from a research study funded by the U.S. Geological Survey as part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program are presented. The first objective of this study was the development of a database for all 211 bridges along Interstate 55 in the New Madrid region of southeastern Missouri. Profiles for five key dimension parameters (which are stored in the database) were developed, and the results for steel highway bridges are presented here. The second objective was to perform held ambient vibration analyses on 25 typical bridge spans along the I-55 corridor. These 25 spans included 17 steel girder spans. Eight seismometers were used to record ambient vibrations at four locations on each bridge span. These records of bridge motion versus time were each subjected to a fast Fourier transformation, and plots of amplitude versus frequency were generated. These plots were used to determine the fundamental vertical and lateral frequencies of the bridge spans measured. The third objective was to use these fundamental frequencies in conjunction with the dimension parameters stored in the database to develop empirical formulas for estimating fundamental frequencies. These formulas were applied to all 211 Interstate highway bridges in southeastern Missouri. Profiles for both the fundamental vertical and the lateral frequencies were then developed, and the results for the steel highway bridges are presented here.

DE wastewater; helminth eggs; rainwater
AB Rainwater runoff in urban areas removes helminth eggs into the sewer system where they are carried to the treatment plant by the rainwater or remain in the sewer system until the next heavy rainfall. The concentration of parasite eggs varies according to the water flow rates in the urban system. Heavy rain cleans both the urban surfaces and the drains. In particular, it removes particles less than 100 mu m diameter which are laid down in the pipes. These particles are present in high concentration in storm water whenever heavy rain is preceded by days with low rainfall. Variations in parasite concentration are thus dependent upon the precipitation of the previous days making it difficult to predict the concentrations of parasites in raw wastewater at input to the treatment plant. Many factors may affect parasite concentration including the presence of sediment in the sewer system, the intensity of rainfall and the amount of rain that has fallen on previous days. Parasites account for only a small proportion of the mass of suspended solids in rainwater. However, they represent a major health hazard in case of overflow of storm water associated with wastewater into the natural environment. (C) 1998 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Landslides are a common natural hazard in mountainous terrain like the Himalaya. In the present study, an area of 445 sq km around Dehra Dun and Mussoorie in Uttar Pradesh has been considered for landslide hazard analysis on a geomorphological basis. The analysis involves classification of the terrain into homogeneous units (terrain mapping subunits) based on relevant geomorphic parameters, and consequently the geomorphic processes including occurrence of landslides. The hazard in these units is evaluated on the basis of field settings. Decision rules for the allotment of a hazard score to a unit have also been framed. The data on geomorphological complexes, lithology, drainage density, relief and landslide distribution were used in a geographical information system (GIS) for the analysis. A final landslide hazard map with four classes - very high, high, low and very low has been prepared. Such a map proves extremely useful as a first generation map for planning detailed surveys in the high hazard areas. The effect of human interference on the environment, particularly depletion of the forest cover has been studied. The landuse/land cover data for a period of 60 years were analysed in a GIS to study the changes in the forest cover. The forested areas account only for 9% of the landslide occurrence. About 60% of the landslides are in non-forested areas that were forested in 1930.

AB Background: The increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in women of childbearing age led us to evaluate whether pregnancy affects the natural history of this disease.
   Objectives: To conduct a prospective study of women with known dates of HIV seroconversion to describe the incidence and outcome of pregnancy and to assess differences according to age and exposure group. To compare the rate of disease progression between pregnant and nonpregnant women.
   Patients: All participants, recruited from 14 clinical centers in Italy, had documented HIV-seronegative test results followed by confirmed positive test results within 2 years.
   Results: A total of 331 women, who had seroconversion between 1981 and 1994, were followed up for a median of 5.5 years from seroconversion; 94 developed HIV-related diseases, 47 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 53 had at least 1 CD4 cell count lower than 0.10x10(9/)L (<100 cells/mm(3)). Thirty-eight women (11.5%) were pregnant at the time of HIV seroconversion and 31 (9.4%) became pregnant after HIV seroconversion (cumulative incidence of pregnancy within 8 years of seroconversion, 28.9%; 95% confidence interval, 21.6%-36.2%). Forty-five (65.2%) of the 69 pregnancies were carried to term. There were no discernible differences in these findings by age or exposure group. Pregnant women did not experience a more rapid rate of progression of disease, even when adjusting for age, exposure group, CD4 cell count, or use of treatment (adjusted relative hazards: HIV-related diseases, 0.72; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 0.69; CD4 cell count <0.10x10(9)/L, 1.24).
   Conclusion: Women infected with HIV continue to become pregnant after seroconversion, yet pregnancy does not appear to influence the rate of progression of HIV disease.

AB Objectives: To describe time to tumor growth of a prospectively followed group of patients with small choroidal melanoma and to determine baseline clinical and photographic characteristics associated with lime to growth.
   Methods: The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) is a set of clinical trials designed to compare radiotherapy and enucleation in the treatment of medium- and large-size choroidal melanoma. From December 1986 to August 1989, patients with small choroidal melanoma, not large enough to be eligible for the COMS clinical trials, were offered participation in a nonrandomized prospective follow-up study. Small choroidal melanomas were defined as 1.0 to 3.0 mm in apical height and 5.0 to 16.0 mm in largest basal dimension. A total of 204 patients were enrolled in the study and were followed up annually through August 1989. An assessment of current size of tumor, treatment status, and vital status was conducted in 1993-1994; an additional assessment of treatment and vital status was performed in 1995-1996.
   Results: Of 188 small tumors not treated at the time of study enrollment. 46 grew during follow-up to a size that was large enough to be eligible for the COMS clinical trials. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of proportion of tumors that grew were 21% (95% confidence interval, 14%-27%) by 2 years and 31% (95% confidence interval, 23%-39%) by 5 years. Factors significantly associated with time to growth in a Cox proportional hazards regression model were greater initial tumor thickness and diameter, presence of orange pigment, absence of drusen, and absence of areas of retinal pigment epithelial changes adjacent to the tumor.
   Conclusions: Of small choroidal melanomas initially managed by observation. 21% demonstrated growth by 2 years and 31% by 5 years. The clinical and photographic features of these tumors confirm previous findings and are useful in identifying patients with small tumors at highest risk of short-term growth.

AB As part of a series of papers to mark the 21st year of publication of Disasters, it is opportune to consider some of the changes that have occurred in the field it has covered so diligently for the last two decades. The paper begins with a brief review of the major natural disasters during this period and assesses their impact. It then considers the problem of how to define two key concepts: natural disaster and vulnerability, which remains an open question. The latter is one of the key determinants of the former. Next comes a review of what has occurred in the disasters field since the journal began publication, including some notes on the rise in vulnerability, the information technology revolution and the dilemmas of hazard mitigation. The following two sections assess, respectively, what hoped-for developments did not occur during the period studied and what assets were lost in the name of progress. For example, on the theoretical front, academic over-specialisation has predominated, while on the practical side there has been insufficient transfer of technology to where it is needed. The paper concludes that analyses of disaster need to become more sophisticated and multi-disciplinary and must take account of several forms of context within which developments take place.

AB Reports on the occurrence of fluoride in natural water resources and the associated health hazards due to human consumption have been made from many parts of India during the last decade. With the objective of organizing a systematic scientific programme to understand the behaviour of fluoride in natural water resources in relation to the local hydrogeological and climatic conditions and agricultural use, a typical area constituting the lower Vamsadhara River basin was chosen for a detailed study. fluoride concentrations in the groundwater reaching a maximum of 3.4 mg l(-1) were observed to be associated with weathered formations of pyroxene amphibolites and pegmatites. The groundwater in the clayey soils contained much less fluoride as compared to the sandy soils. The complex depositional pattern of these sandy and clayey soils plays an important role in the uneven spatial distribution of fluoride in the groundwater. The contribution of fluoride from geological formations is far greater than that from agriculture: the maximum yield of fluoride by superphosphate fertilizer to irrigation water is observed to be 0.34 mg l(-1). The fluoride concentration is expected to be increased in the future as the groundwater is subsaturated with respect to fluorite. An inverse relationship between F and Ca and positive relationships of F with Na, HCO3, PO4 and electrical conductivity were observed. Best relationships were obtained in the fluoride range of 1.0-3.4 mg l(-1).

AB Background. Penile carcinoma is uncommon in Western countries. Here we report on a large series of patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis, describing prognostic factors, survival and therapeutic results.
   Patients and methods: From 1973 to 1993, 102 patients with invasive SCC of the penis were treated at the Institut Gustave-Roussy. Precancerous lesions and conditions associated with penis cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and groups were compared for outcome by the log rank test for univariate comparisons and by Cox's proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis.
   Results: The median age at onset was 58 years. Sixty-nine patients presented with Jackson's stage I disease, 17 with stage II and 15 with stage III. The interval between the manifestation of symptoms and the diagnosis was more than a year in 13.7% of cases. Precancerous lesions were found in 17 (16.6%) patients, and a history of phimosis was noted in 25 (24.5%). In situ and invasive carcinoma were observed together in 17 (16.6%) cases and dysplasia was associated with invasive carcinoma in eight (7.8%) further cases.
   Conservative treatment was administered whenever feasible. Interstitial brachytherapy was performed alone or associated with limited surgery (local excision or circumcision) in 72 (70.6%) patients. Of the 28 patients with a local relapse, nine have died of their neoplasms (32%) compared to 21 of 28 patients with lymph node relapse (75%).
   The median follow-up was 111 months. Disease-free survival, disease-specific survival and overall survival were, respectively, 56%, 72% and 63% at five years and 42%, 66% and 50% at 10 years. Age (P = 0.01), the N status (P < 0.00001) or palpable nodes (P < 0.0038), corpus involvement (P = 0.006) and a verrucous histology (P = 0.038) had significant prognostic relevance for survival in the univariate analysis whereas the performance status, T status and Broders' grade did not. In the multivariate analysis only two parameters, involvement of the corpus (P < 0.0001) and palpable nodes (P = 0.009), were singled out as being independent variables influencing survival. A subgroup of nine patients with verrucous histologies were distinguished by their freedom from node involvement. These patients had an excellent prognosis: all are alive and disease-free. Penile integrity was preserved during follow-up in 54 patients (52.9%), 31 of whom are still alive. Of 72 patients treated by a conservative approach including brachytherapy, long-term penile integrity was maintained in 49 (68%).
   Conclusion. Corpus involvement and clinically palpable nodes are highly statistically significant independent factors influencing overall survival. Node relapses remain a major cause of death. Thus, better management of lymph nodes is essential for improving survival even when conservative therapy is used to treat the primary.

AB The primary and secondary treated waste effluents were successfully used to grow the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.). The growth rate of fish reared in treated waste water was significantly higher than that of fish reared in the natural habitat. Bacterial loads in fish organs were higher in the gills followed by the intestine and the skin and finally the edible muscles, The total aerobic bacterial count was very low (9.3 x 10(2) g(-1)) in the edible muscles of fish grown in secondary-treated effluent and complied with the WHO guidelines (less than 10(5) g(-1)). Salmonella, Shigella and Staphylococcus were completely absent in all fish samples examined. The highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in liver tissues, followed by intestine and gills and then the muscles. Accumulation levels were within the acceptable limits when compared to the international legal standards for hazardous elements in fish and fishery products, In conclusion chemical and bacterial analyses indicated that there is no evidence of any public health hazard associated with treated waste water reuse in aquaculture. However, the risks, if any, to the fish growers, processors and consumers should be evaluated, specially that related to viral pathogens.

AB The crude latex of Crown-of-Thorns (Euphorbia milli var. hislopii) is a potent plant molluscicide and a promising alternative to the synthetic molluscicides used in schistosomiasis control. The present study was undertaken to investigate the embryofeto-toxic potential of E. milii latex. The study is part of a comprehensive safety evaluation of this plant molluscicide. Lyophilized latex (0, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) in corn oil was given by gavage to Wistar rats (N = 100) from days 6 to 15 of pregnancy and cesarean sections were performed on day 21 of pregnancy. The numbers of implantation sites, living and dead fetuses, resorptions and corpora lutea were recorded. Fetuses were weighed, examined for external malformations, and fixed for visceral examination, or cleared and stained with Alizarin red S for skeleton evaluation. A reduction of body weight minus uterine weight at term indicated that E. milii latex was maternally toxic over the dose range tested. No latex-induced embryolethality was noted at the lowest dose (125 mg/kg) but the resorption rate was markedly increased at 250 mg/kg (62.5%) and 500 mg/kg (93.4%). A higher frequency of fetuses showing signs of delayed ossification (control: 17.4%; 125 mg/kg: 27.4% and 250 mg/kg: 62.8%; P<0.05 vs control) indicated that fetal growth was retarded at doses greater than or equal to 125 mg latex/kg body weight. No increase in the proportion of fetuses with skeletal anomalies was observed at the lowest dose but the incidence of minor skeletal malformations was higher at 250 mg/kg body weight (control: 13.7%; 125 mg/kg: 14.8%; 250 mg/kg: 45.7%; P<0.05 vs control). Since a higher frequency of minor malformations was noted only at very high doses of latex which are embryolethal and maternally toxic, it is reasonable to conclude that this plant molluscicide poses no teratogenic hazard or, at least, that this possibility is of a considerably low order of magnitude.

AB The accumulation and persistance in soil and other natural habitats of the insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis may result in environmental hazards, such as toxicity to nontarget species and the selection of toxin-resistant target species, We describe the use of flow cytometry as a method for detecting and tracking the fate of these insecticidal toxins in soil that does not require their extraction and purification. The toxins from B. thuringiensis subspp. tenebrionis and kurstaki were bound on clay- or silt-sized particles separated from Kitchawan soil that was unamended (naturally contains predominantly kaolinite) or amended to 6% v/v with the clay minerals montmorillonite or kaolinite (as an internal control). The particle-toxin mixtures were suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 3% nonfat milk powder to block nonspecific binding of antibody, resuspended in a solution of antibody to the toxin from B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis, and then resuspended in a solution of anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-Ab), Controls consisted of the particles alone and bound complexes of the particles with the toxin from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki. All particles that bound the toxin from B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis showed a significant shift in the peak of fluorescence to the right on the x axis as compared with the nonspecific fluorescence from the control FITC-Ab complexes with particles in the absence of the toxin. There was also a slight shift in the peak to the right for some particles that bound the toxin from B. thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis, as there is some cross-reactivity between the toxins from B. thuringiensis subspp. tenebrionis and kurstaki and the antibodies that they induce. This method is more sensitive and rapid than the dot-blot ELISA, and processing of many samples is easily accomplished.

DE seafood safety; seafood microbial hazards; coastal health
AB The United States is entering into a new era in which dwindling natural fisheries resources are forcing regulatory agencies to develop a more holistic approach to seafood safety and natural marine resource issues. Public health issues associated with seafoods can be grouped as (i) environmentally induced (i.e., natural or anthropogenic), (ii) process-induced, (iii) distribution-induced, or (iv) consumer-induced hazards. Similarly, loss of habitat and ecosystem degradation threaten the future viability of fisheries and have important ramifications for seafood safety. In the United States, large-scale legistlative efforts are underway to reexamine regulatory food control systems. The driving forces behind these efforts are the discovery of new emerging pathogens for which little information is available and dramatic improvements in analytic technology that allow for detection of low levels of microbial and chemical contaminants in foods. The global nature of seafood trading issues and the worldwide implementation of new preventative food safety programs such as hazard analysis for critical control points are driving some of the efforts to build new scientific bridges that will reevaluate current risk analysis strategies. New scientific bridges are needed to close the gaps between the scientific community and society concerning the effects of anthropogenic impacts on seafood safety and the heatlh of coastal habitats and associated fishery resources. The driving force behind this latter issue is the realization that the United States has lost over half of its original coastal wetlands areas. Protecting, conserving, and restoring the health and safety of our fisheries resources will require an integrated approach of food science and fishery science.

ID NET NATIONAL PRODUCT; SCARCITY; TRENDS
AB We derive a measure of national income, defined in terms of maximum sustainable per capita consumption. If population and interest rates are constant, the income generated by natural resource extraction is the return on resource wealth, defined as the present value of future resource rents. With a growing population or declining interest rate, sustainability requires net increases in wealth over time. The income fi om extraction of nonrenewable resources can exceed resource rents, contrary to the conclusions of El Serafy (1989) and Repetto et al. (1989). Finally, we present an example illustrating the hazard of consuming the full increment of Hicksian income.

ID EARTHQUAKES
AB Disasters are often represented as complete breakdowns of quasi-stationary states in a landscape, but may also be part of the normal evolution of such states. A landscape is, in fact, an open, nonlinear, dynamic system where the tectonic uplift and the seismic activity represent the input, the mass wastage and the relief degradation the output. The apparent 'stability' is due to the fact that open, nonlinear dynamic systems tend to develop into relatively stable, self-organized ordered states 'at the edge of chaos', with a fractal attractor. Short of complete breakdown, such systems re-establish order in steps of various magnitudes which have a power-law distribution. Because of the fractal structure of the basic attractor, all subsets follow a power law which accounts for the distribution of the steps of recovery. As the domains of quasi-stationarity at the edge of chaos are represented by finite windows, the power-law does not cover all magnitudes. The stationarity windows are not only limited in range, but also in space and time. This should be taken into account in the assessment of hazards. Examples are given from seismology (earthquake frequency), volcanology (eruption frequency), river hydrology (flood frequency) and geomorphology (landslides).

   mitigation programs; emergency management; IDNDR
AB Exposure to natural hazards tends to be poorly understood and yet implicitly accepted by a large proportion of populations at risk. Some people through years of experience and time-tested coping mechanisms effectively respond to most hazards. Others, lacking skills and experience, are dependent on institutional response systems for immediate assistance and long-term recovery. Clearly, both approaches can reduce losses; however, the former strategies often prove more cost effective. How then, can loss reduction be handled with minimal external involvement? Are there not strategies that can reduce the impact of natural hazards and minimize exposure to these risks? Introduction of hazard mitigation strategies can begin to address these concerns in a timely and cost effective manner. Federal institutions in Canada and the United States recognize this potential, and in response, have developed policies and designed programs to limit the impact of hazards. To further collective thinking on hazard mitigation, this paper surveys current legislation and programs in both countries, makes a comparative assessment, and seeks to identify implications for mitigation policy within the framework of the Canadian IDNDR initiative. Perceptions of mitigation are explored to create a common foundation from which to address the nature, direction, and structure of mitigation policy and programs in Canada. Clarity of purpose, awareness of context, and acknowledgment of limitations and conflicts represent crucial aspects in the evolution of mitigation strategies. Through awareness, understanding, and a willingness to engage in dialogue new ways of thinking can be employed to decrease the impact of natural hazards on society and the environment.

AB Many countries are developing concepts for geological disposal to achieve a permanent method of managing nuclear fuel wastes. This paper reviews the hazardous characteristics of nuclear fuel waste and discusses, in a semi-quantitative manner, the containment and retardation potential of various engineered and natural barriers. A durable waste form would retain the vast majority of radionuclides for many tens of thousands of years. Of the small inventory of radionuclides released from the waste form, many with relatively short half-lives decay to non-hazardous levels before release from the engineered barriers. The geosphere also has considerable containment potential, depending on its geological and hydrogeological properties. Approaches to selecting suitable combinations of engineered and natural barriers are illustrated based on long-term performance assessment case studies carried out in the Canadian Nuclear Fuel Waste Management program.

TI Risk of spontaneous haemorrhage after diagnosis of cerebral
   arteriovenous malformation
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; HEMORRHAGE; BRAIN; DETERMINANTS
AB Background A small proportion of strokes are caused by cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). Treatment to prevent intracranial haemorrhage itself carries risks, and untreated AVM may in many cases have a good prognosis. We investigated the risk of subsequent symptomatic bleeding in the clinical course of AVM in patients with and without an initial haemorrhage.
   Methods 281 unselected, consecutive, prospectively enrolled patients with cerebral AVM were grouped according to their initial clinical presentation-142 presented with and 139 without haemorrhage. The frequency of AVM haemorrhages during the subsequent clinical course (before the start of endovascular, surgical, or radiation treatment) in the two groups was compared by means of Kaplan-Meier life-tables, log-rank test, and multivariate proportional-hazards regression models, Haemorrhage was defined as a clinically symptomatic event with signs of acute bleeding on computed tomography or magnetic resonance brain imaging,
   Findings During mean follow-up of 8.5 months for the haemorrhage group and 11.9 months for the nonhaemorrhage group, haemorrhages occurred in 18 (13%) of the former patients and in three (2%) of the latter (p=0.0002). The annual risk of haemorrhage was 17.8% and 2.2%, respectively. In the multivariate regression model, the adjusted hazard ratio for haemorrhage at initial presentation was 139 (95% CI 2.6-73.8; p=0.002). Deep venous drainage (hazard ratio 4.1 [1.2-14.9], p=0.029) and male sex (9.2 [2.1-41.3], p=0.004) were also significantly associated with subsequent haemorrhage, but no significant association was found for age or AVM size. The annual rate of spontaneous haemorrhage was 32.6% for men and 10.4% for women in the haemorrhage group compared with 3.3% for men and 1.3% for women in the non-haemorrhage group. Among patients with haemorrhage at initial presentation, the risk of haemorrhage fell from 32.9% in year 1 to 11.3% in subsequent years (34.2% to 31.0% in men; 31.1% to 5.5% in women).
   Interpretation In AVM, patients initially presenting with haemorrhage have a higher risk of subsequent bleeding than those presenting with other symptoms. The risk is higher in men than in women.

AB Because considerable information about progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been provided by studies of cohorts of individuals with prevalent HIV infection, this study was designed to investigate bias due to onset confounding (differential time-since-infection distributions) and differential length-biased sampling in epidemiologic analyses of data from such cohorts. Subjects were participants in the Italian Seroconverters Study, a seroincident cohort of more than 1,200 adults seen at ambulatory care clinics in Italy, with observed HIV seroconversion in 1980-1988. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnoses, based on the 1987 Centers for Disease Control case definition, and mortality were ascertained through Italian national registries through 1994. To estimate bias in prevalent cohorts, a series of pseudo-seroprevalent (PSP) cohorts were drawn by sampling, from among the total seroincident cohort, prevalent AIDS-free subjects in each calendar year. The relative AIDS risk associated with a given covariate was calculated in each PSP cohort and compared with the relative AIDS risk for that covariate in the seroincident cohort. Relative risks were estimated by both the ratio of AIDS incidence densities and the relative AIDS hazards from proportional hazards regression. Differential length bias was not evident, as assessed in the following way: Among 338 individuals with seroconversion dates in 1983-1986, the relative risk of AIDS for subjects born before 1951 compared with those born more recently was 1.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-2.14). Although differential length-biased sampling was expected to bias this relative risk toward 1.0, the observed relative risk for earlier birth ranged from 1.79 to 2.86 in 1987-1992 PSP cohorts, Onset bias was observed: Among 644 subjects with seroconversion in 1980-1988, the AIDS relative risk for 1980-1985 seroconverters compared with 1986-1988 seroconverters was 1.09 (95% CI 0.76-1.55). Onset bias was seen in 1988-1990 PSP cohorts (relative risks for early seroconversion = 1.47, 1.46, and 1.34, respectively); in 1991-1992, relative risks were close to the expected value of 1.09, and Cls on relative risks from all PSP cohorts after 1989 included 1.0. Confounding attributable to differential length-biased sampling in prevalent cohorts does not necessarily bias estimates of the impact of covariates on rate of progression to AIDS. Bias can arise when a covariate suspected of affecting AIDS risk is closely linked to date of acquisition of HIV infection. However, onset bias appears to wane as subjects' dates of infection become more remote.

SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Catalonia; coastal zone; hazards; Mediterranean; resources
AB Coastal planning and management are experiencing a number of changes that point toward a major shift in emphasis from development to conservation. In this process, natural environments and processes traditionally perceived as hazardous to human occupation will be redefined in terms of being resources to protect for the benefit of present and future generations This process, however, is neither universal nor conflict free because development pressures maintain their strength in many parts of the world. This article examines the current situation of four lowland coastal areas located in Catalonia, Spain. The transition from development to conservation, and ifs reflection in planning and management practices is examined for each case in light of the social appraisal of coastal environments and processes as either resources or hazards. We conclude that this appraisal depends strongly on the historical trajectory of each area, the effectiveness of new legal and planning instruments, and the political will of institutions and social agents present in each area.

AB This article contrasts relatively disjointed federal policy dealing with the hurricane hazard with more coordinated federal policy dealing with earthquakes. A comparison between the two hazards is appropriate because of important similarities. However, significant differences between these disasters make the creation of national policy dealing with the hurricane hazard more difficult. These differences include distinctive features of the hurricane hazard and, in particular features of the policy community that works on the hurricane hazard. Differences between the earthquake and hurricane policy communities reveal the factors that inhibit policymaking. Prospects for a more comprehensive national policy to deal with the hurricane hazard are assessed.

AB Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Crete and to analyse the natural course of the untreated disease.
   Participants: Seventy-three patients (62 men) were enrolled in a prospective 4-year study. Clinical and virological parameters were recorded. Diagnosis was based on either ultrasound guided liver biopsy or a pathognomonic increase in alpha-fetoprotein plus compatible imaging.
   Methods: Statistical analysis was performed using histograms, contingency tables and one-way analyses of variance to analyse the characteristics of the disease. For survival analysis Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox's proportional hazards models were constructed.
   Results: HCC in Crete is a mostly male disease (7:1 male:female ratio) and unlike in mainland Greece, it is mostly a hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related disease (54% HCV positive as opposed to only 13% in mainland Greece). Prognosis was associated with Okuda classification (Okuda stage III patients have a relative risk of dying that is seven to nine times higher than for Okuda stage I), the presence or absence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). By contrast the presence of anti-HCV was not associated with a worse prognosis. A unit increase of albumin concentration was associated with an 11% decrease in the hazard rate.
   Conclusion: In general, Crete, despite the extremely similar population to the rest of Greece, resembles more closely the situation in Spain or Italy rather than mainland Greece.

AB Some of Earth's volcanoes - for example, those looming above the deserts of Ethiopia, Chad and Chile, or the polar seas of the Aleutians and Antarctica - seem almost as remote as those on Venus,Mars and Jupiter's moon, Io. Others, such as Vesuvio, provide the scenic backdrop to major cities. Even accessible volcanoes present areas that are difficult or risky to reach (for example, crater floors where much of the action takes place), hence the attraction of 'visiting' them by satellite rather than in person. Not only, can Earth observing satellites image an entire volcano or active lava flow almost instantaneously, they can, thanks to their-regular orbits, no so on a routine operational basis. In addition, their-sensors operate in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, offering a wide range of volcanological applications from thermal monitoring to ground deformation studies This article reviews these diverse capabilities Many of the methodologies described are generic, and equally relevant to oceanography, meteorology, land-cover mapping and so on. Aspects of volcanic hazard mitigation discussed here are also pertinent to natural disaster prevention in general.

AB Extreme flood events have been and continue to be one of the most important natural hazards responsible for deaths and economic losses. Extreme floods result in direct destructive effects during the time of the event, and they also may be followed by a related chain of indirect calamities such as famines and epidemics that produce additional damages and suffering. Extreme hydrological events that have occurred in the historical past may also occur in the future. Knowledge about magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of past extreme hydrological events in most regions are too short to adequately evaluate potential magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme hydrological events. Stationary climate in which the mean and variance do not change over time is a basic underlying assumption of standard methodological procedures for estimating recurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events. Palaeo-archives contained in river and lake sediments, fossil plant and animal matter, ice layers, and other natural archives show that the assumption of stationary climate is not valid when the time scale is extended beyond centuries and millennia. Records of past extreme floods that occurred long before the period of instrumentation can be reconstructed from the distribution of slackwater flood deposits or from derivation of water depths competent to transport the largest rocks found in flood deposited sediment. Palaeoflood records reconstructed from the Upper Mississippi and Lower Colorado River systems in the United States confirm nonstationary behaviour of the mean and variance in hydrological time series. These stratigraphic records have shown that even very modest climatic changes have resulted in very important changes in the magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme floods. A close relationship was found between the palaeo-flood record of extreme floods in the Upper Mississippi River system and a palaeo-record of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon preserved in speleothem calcite from a local cave. The relationship suggests that isotopic records elsewhere might be calibrated to provide insight about how future potential climate changes might impact extreme flood magnitudes and recurrence frequencies there. Atmospheric global circulation models (GCMs) mainly simulate average climatic conditions and are presently inadequate sources of information about how future climate changes might be represented at the extreme event scale. Palaeo-flood archives, however, provide basic information about how magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme hydrological events responded to past climate changes and they also provide a reference base against which GCM simulations can be calibrated regionally and be better interpreted to decipher hydrological information at the extreme event scale.

TI A new Peltier sensor for measuring the thermal conductivity of fluids
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PROPERTY
AB This paper describes a new sensor and method to measure the thermal conductivity of many fluids, The principal advantage of the sensor is self-compensation against temperatures brought about by an appropriate choice of materials. Moreover, because the sensor uses both the Peltier and Seebeck effects, measurements can be carried out with accuracy according to an average temperature increase of the device lower than 5 K. Operation of the device brings about a very low Joule power (5 mW). A coherent design rationale is formulated and the various stages in the technical development of the sensor are delineated. Several cases are discussed with a view toward increasing the applicability of the method. Notable applications include thermal conductivity gauges for measuring pressures in high-vacuum systems, tank gauging for liquids featuring fire hazards, and low-velocity measurements occurring in natural convection mechanisms, It is expected that the versatility of the device will result in a wide variety of industrial applications.

AB The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prognostic value of a single serum HIV-RNA measurement 6-24 months after HIV seroconversion, and to investigate whether any differences in outcome related to the clinical course of primary infection could be explained by presumed steady-state HIV-RNA levels at 6-24 months after seroconversion. Disease progression was analyzed by life tables and Cox proportional hazard models. A total of 93 HIV seroconverters followed for a median of 76 months (range, 19-143 months) were included in the study. The main outcome measures were development of AIDS stratified by age, the year of seroconversion, serum HIV-RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and duration of primary illness. The proportion of patients who developed AIDS was 36% (95% confidence interval, 22%-50%) at 8 years and 50% (26%-75%) at 10 years. In the unadjusted analyses, clinical progression was significantly associated with serum HIV-RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and duration of primary illness. The adjusted analyses indicated that HIV-RNA was the strongest predictor. Patients with long-lasting symptoms associated with primary infection had significantly higher serum HIV-RNA levels than those with less severe presentations (median counts, 11,660 vs. 2880 copies/ml, p = 0.001). It is concluded that the serum HIV-RNA level in early HIV infection is a strong independent predictor of clinical progression. Patients with long-lasting primary illnesses reach a higher viral load in steady state after seroconversion, which is probably the main reason for the poorer prognosis observed in this group of patients.

AB The poissonian and non-fractal characters generally exhibited by the most intense natural events do not allow the application of the current exponential and power law long-term hazard predictive models, and have suggested searching for a new model. This has been set up also taking into account that the random sequence (representing disorder) of these events is linked to the duration of the stationary small ones (representing order). The model, proposed in terms of the orbit of a simple non-linear hazard function, simulates the large eruptions of Vesuvius quite well and permits estimation of the next subplinian eruption to occur there around A.D. 2030. A short range forecasting model based on the tidal triggering is also provided and discussed. When large tidally triggered M-2 term in the earthquakes at Vesuvius become significant at the 0.01 level the proposed long-term hazard model will yield a more accurate estimate of the above prediction.

TI Landowners or lifeguards? Degel v Majestic Mobile Manor, Inc and
   liability for visitors' injuries from natural bodies of water
SO WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Under an exception to the attractive nuisance doctrine, landowners typically owe no duty to warn and protect trespassing children from the dangers inherent ill ponds, streams, and other natural bodies of water located on the owners' property. In Degel v. Majestic Mobile Manor, Inc, however, the Washington Supreme Court declined to extend this premises liability exception to situations where the injured visitor is an invitee of the landowner. This Note examines the natural bodies of water exception and argues that Degel's refusal to apply it in the invitee context ultimately conflicts with the court's earlier policy statement favoring access to the state's waterways. The Note concludes by proposing an analytical framework that would ensure the continued recreational, visual, and environmental benefits derived from unfenced bodies of water located on business property, while simultaneously maintaining a duty of affirmative care upon landowners to protect invitees from water hazards only under carefully limited circumstances.

TI Methods for predicting peak discharge of floods caused by failure of
   natural and constructed earthen dams
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTBURST FLOODS; LAKE; MAGNITUDE; DRAINAGE
AB Floods from failures of natural and constructed darns constitute a widespread hazard to people and property. Expeditious means of assessing hood hazards are necessary, particularly in the case of natural dams, which may form suddenly and unexpectedly. We revise statistical relations (derived from data for past constructed and natural dam failures) between peak discharge (Q(p)) and water volume released (V-0) or drop in lake level (d) but assert that such relations, even when cast into a dimensionless form, are of limited utility because they fail to portray the effect of breach-formation rate. We then analyze a simple, physically based model of dam-breach formation to show that the hydrograph at the breach depends primarily on a dimensionless parameter eta = kV(0)/g(1/2)d(7/2), where k is the mean erosion rate of the breach and g is acceleration due to gravity. The functional relationship between Q(p) and eta takes asymptotically distinct forms depending on whether eta less than or equal to 1 (relatively slow breach formation or small lake volume) or eta much greater than 1 (relatively fast breach formation or large lake volume). Theoretical predictions agree well with data from dam failures for which k, and thus eta, can be estimated. The theory thus provides a rapid means of predicting the plausible range of values of peak discharge at the breach in an earthen dam as long as the impounded water volume and the water depth at the dam face can be estimated.

AB Abietic acid, the major component of conifer oleoresin, is an environmental toxic molecule with potential hazard to animal and plant life. Being amphipatic, the study of its location and the interaction with membrane components is important to get insight into the mechanism of its toxic action. High resolution magic angle spinning natural abundance C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance studies have been undertaken in order to assess its location in egg yolk phosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles model membranes. C-13 spin-lattice relaxation times in the presence of Gd3+, a paramagnetic agent, of both the phospholipid and abietic acid molecules have been measured in order to obtain information on molecular distances (see J. Villalain, fur. J. Biochem. 241 (1996) 586-593). The molecule of abietic acid is placed in the upper part of the palisade structure of the membrane, its carboxyl group is in close proximity to the phospholipid ester groups and it does not extend beyond the C4/C7 carbons of the phospholipid molecule.

TI Conflict, the continuum and chronic emergencies: A critical analysis of
   the scope for linking relief, rehabilitation and development planning in
   Sudan
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of the 'relief-to-development continuum' has been the subject of renewed interest in recent years. Concerned by the rise in relief budgets over the past decade and the absolute fall in development aid resources, support has been growing for the concept of developmental relief In the context of complex political emergencies, it has been argued further that as effective development aid can reduce vulnerability to the impact of natural hazards, so it might also be used to contribute to a process of conflict prevention. In this way, the concept of the relief-development continuum has become entwined with broader discussions about the contribution of official development assistance to conflict management.
   Drawing on a Review of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), this paper cautions against uncritical application of the concept of the continuum in complex political emergencies, and of rehabilitation in particular, in the current Sudanese context. It argues that in order to move legitimately from relief aid programming to development aid programming, three fundamental conditions must be in place. first, a minimum level of security, respect for human rights and humanitarian access. Second, empirical evidence from the field needs to demonstrate that the emergency is over. Finally, moving from relief to development aid programming is contingent on donor governments accepting the legitimacy of national governmental structures and of the rebel movements. In other words, for donor governments, moving along the continuum is in significant part determined by foreign policy considerations, not only technical ones. Consideration needs to be given to the actual and perceived legitimation of the different movements that a move to rehabilitation might be seen to imply.
   The paper argues that none of these conditions had been satisfied in Sudan by mid-1997. instead of a process of normalisation paving the way to long-term development, the current situation in Sudan is better described as a chronic political emergency. In such a context, uncritical pursuit of developmental strategies may negatively affect the welfare of conflict-affected populations.

AB Objectives. We sought to determine the independent effect of preoperative symptoms on survival after surgical correction of aortic regurgitation (AR).
   Background. Aortic valve replacement for severe AR is recommended after Men York Heart Association functional class III or IV symptoms develop, However, whether severe preoperative symptoms have a negative influence an postoperative survival remains controversial.
   Methods. Preoperative characteristics and postoperative survival in 161 patients with functional class I or II symptoms (group 1) mere compared with those in 128 patients with class III or IV symptoms (group 2) undergoing surgical repair of severe isolated AR between 1980 and 1989.
   Results. Compared with group 1, group 2 patients were older (p < 0.0001), were more often female (p = 0.001) and more often had a history of hypertension (p = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (p (0.029) or myocardial infarction (p = 0.005) and mere more likely to require coronary artery bypass graft surgery (p < 0.0001). The operative mortality rate mas higher in group 2 (7.8%) than in group 1 (1.2%, p = 0.005), and the 10-year postoperative survival rate was worse (45% +/- 5% [group 2] vs, 78%; +/- 4% [group 1], p < 0.0001). Compared with age-and gender-matched control subjects, long-term postoperative survival was similar to that expected in group 1 (p = 0.14) but significantly worse in group 2 ip < 0.0001), On multivariate analysis, functional class III or IV symptoms mere significant independent predictors of operative mortality (adjusted odds ratio 5.5, p = 0.036) and worse long-term postoperative survival (adjusted hazard ratio 1.81, p = 0.0091).
   Conclusions. In the setting of severe AR, preoperative functional class III or IV symptoms are independent risk factors for excess immediate and long term postoperative mortality. The presence of class II symptoms should be a strong incentive to consider immediate surgical correction of severe AR. (C) 1997 by the American College of Cardiology.

AB Subtidal coastal sea level fluctuations affect coastal ecosystems and the consequences of destructive events such as tsunamis. We analyze a time series of subtidal fluctuations at Crescent City, California, during 1980-1991 using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). Our analysis shows that the variability in these fluctuations depends on the season for scales of 32 days and less. We show how the MODWT characterizes nonstationary behavior succinctly and how this characterization can be used to improve forecasts of inundation during tsunamis and storm surges. Pie provide pseudocode and enough details so that data analysts in other disciplines can readily apply MODWT analysis to other nonstationary time series.

AB To review the natural history of HIV infection in older women, a retrospective review of women enrolled in the HIV Outpatient Program based at the Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans was performed. Eighty-four of the women were at least 40 years of age. Older women were more likely to be diagnosed with selected psychosocial illnesses (e.g., injection drug use, alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, psychosis, dementia) compared with women <40 years of age, There was no association with age and other opportunistic processes or HIV-related symptoms, but cervical dysplasia and chlamydia cervicitis were less common in older women, In a multivariate proportional hazards model, characteristics predictive for death among older women included a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3) (relative risk [RR], 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18, 6.86; p <.02), a diagnosis of an opportunistic process (RR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.24, 8.55; p <.02), antiretroviral combination therapy (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12, 1.13; p <.08), and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.07, 1.10; p <.06). HRT should be considered in the management of postmenopausal HIV-infected women for its known documented benefits shown in populations of persons not infected with HIV. Prospective studies to better evaluate risks and benefits of HRT in HIV-infected women are warranted.

AB The relationship between macrovascular disease and blood glucose control in long-term follow-up of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is difficult to study because of the gradual rise in fasting plasma glucose due to ongoing beta-cell failure. We used time-dependent covariates in Cox's proportional hazards model to allow variables measured annually during a 10-year prospective follow-up to be related to risk of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. Data for 432 newly diagnosed diabetic patients were available, 112 of whom suffered mycardial infarction (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis of baseline measurements only gave relative hazards (95 % CL) of 1.04 (0.99, 1.09) per mmol l(-1) increase in fasting plasma glucose, 1.43 (1.12, 1.83) per decade increase in age and 1.07 (0.98, 1.17) per 10% increase in percentage of ideal weight. Analysis incorporating ongoing measurements gave corresponding figures of 1.07 (1.02, 1.12) for fasting plasma glucose, 1.64 (1.23, 2.20) for age and 1.06 (0.95, 1.18) for percentage of ideal weight. The risk of myocardial infarction while on insulin treatment 1.09 (0.58, 2.06) or oral agents 1.41 (0.86, 2.31) was not significantly elevated relative to dietary treatment. Baseline smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and previous myocardial infarction were also significant predictors of myocardial infarction. Similar relationships were found for cerebrovascular accident and total mortality. Increasing fasting plasma glucose is a significant independent predictor of macrovascular disease in diabetes.

TI Asymmetric information and the pricing of natural resources: The case of
   unmetered water
SO LAND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper uses mechanism design theory to propose a mechanism to price irrigation water when farmers are heterogeneous in their production technologies (adverse selection) and their individual water uses are unobserved (moral hazard). Unmetered irrigation water is often priced by imposing per-acre fees on cultivated acreage or by charging per-unit fees on observable inputs or outputs. The offered pricing procedure is based on the observed output and achieves a first-best outcome when implementation is free of transaction costs.

TI Impact of interferon beta-1a on neurologic disability in relapsing
   multiple sclerosis
SO NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY
AB Background and Objective: A phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) (Avonex, Biogen) significantly delayed progression of disability in relapsing MS patients. The primary clinical outcome was time from study entry until disability progression, defined as greater than or equal to 1.0 point worsening from baseline Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score persisting for at least two consecutive scheduled visits separated by 6 months. The objective of this study was to examine the magnitude of benefit on EDSS and its clinical significance. Methods: Post hoc analyses related to disability outcomes using data collected during the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial. Results: (1) Clinical efficacy related to disability did not depend on the definition of disability progression. A significant benefit iu favor of IFN beta-1a was observed when greater than or equal to 2.0 point worsening from baseline EDSS was required or when worsening was required to persist for greater than or equal to 1.0 year. (2) Placebo recipients who reached the primary clinical outcome worsened by a larger amount from baseline EDSS than did IFN beta-1a recipients who reached the primary study outcome. (3) Significantly fewer IFN beta-1a recipients progressed to EDSS milestones of 4.0 (relatively severe impairment) or 6.0 (unilateral assistance needed to walk). (4) Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that the only baseline characteristic strongly correlated with longer time to disability progression was IFN beta-1a treatment. Conclusions: The primary clinical outcome for the IFN beta-1a clinical trial underestimated clinical benefits of treatment. Results in this report demonstrate that IFN beta-1a treatment is associated with robust, clinically important beneficial effects on disability progression in relapsing MS patients.

AB Industrial-derived endocrine disrupters or endocrine-active chemicals (EACs) have been identified and hypothesized to play a role in human disease. Most of the xeno-EACs which have been characterized bind to the estrogen receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, or androgen receptor. Hazard and risk assessment of xeno-EACs is complicated by several factors which include the following: (i) humans are exposed to relatively high levels of natural EACs compared to xeno-EACs; (ii) very little information on the effects of metabolism, serum, and intracellular binding proteins on target cell uptake of EACs is known; (iii) humans are exposed to EAC mixtures and their interactive effects may be additive, antagonistic, or synergistic and also response-and tissue-specific; and (iv) individual EACs may be agonists/antagonists for more than one endocrine response pathway. Scientific-based hazard and risk assessment of both natural and xeno-EACs clearly requires more information on dietary intakes, target organ exposures, mechanisms of action, and interactive effects of mixtures.

AB The authors address the public health issues associated with the consumption of aquacultural products using numerous examples from the United States of America. As with other foods, public health risks exist but these mostly involve open water environments or products which are consumed raw or undercooked. Unlike wild fisheries, inland aquaculture systems can minimise public health risks by proper site evaluation and good aquacultural practices. Responsible use of pesticides and therapeutants can prevent violative residues to assure product safety and wholesomeness. The implementation of hazard analysis and critical control point regulations will further enhance the preventive approach to hazards control.
   The most challenging public health risks arise from shellfish production in open, surface waters, where both naturally-occurring and trace environmental residue contaminants can bioaccumulate in tissues and may cause disease outbreaks (and, in severe cases, death). Water quality certification programmes and field surveillance efforts including product sampling, testing and monitoring can address critical safety criteria. This paper focuses primarily on public health risks associated with production: however, the fact that consumer risks also occur as a result of the processing of aquacultural products and that foodborne diseases arise additionally from unsanitary handling or preparation and storage at incorrect temperatures (as is the case for food products from other animals) must also be taken into consideration.

TI Colorectal cancer risk in HNPCC families: Development during lifetime
   and in successive generations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; PATHOLOGY; FREQUENCY
AB Members of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) families develop colorectal cancer at a much higher rate, and at a much younger age, than the general population. To quantify lifetime colorectal cancer risk in HNPCC family members, we calculated the cumulative incidence (CI) in different age categories, and compared this to the general population. Furthermore, we investigated whether successive generations of HNPCC families had earlier onset of disease. In 51 HNPCC families, selected according to the ''Amsterdam criteria'', the CI of colorectal cancer at age 75 was 40%, compared to only 4% in the general population. The CI ratio (CIR) of HNPCC family members relative to the general population was 148 at age 40, 79 at age 50 and 11 at age 75, Comparing successive generations of HNPCC families, the CI at age 75 increases from 19% in the ancestors to 32% in the first generation and 55% in the second generation. However, Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that this generation effect (RR per generation: 1.8, 95% CL = 1.4-2.2) largely disappears after adjustment for year of birth. In summary, at young ages, HNPCC family members experience an up-to-150 times higher risk for colorectal cancer than the general population, This risk difference declines from age 60 onwards. The earlier age of onset in successive HNPCC generations does not appear to be a biological feature of HNPCC, but reflects a secular time trend in cancer occurrence in these families, similar to that in the general population.

AB Background: Duplex ultrasonography is considered a valid measure of stenosis of the carotid arteries, but the prognostic value of repeated ultrasonographic examinations is unknown.
   Objective: To determine the ability of serial ultrasonographic measurements to predict cerebrovascular events in patients with asymptomatic carotid disease.
   Design: Secondary analysis of data from a natural history study of asymptomatic carotid disease.
   Patients: Asymptomatic patients with cervical bruits.
   Measurements: Duplex ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was done at study enrollment and biannually thereafter. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models with fixed and time-dependent covariates were used for analysis.
   Results: 61 transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and 38 strokes occurred in 715 participants over a mean follow-up period of 3.2 years; 4 strokes were disabling, and no deaths from stroke occurred. Sixty percent of strokes occurred in persons who did not have severe stenosis. One fifth of; participants had stenosis progression. Baseline carotid stenosis was a significant predictor of the outcome ''TIA or stroke'' (relative risk, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2 to 1.7]) and retained its predictive ability for more than 3 years. Progression of stenosis to 80% or more significantly increased the risk for cerebrovascular events and death. The sensitivity and positive predictive Value of progression as an independent predictor of TIA or stroke were low.
   Conclusion: Severe carotid stenosis is associated with a higher risk for cerebrovascular events, but the power of repeated ultrasonography to predict ischemic events is limited by low incidence rates and low rates of progression. The evidence does not support the routine use of serial ultrasonography to determine the risk for stroke in unselected patients with asymptomatic carotid disease.

AB A variety of both lithotrophic and organotrophic microorganisms are known to mediate the mobilization of various elements from solids mostly by the formation of inorganic and organic acids. Under appropriate environmental conditions, metals are solubilized and extracted from metal-rich materials in subsurface ecosystems by the action of bacteria and fungi. In mine tailings or landfills microbial metal leaching represents a potential environmental hazard. However, these microbial activities can be successfully applied in the industry for the recovery of metals from solid materials such as ores or incineration residues. Microbial leaching processes are currently used for the winning of gold and copper from low-grade ores ('bioleaching'). Solid industrial waste materials such as fly ash, sludges, or dust might also be microbially treated to recover metals for the re-use in metal-manufacturing industries. Bioleaching allows the cycling of metals by a process close to natural biogeochemical cycles reducing the demand for resources such as ores, energy, or landfill space.

AB The aridity of the Arabian Peninsula's deserts ranges between arid to hyperarid with hot dry climate, scarce precipitation and sparse vegetation. These harsh environmental conditions enhance some geomorphologic processes more than others, cause specific geotechnical problems, and increase desertification.
   From west to east, the general physiography of Saudi Arabia shows the Red Sea coastal plains and the escarpment foothills called Tihama followed by the Arabian Shield mountains, the Arabian Shelf plateau and finally the Arabian Gulf coastal plains. Sand moves by wind either as drifting sand or migrating dunes in four major sand seas, over the Arabian Shelf, and in the inter-mountain valleys, in the Arabian Shield causing problems of erosion and deposition. Human activities in the deserts may cause more instability to the sand bodies, enlarging the magnitude of the problem. Fine silty soil particles also move by wind, depositing loess mainly in selected areas downwind in the Tihama. These loess deposits subside and may form earth fissures by the process of hydrocompaction upon wetting. The addition of water can be either natural through storms or man-made through human agricultural or civil activities. Extensive sabkhas exist along the coastal plains of both the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. The sabkha soil may also heave by salt re-crystallization or collapse by wetting. The shallow groundwater brines present in sabkhas also attack and corrode civil structures. Urbanization and excessive groundwater pumping may also deplete the fresh groundwater resources and may cause subsidence, ground fissuring and surface faulting as observed in some locations in the Arabian Shield. Although the average annual precipitation is very low, rain usually falls in the form of torrential storms, collected by dry valley basins and causing floods to unprotected downstream areas on the coastal plains of the Red Sea.
   The desert environment, being a fragile echo system, needs to be treated with care. Intercommunications between different national and international agencies and education of the layman should help to keep the system balanced and reduce the resulting environmental hazards. In addition, any suggested remedial measures should be planned with nature and engineered with natural materials.

AB Seismotectoniclly, Hong Kong is located in the Southeast China Outer Seismic Zone. It is regarded as an ar ea exposed to seismic risk of mild-intermediate level. This paper provides a new result of seismic hazard assessment for Hong Kong. The probabilistic seismic hazard analysis has been performed for Hong Kong based on the new, geological and seismological dataset collected from China and international sources. The computation result obtained in this study indicates that the peak ground acceleration in Hong Kong region is in the range of 86-105 gal, corresponding to 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years. This result can be used as a basic reference for Hong Kong's natural disaster reduction planning.

AB This study uses data from in-depth and focus group interviews conducted with African-American farmers residing in four southern states (Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee) to discuss the occupational prevention knowledge and behaviors found among these farmers, and to identify the major occupational health risks of which they are not aware. These African-American farmers have substantial knowledge about occupational injury prevention. Prevention knowledge and behaviors among these farmers are organized into several themes, including general prevention behaviors, and specific actions related to machinery, chemicals and livestock. Significant gaps also remain in their prevention knowledge in the operation of equipment, precautions needed in working with animals, and avoiding hazards in the built and natural environments. These farmers acknowledge disregarding some safety rules. They have not implemented some preventive procedures because they do not want to change old habits or because they cannot pay for new equipment.

AB A methodological framework for the determination of environmental quality in coastal areas is presented. The method is based on the identification of a series of characteristics (e.g. water quality, hazard level, potential for use) which can be used to describe different environmental components (e.g. coastal waters, natural hazards, human features) using certain indicators (e.g. ppm of selected pollutants, number of storms per year, number and quality of historical sites). Numerical indices which can be used to assess different qualities on the basis of the indicators are proposed. These indices can be applied to both ''natural'' environmental units and coastal jurisdictions and they can be used for mapping environmental quality and monitoring its change with time. A conservation/development diagram is proposed as a tool to help identify and assess planning conflicts in coastal areas.
   The method proposed should facilitate the integration of scientific assessments into the process of coastal planning and management, through the application of indices which summarize environmental characteristics in terms significant for planners. It can also help to determine whether existing management and policy trends move away or towards sustainability, as the indices provide a means to determine whether environmental quality in a coastal area is decreasing or increasing.

AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women can be influenced by endogenous and exogenous hormones. For both sexes, the risk of CVD shows a linear increase with age, but at all ages CVD is less frequent in women than in men. Menopause influences risk factors for CVD because it increases total serum cholesterol by 2-20% and triglycerides by 7-35%, independent of age, while it is also associated with significant increases in antithrombin III, factor VII coagulant activity VIIc and plasma fibrinogen. After menopause, an increase in the waist-hip ratio can be observed. However; menopause is not known to have an effect on blood pressure. Surgical menopause as well as early natural menopause are therefore independent risk factors for cardiovascular mortality. Each year of delayed menopause represents a 2% reduction in the annual hazard of death due to CVD. The effect of early menopause may be more important at younger ages. Numerous studies on the effect of exogenous hormones and the risk of CVD have shown a 30-50% reduction of CVD in estrogen users. The main problem when attempting to interpret these observations is that the effect of selection and compliance bias is unknown to us. Randomized trials are therefore still needed to justify, primary and secondary prevention achieved by estrogen administration in postmenopausal women. The effect of estrogens, or progestin, or both on the risk of CVD have been reported. Estrogens alone or combined with progestin improve the serum lipoprotein profile and lower fibrinogen levels, but their effects on clinical outcome are still unknown.

AB Risk assessment is the process of estimating the likelihood that an adverse effect may result from exposure to a specific health hazard. The process traditionally involves hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization to answer ''How many excess cases of disease A will occur in a population of size B due to exposure to agent C at dose level D?'' For natural hazards, however, we modify the risk assessment paradigm to answer ''How many excess cases of outcome Y will occur in a population of size B due to natural hazard event E of severity D?'' Using a modified version involving hazard identification, risk factor characterization, exposure characterization, and risk characterization, we demonstrate that epidemiologic modeling and measures of risk can quantify the risks from natural hazard events. We further extend the paradigm to address mitigation, the equivalent of risk management, to answer ''What is the risk for outcome Y in the presence of prevention intervention X relative to the risk for Y in the absence of X?'' We use the preventable fraction to estimate the efficacy of mitigation, or reduction in adverse health outcomes as a result of a prevention strategy under ideal circumstances, and further estimate the effectiveness of mitigation, or reduction in adverse health outcomes under typical community-based settings. By relating socioeconomic costs of mitigation to measures of risk, we illustrate that prevention effectiveness is useful for developing cost-effective risk management options.

ID BENGAL
AB The reclamation of Sagar island from the Sundarban mangrove wetlands of the western Ganga Brahmaputra delta was initiated in 1811. At present the island is almost wholly settled. The major natural environmental hazards (NEH) that affect the island are tropical cyclones, coastal erosion, tidal ingression and dunal encroachment. Human adjustments to these problems include acceptance, technological control, relocation, regulation and emergency measures. Seven different agencies manage the existing NEH-prevention projects of the island, often with little coordination. Important schemes managed by these agencies include coastal and interior embankments, mangrove plantations, storm refuges, resettlement projects and vegetation wind-breaks. Their efficiency ranges from excellent to very poor. Since a large outlay is inconceivable, the island's hazard prevention projects should mobilise existing resources in a more rational and coordinated manner. The long-term solution to the problems, however, lies in an accelerated socio-economic development of the region.

TI Simulation of coastal oil spills using the random walk particle method
   with Gaussian kernel weighting
SO SPILL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB Oil spills, amongst the most common marine hazards, are a major community concern, particularly in coastal areas where there are competing requirements due to population centres, conservation of the natural environment, industrial development and transport. It has become common practice to include simulations and modelling exercises in applications for development, so that oil spill trajectory studies are regularly carried out for planning and assessment purposes as well as for making decisions in the event of actual incidents. In this paper we present a procedure for the simulation of coastal oil spills which uses the random walk particle method with Gaussian kernel weighting to simulate the movement of oil in the sea, and includes special beaching and refloating algorithms for shorelines. This procedure allows one to simulate coastal spills rapidly and accurately and to perform calculations at closed boundaries consisting of a variety of shoreline types such as exposed headlands, sand beaches, sheltered marshes, etc., and at open boundaries with an extended computational region. Moreover, the mass concentration of the spill can be calculated at any point of a finite diffusion domain and conveniently represented by contour and mesh plots. Simulations in a typical coastal region are presented to illustrate the procedure for spills from instantaneous point sources, instantaneous line sources, instantaneous area sources, continuous point sources and continuous moving sources.

AB In order to determine the nature and extent of the problem caused by the presence of mercury in the environment of the James Bay territory a Mercury Agreement was signed in 1986 jointly by the Crees, the Government of Quebec and Hydro-Quebec. The objectives were to minimize potential hazards to human health arising from the presence of mercury in the environment, to alleviate negative impacts on the Crees, their way of life and their harvesting activities and to provide for remedial measures. Monitoring of mercury concentrations in fish show that, 15 years after impounding of La Grande-2 reservoir, the concentrations remain higher in reservoirs than in natural lakes but they are now deceasing in both predatory (Northern pike) and non-predatory (Whitefish) fishes. Monitoring of the mercury exposure among the Crees showed that concentrations in hair have decreased and are now stabilized, for most of the population, to concentrations that do not present a health risk. This decrease may be attributed to a reduction in fish consumption and/or a possible switch of the diet towards non-piscivorous fish, less contaminated by mercury.

AB Acquisition of a capability for unambiguous classification of earthquakes near a new reservoir into the twin categories of reservoir-induced and natural tectonic earthquakes is still of considerable practical importance from the seismic hazards point of view. We show how this classification may be carried out in the general 3D case by focussing attention on the perturbation of frictional stability of the causative fault of an earthquake under the influence of the reservoir. We suggest that an earthquake may be put in the induced category only if the reservoir-induced stresses and pore pressure actively promote frictional failure on the fault in the same sense as does the ambient shear stress acting on the fault at the time of occurrence of the earthquake. We consider the case of the main Koyna earthquake of December 10, 1967, to illustrate the application of these ideas. We find that it may have been induced by the Koyna reservoir with pore pressure playing a prominent role in lowering fault stability.

AB Heat stress is an obvious hazard, and mechanisms to recover from thermal damage, largely unknown as of yet, have evolved in all organisms. We have recently shown that a marker protein in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, denatured by exposure of cells to 50 degrees C after preconditioning at 37 degrees C, was reactivated by an ATP-dependent machinery, when the cells were returned to physiological temperature 24 degrees C. Here we show that refolding of the marker enzyme Hsp15 Delta-beta-lactamase, inactivated and aggregated by the 50 degrees C treatment, required a novel ER-located homologue of the Hsp70 family, Lhs1p. In the absence of Lhs1p, Hsp150 Delta-beta-lactamase failed to be solubilized and reactivated and was slowly degraded. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggested that Lhs1p was somehow associated with heat-denatured Hsp150 Delta-beta-lactamase, whereas no association with native marker protein molecules could be detected. Similar findings were obtained for a natural glycoprotein of S. cerevisiae, pro-carboxypeptidase Y (pro-CPY). Lhs1p had no significant role in folding or secretion of newly synthesized Hsp150 Delta-beta-lactamase or pro-CPY, suggesting that the machinery repairing heat-damaged proteins may have specific features as compared to chaperones assisting de novo folding. After preconditioning and 50 degrees C treatment, cells lacking Lhs1p remained capable of protein synthesis and secretion for several hours at 24 degrees C, but only 10% were able to form colonies, as compared to wild-type cells. We suggest that Lhs1p is involved in a novel function operating in the yeast ER, refolding and stabilization against proteolysis of heat-denatured protein. Lhs1p may be part of a fundamental heat-resistant survival machinery needed for recovery of yeast cells from severe heat stress.

AB A survey of the occurrence of microcystin-containing cyanobacterial blooms in the freshwaters of Brittany was made in September 1994. Twenty-nine sites, including rivers, ponds and reservoirs were studied. Cyanobacteria were present in twenty-five sites. The microcystin content of twenty-two natural samples and nineteen Microcystis aeruginosa strains isolated from six samples was investigated using HPLC analysis. Most of the bloom samples were dominated by M. aeruginosa spe cies. More than 70 % of the samples collected from the water bodies contained microcystins. microcystin-LR was the main microcystin found. The microcystin content varied generally from undetectable to 0.73 mg g(-1) (freeze-dried cells). Only one sample contained a high concentration of microcystins, 4 mg g(-1). Both microcystin-containing and microcystin-non-containing strains were found in cyanobacteria cultures isolated from natural samples. Microcystin content in isolated strains ranged from undetectable to 0.81 mg g(-1).
   This study showed for the first time that microcystin-containing cyanobacteria are frequent in the freshwaters of Brittany. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the cyanobacterial developments in this region to prevent human health hazards.

AB Earthquakes, tropical cyclones and floods are the most important natural perils in terms of human deaths on a global basis. In Australia, at least 4300 deaths in the last 200 years have been produced by heat waves; about 2000-2200 each by tropical cyclones and floods; and bushfires and lightning strikes have each killed at least 650 people. On a global basis it appears that floods, tropical storms, droughts and earthquakes are the most damaging natural perils. In Australia, in terms of median damage per event, hailstorms are the most expensive insured natural peril, while three events-the 1989 Newcastle earthquake, 1974's Cyclone Tracy, and the 1990 Sydney hailstorm-produced 36 per cent of the total insured damage in the period since 1967. The Newcastle earthquake and the Sydney hailstorm have provided opportunities for new understandings of these perils and their consequences. While much has been learnt from the devastation of Rabaul town by the 1994 eruption, a rare opportunity for a detailed study of building damage has been lost. Without detailed studies, risk rating, where Risk = Hazard (or peril) x Vulnerability, is difficult.

AB Phenanthrene (PHE) undergoes a significant increase in toxicity after exposure to simulated or natural sunlight in aqueous media, coincident with the appearance of PHE photoproducts. To investigate whether the primary photoproduct of PHE, 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PHEQ), contributes to the increased hazards of solutions containing photomodified PHE,toxicity assays were conducted using the marine bacteria Photobacterium phosphoreum and the aquatic plant Lemna gibba (duckweed). Photo-bacterium phosphoreum was exposed to PHE, PHEQ, a photomodified PHE mixture containing known amounts of PHE and PHEQ (pmPHE), and a mixture mimicking the amounts of PHE and PHEQ in the pmPHE mixture. The bacteria were found to be equally sensitive to PHE in simulated solar radiation (SSR, a light source with a visible light:UVA:UVB ratio similar to that of sunlight) or darkness, with an EC50 of 0.53 mg/L. In both darkness or SSR, solutions containing PHEQ (with or without PHE) all exhibited an EC50 of 0.06 to 0.10 mg/L based on PHEQ concentrations, indicating that PHEQ was the primary active component of the pmPHE mixture. Lemna gibba was tested in SSR and visible light with PHE, PHEQ, and the pmPHE mixture. The calculated EC50 for PHE was 3.5 mg/L in SSR and 10.8 mg/L in visible light, showing that the presence of UV radiation in the SSR source increased the phytotoxicity of PHE. Strikingly, PHEQ was much more toxic to L. gibba than PHE ina light-independent manner (an EC50 of 0.53 and 0.57 mg/L PHEQ in dark and SSR, respectively). Thus, for both P. phosphoreum and L. gibba the major photooxidation product of PHE in SSR, PHEQ, is the more toxic of the two chemicals.

AB The estimation of modern soil erosion on agricultural lands in Russia is given. It is made on the basis of small-scale maps of erosion hazard using quantitative models of soil loss. The general regularities of soil loss on slopes and the factors controlling this process are revealed. A scheme of soil-erosion regionalization of the Russian territory based on the spatial analysis of soil erosion as a natural-anthropogenic phenomenon managed by technological, economical, and social aspects of land use is suggested.

SO EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB The methods of assessing soil loss tolerance as a quantitative standard for evaluating the erosion hazard are considered. The majority of methods take into account natural processes (normal erosion) as well as economical and environmental considerations. The most accurate, although not easily realizable, approach is the evaluation of permissible soil loss by the rate of soil formation. The method of ''equilibrium profile'' is proposed as an alternative to the existing approaches. This method is based on the assumption that there is a zone on the slope where the rate of erosion is equal to the rate of pedogenesis. Thus, soil loss tolerance can be assessed by measuring the erosion truncation in this zone.

AB Clinical decisions in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) depend upon understanding its variable natural history, Several prognostic models for survival have been developed, We explored the Child-Pugh Classification (CPC) to determine if it predicts survival as well, as a disease-specific model (DSM). We identified 208 PSC patients who satisfied established criteria Prognostic variables were measured from the first visit. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were obtained for CPC twice, once censoring observations at orthotopic liver transplantation and again considering opthotopic liver transplantation as a failure. A stepwise Cox proportional hazards-model was used to identify the factors associated with mortality. For 208 patients, the mean follow-up was 70 months (SD + 55), Kaplan-Meier 7-year survivals for CPC A, B, and C were 89.8%, 68%, and 24.9%, respectively (P < .001). The Cox model identified CPC and age as the most significant predictors of mortality. Adding the DSM risk score did not significantly improve the fit of the model (P = .75). The following were concluded: 1) CPC is a powerful predictor of survival in PSC; 2) DSM does not enhance the predictive ability of CPC; and 3) CPC may be used as an alternative to the DSM in research studies and clinical decision-making.

AB Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a reasonably well-defined clinicopathological entity; it has been reported more commonly in women than in men or children of both sexes and it appears to be most closely associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus and related abnormalities, such as hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. However, the association with female gender, obesity and diabetes may not be as close as suggested by the literature and an underlying condition cannot be discerned in all cases. The natural history of the disease is poorly understood; the associated biopsy features span a wide spectrum, reaching from uncomplicated, clinically non-progressive fatty liver (not NASH in a strict sense) to a slowly progressive fatty liver with inflammation and fibrosis, to steatohepatitis with submassive hepatic necrosis, which has a subfulminant course and is often fatal. Non-progressive fatty liver appears to be very common but is of little clinical importance. The slowly progressive form of the disease represents NASH as encountered by most clinicians and pathologists. It is a common liver disease in current practice; patients may present with cirrhosis and even HCC arising from steatohepatitic cirrhosis. Subfulminant NASH has become exceedingly rare because many clinicians are now aware of the hazards of sudden weight loss, particularly in morbidly obese patients. Treatment options for NASH are still limited. The promotion of gradual weight loss in obese patients is the most widely recommended therapy but, unfortunately, this is very difficult to achieve. Avoidance of precipitous weight loss and careful control of diabetes mellitus are important and undisputed parts of patient management. Administration of UDCA as a treatment of NASH is still under study; it may be effective in some patients. The treatment of established steatohepatitic cirrhosis does not differ substantially from that of other types of cirrhosis and includes orthotopic liver transplantation.

DE drought; perception; marginal environments; content analysis; ranching
AB Drought exacts a heavy toll on agricultural productivity, yet it has been largely defined as a one-dimensional natural hazard. This paper explores an understanding and defining of drought based on the perception of ranchers in the marginal physical environment of western South Dakota. Analysis of interview data reveals at least four separate dimensions of drought: (1) when a percentage of normal rainfall is received, (2) when ranch operation is affected, (3) when a definite amount of rainfall is received, and (4) the timeliness of rainfall. The incorporation of perception-based data with site-specific drought severity indices, such as the Palmer Index, can provide a more complete characterization of a hazard affecting the productivity and sustainability of semiarid environments worldwide.

   (ultisols); biomass management
AB African tropical mountains are often overcrowded because the climate is healthy and favorable to intensive agriculture. Consequently the density of population in the mountains of Rwanda and Burundi has reached an exceptional level (150 to 800 inhabitants/km(2)) that leads to delicate problems of soil protection against runoff and various types of erosion on steep cultivated hillslopes. Previous measurements on runoff plots have shown that sheet and rill erosion risks have reached 300 to 700 t/ha/year on 20 to 60% slopes with regional rainfall erosivity (R-usa = 250 to 700), very resistant ferrallitic soils (K = 0.01 to 0.20) and traditional farming systems (C = 0.8 to 0.3). Curiously, the runoff rate (10 to 30%) is relatively moderate so that it is possible to restrict erosion with a natural or leguminous fallow, a pine plantation (litter effect) or by mulching coffee, banana or cassava plantations. The problem is now to produce enough biomass to mulch the whole surface with the help of agroforestry. A new strategy (GCES = land husbandry) was suggested to meet the major farmer problems: what should be done to increase the soil productivity rapidly and protect the rural environment? A part of the answer is to be found in the efficient management of water, organic matter and soil fertility restoration (Roose et al., 1988). This strategy was first tested in 9 runoff plots (5 x 20 m) on a 23% slope of a very acid ferrallitic soil (pH = 4). Three types of living hedges (leucaena, calliandra, calliandra + setaria) twice replicated, were compared with the international bare standard plot and with the regional farming system (maize + beans during the first season, and sorghum during the second season). After 2 years, living hedges reduced runoff to less than 2% and erosion to 2 t/ha/year: they produced fire wood and high quality leguminous forage (3 to 8 kg/m) and return to the soil as much as 80 to 120 kg/ha/year of nitrogen, 3 kg/ha/year of phosphorus, 30 to 60 kg/ha/year of calcium and potassium, 10 to 20 kg/ha/year of magnesium. Thanks to agroforestry it was possible to reduce erosion hazard but not to restore the soil productivity. Without 2.5 t/ha/3 years of lime to increase the pH up to 5 and reduce the aluminium toxicity, without 10 t/ha/2 years of farm manure and mineral fertilizers to nourish the crops, the yield remains very low (800 kg/ha/season of cereals). Thanks to agroforestry and a mineral fertilizer complementation, erosion hazard was controlled and the productivity of soil and labour intensified more than 3 times.

AB Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV infections share risk factors; therefore, coinfection is common. Interactions have been reported but controlled studies have been limited. Our objective was to study the effect of HIV infection on the natural history of chronic HBV infection and the reverse effect of the HBV carrier state on HIV infection.
   Design: Prospective observational cohort study.
   Setting: Open-access outpatient HIV/genitourinary medicine clinic at a Central London hospital.
   Patients: Total of 152 untreated homosexual male HBV carriers and 212 HBV surface antigen-negative controls (41.4 and 70.3% HIV-seropositive, respectively).
   Outcome measures: The rate of loss of serum HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and its reappearance in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected HBV carriers; serum HBV DNA levels (measured by dot-blot hybridization assay), HBV DNA polymerase activity and liver transaminase activities; the progression of HIV infection to symptomatic disease or AIDS in HIV-infected compared with HBV-HIV coinfected patients.
   Results: In HIV-infected HBV carriers, serum HBV DNA polymerase activity was higher, alanine aminotransferase was lower and loss of serum HBeAg (mean followup, 2.8 years) occurred at a lower rate when compared with HIV-uninfected HBV carriers (estimated relative hazard, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.161-0.942). Concomitant chronic HBV infection had no detectable effect on the rate of progression of HIV disease after correction for lead-time bias.
   Conclusion: This study strengthens the evidence for a significant effect of HIV. infection on the natural history of chronic HBV infection, which by prolonging the period of infectivity could have an important impact on the epidemiology of HBV infection in regions, or patient groups, with high HIV seroprevalence. There was no evidence of an important effect of HBV carriage on HIV disease progression.

AB PURPOSE: As Western populations live longer, peripheral vascular disease will become a greater individual and public health problem. Therefore, the long-term natural history of intermittent claudication (IC) needs further delineation. The study objective was to describe the 21-year mortality and relative risk for cause-specific mortality for subjects with incident IC.
   METHODS: The subjects were 8343 Israeli male governmental employees aged 40-65 years who were free of coronary heart disease and symptomatic peripheral vascular disease in 1963. These men were followed for 21 years to measure differences in mortality between those who did and did not develop incident IC. Incident IC was diagnosed In 1965 and 1968 by the London School of Hygiene IC Questionnaire. All other cardiovascular disease risk factors were measured by standardized and validated procedures. Cause-specific mortality through 1986 was determined through death certificates from the Israeli Mortality Register.
   RESULTS: A total of 360 men with IC and 7983 symptom-free men were followed for survival from 1965 to 1986; 159 men with IC (44%) and 2330 syptom-free men (29%) died. For total mortality, the Kaplan-Meier 21-year survival probabilities were 56% for IC and 71% for symptom-free men (P < 0.0001 for the entire 21-year survival difference between the two groups). For coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and other causes of death, the survival probabilities for men with IC and symptom-free men were, respectively: 85% vs. 90%, 89% vs. 97%, and 79% vs. 83% (P = 0.0004; P < 0.0001; and P = 0.007, respectively, for the entire 21-year survival difference between the two groups). Cox's proportional hazards model was used to control confounding from incident myocardial infarction and angina through 1968, as well as for demographic, physiologic, psychosocial, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The 21-year adjusted all-cause mortality relative risk for IC was 1.50 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.77). For stroke deaths the relative risk was 2.76 (95% CI, 1.89-4.02). For stroke mortality, IC was the third strongest predictor of death after elevated systolic blood pressure and increasing age. Incident IC had a relative risk of CHD deaths of 1.31, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.97-1.77). IC was not statistically significantly related to other causes of death (P = 0.10) after adjustment for covariates.
   CONCLUSIONS: IC is strongly predictive of long-term cerebrovascular disease mortality among men. Incident IC is a stronger indicator of cerebrovascular than of CHD death. (C) 1997 by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The effect of the surfactant dodecyl alkyl sulphate (C(12)AS) on the structure and function of lotic protistan assemblages was examined using the Experimental Stream Facility (ESF) operated by the Procter and Gamble Company. Population- and community-level responses to C(12)AS were monitored on introduced substrates placed in the channels 28 days prior to dosing (mature communities) as well as those placed in the channels on day 0 of dosing (immature communities), to allow for a broad assessment of the effect of the chemical on processes contributing both to community development and maintenance. C(12)AS appeared to elicit a subsidy response from the native protistan assemblage which may have resulted from both positive and negative responses at trophic levels above and below the assemblage. Protistan responses to the surfactant tended to occur more rapidly and be more sensitive than those documented for invertebrates and fish. C(12)AS elicited a modest response (i.e. a 20% change) from several reliable parameters including community respiration (reduced dissolved oxygen at 289 mu g per L), protozoan species richness (increased at 63 mu g per L) and protozoan community composition (increased dissimilarity at 1254 mu g per L). Responses to C(12)AS exceeded expected exposures in the real world by a factor of six or greater thereby indicating that the hazard of exposure to C(12)AS to stream communities is low The results of this study support the use of mesocosms as decisive tools for evaluating the hazard posed by consumer product chemicals to natural communities and ecosystems.

AB Belews Lake, North Carolina, was contaminated by selenium in wastewater released from a coal-fired electric generating facility during 1974-1985, Selenium bioaccumulated in aquatic food chains and caused severe reproductive failure and teratogenic deformities in fish, Beginning in 1986, the electric utility company changed its ash disposal practices and selenium-laden wastewater no longer entered the lake, A survey of selenium present in the water, sediments, benthic invertebrates, fish, and aquatic birds was conducted in 1996, Concentrations were compared to pre-1986 levels to determine how much change occurred during the decade since selenium inputs stopped, The data were also examined using a hazard assessment protocol to determine if ecosystem-level hazards to fish and aquatic birds had changed as well, Results reveal that waterborne selenium fell from a peak of 20 mu g/liter before 1986, to <1 mu g/liter in 1996; concentrations in biota were 85-95% lower in 1996, Hazard ratings indicate that high hazard existed prior to 1986 and that moderate hazard is still present, primarily due to selenium in the sediment-detrital food pathway, Concentrations of selenium in sediments have fallen by about 65-75%, but remain sufficiently elevated (1-4 mu g/g) to contaminate benthic food organisms of fish and aquatic birds, Field evidence confirmed the validity of the hazard ratings, Developmental abnormalities in young fish indicate that selenium-induced teratogenesis and reproductive impairment are occurring, Moreover, the concentrations of selenium in benthic food organisms are sufficient to cause mortality in young bluegill and other centrarchids because of Winter Stress Syndrome, At the ecosystem level, recovery has been slow, Toxic effects are still evident 10 years after selenium inputs were stopped, The sediment-associated selenium will likely continue to be a significant hazard to fish and aquatic birds for years.

AB The authors investigated whether host immunity contributes to the development of asynchronous distant metastases in colorectal carcinomas, The host immunity was examined 8 times, pre-and postoperatively during a one gear period in 77 curatively operated cases, A prospective study a-as performed using obtained personal data, During the mean follow-up period of 920 days, 13 patients developed distant metastases, Among the immunological parameters, the preoperative natural killer (NK) cell activity differed significantly between the metastases positive and negative groups, On univariate analysis, dichotomous NK activity presence of nodal metastases, and venous invasion correlated with metastases. The hazard ratios on multivariate analysis were 4.53, 3.82, and 4.81, respectively, No correlation was noted between NK activity and the progression stages of colorectal carcinomas, These data suggested that attenuated preoperative NK activity is an important background factor for the development of asynchronous distant metastases following curative resection of colorectal carcinomas.

AB Semeru volcano (3676 m), the highest volcano in Java, is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. Its activity has occurred almost continuously since 1967. The activity is manifested by mostly Strombolian-type eruptions with lava extrusions which extend into a lava tongue in Kobokan breach, southeast slope of the volcano. The lava tongue is unstable. After reaching a certain volume the tongue collapses and causes pyroclastic flows to the southeast direction, traveling a maximum of about 11 km downslope. The collapse is sometimes triggered by volcanic eruptions. The main dangers are not due to eruption and collapse of the lava tongue but caused by the secondary dangers. The secondary dangers are more destructive and distributed over a wider area, tens of kilometres from the source. The natural hazards in the Semeru region are not only related to volcanic activity, which is so-called lahar, but also non-volcanic processes such as debris flow. This phenomenon is related to the heavy rainfall, which causes landslides in the altered volcanic deposit areas. The how of the mixture of water and landslide materials has devastated large areas. The occurrences of the secondary flow is unpredictable and its viscosity is much lower than lahar. This flow is distributed over a wide area and threatens cultivated land and densely populated and developing urban areas. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Designing for climate variability
SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Hurricanes, blizzards, and floods. The atmosphere has visited extreme weather in the United States over the last five years. Is this climate change or climatic variability? Is the distinction important in the context of infrastructure design and planning? To address these questions, the meaning and relevance of the notions of climate change and climate variability must be clearly established in the context of natural hazards, and infrastructure engineering. Multidecadal time scales (whether natural or anthropogenically induced) have been firmly identified in the climate record. Compelling evidence of this variability has been found in data sources as diverse as tree rings, and cores taken from coral reefs, sediments, and glaciers across the globe. It is therefore submitted that the criteria used in engineering design of lifeline infrastructures, land-use planning, and water resources management among others must incorporate this knowledge.

DT Article
DE flood geomorphology; India; hydrology; cyclonic storms; human activity
ID RIVER; NARMADA
AB This paper provides a brief outline of the flood studies in India in the field of geomorphology, meteorology and hydrology. The review clearly shows that, though the general characteristics of floods have been known for a long time, our scientific understanding of the floods remains incomplete to a surprisingly large extent. Existing studies seem to concentrate in two areas. The first deals with hydrometeorological analysis of flood producing rainfall and associated synoptic conditions. The second area is related to streamflow analysis and the estimation of design floods. Both the research areas place considerable emphasis on statistical analysis and modelling. This trend is likely to continue in future. While a quantitative approach to the problem is indispensable in predictive models, it is felt that future opportunities to improve our understanding of this recurring natural hazard should include research into the natural trends and the behaviour of floods on longer time scale, and increased evaluation of the impact of anthropogenic activities on the river systems.

AB Most radio astronomical observations are affected to some degree by man-made and natural interference. There are a few avoidance techniques that can reduce the impact of interference an the survey, but we must make quite significant advances in the understanding of our antennas and receivers and the interference itself before a substantial improvement can be expected. A major increase in the efficiency of future surveys will likely come from phased-array feeds, which have the potential for much closer beam spacings, greater antenna efficiency, and wider fields of view than current independent-feed arrays.

TI Sand drift encroachment in the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes District and its

SO SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Mogao Grottoes; gobi wind-sand stream; sand dune migration
AB Analysis on sand drift damages to the Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes showed that the actual sand drift hazards in the area are mainly attributed to the gobi wind-sand stream formed by sand coming from the Mingsha Mountain (megadune), while the migration of the megadune and its frontal edge dunes is actually not a major threat to the grottoes. The gobi belt on the cliff top of the Mogao Grottoes is not only a natural sand transport field but also a natural protective screen which prevents the megadune and its frontal edge dunes from advancing towards the grottoes or burying the grottoes. Therefore efforts to protect the Mogao Grottoes should be focussed on halting the gobi wind-sand stream rather than on checking the migration of sand dunes. For this reason, effective sand blockade and stabilization measures should be adopted at the frontal edge of the megadune but no sand retarding works are allowed to be set up in the gobi belt so as to avoid sand accumulation and entering the grottoes.

DE farming; stress; job stress
ID WOMEN
AB The experience of job-related stress was studied in 318 UK farmers. Of the job-related stress domains investigated, comparatively high amounts of stress were reported as a result of governmental regulation and its resulting bureaucracy, and relatively low amounts of stress resulted from feelings of isolation. Six major domains of stress emerged for farmers: farming bureaucracy, finance, isolation, uncontrollable natural forces, personal hazards and time pressure. The scores on different farming-related stress scales were compared across the sexes, ages and types of farm. In general, women reported more stress than men. Mixed-type and dairy farmers reported the highest levels of stress from time pressure, and cereals farmers the lowest. Livestock farmers had more financial stress than dairy and cereals farmers. Age lessened the stress reported from all aspects of farming except bureaucracy. The psychometric instrument developed in the present study - the Edinburgh Farming Stress Inventory - should be validated in other farming settings and in more representative samples of farmers.

AB Objective: To identify the predictors of acquiring cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, and to describe natural history, therapeutic management and autopsy findings in affected patients.
   Design: Observational study of a consecutive cohort of AIDS patients diagnosed and followed in the same institution.
   Methods: All of the patients with CMV disease were included. Statistical analyses were performed to establish the risk of acquiring the disease at or after AIDS presentation, survival, and the occurrence and lime of relapses in relation to maintenance therapy. The presence of CMV infection at autopsy was also investigated.
   Results: CMV disease was diagnosed in 304 (24.8%) out of 1227 patients, its incidence increasing according to the year of AIDS diagnosis. Women, homosexual men, patients given zidovudine and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis before AIDS, and severely immunodepressed patients were at higher risk for the disease. CMV disease was an independent factor of worse survival (hazard ratio, 1.7 versus PCP; 95% confidence intervals, 1.28-2.13). Patients untreated during the acute phase had a 4.3 higher risk of dying than those treated. Relapses occurred less frequently and later in patients given continuous maintenance treatment (23 out of 113; 17 months) than in untreated patients (13 out of 16; 3 months) or those given discontinuous therapy (22 out of 40; 7 months), whereas survival was independent from treatment. CMV infection was found in 97 out of 134 patients at autopsy, but was unassociated with relapse.
   Conclusions: CMV is a severe disease whose frequency is higher in severely immunodepressed patients. Continuous treatment leads to a lower relapse rate even if it does not change survival or eradicate the infection.

TI An assessment of disaster risk and its management in Thailand
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Historically, Thailand has been a disaster-free country, suffering only, minor losses from natural hazards through the years. Emerging as a newly industrialised nation, the kingdom now faces an increased risk of economic and public damage from man-made disasters associated with rapid development. A risk assessment was carried out on the level of disaster management. That assessment was preceded by an analysis of the traditional definitions of disaster risk, resulting in a redefinition to fit the needs of this study:. This holds that the risk of disaster is the product of hazards, vulnerability and the level of management exercised over both the hazard and the vulnerable elements,
   The results of the risk assessment, conducted through analysis of those three components, are discussed along with impediments which may hinder good disaster or accident management. Floods, in both natural and man-made manifestations, were identified as the highest risk factor, followed by major accidents and explosions, both man-made hazards. Major recommendations arising from the study included the consolidation of disaster management responsibilities currently held by several agencies into a central co-ordinating committee, the review and restructure of related law and regulations, the conduct of provincial and country-wide hazard assessments and the creation of a 'culture of safety' in Thailand.

AB The objective of the present study was to determine median age al natural menopause using the status quo method and the sociodemographic and reproductive variables that determine the age at natural menopause in Peruvian women from Lima and Cerro de Pasco. The study was performed in one urban area from Cerro de Pasco (4,340 m above sea level) and in one urban area from Lima (150 m above sea level). The total sample was 469 women aged 28-56 years, 216 from Cerro de Pasco and 253 from Lima. Median age at menopause was 47.1 years at sea level, and 46.14 years at high altitude (p = 0.0005). Results of the proportional hazard regression analysis showed that life at high altitude and lack of use of oral contraceptives were factors associated with early age at menopause, whereas later age at menarche and higher chronological age were associated with delayed age at menopause. In conclusion, altitude is a factor that independently accelerated age at natural menopause.

AB Soils that pose high risk of erosion require amendment with either natural or synthetic soil conditioners to reduce soil loss hazards. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of using coal-derived humic substances (as soil conditioners) to reduce runoff erosion on erosion-susceptible soils, Surface (0-20 cm) samples of severely degraded soils from Principina in Tuscany (Orthic Xerofluvent) and Bovolone in Venice (Udic Ustochrept) in Italy were used to assess the effects of five rates (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.50 and 1.00 g/kg) of humic acids (HA) on soil loss and other hydrological parameters. A rainfall simulator was used to apply approximately 40 mm/h intensity rain for 1 h on soil beds of dimensions 2 m X 0.5 m X 0.01 m, packed at a bulk density of 1.20 Mg/m(3) and inclined at a slope of 15%. The amount of soil eroded (E) and the time to initiate runoff (Rt) and drainage (Dt) were related to changes in the water-holding capacity and aggregate stability of the soils following the HA treatments, In the control treatments, the values of E, Rt and Dt were higher in the Principina than Bovolone soil. Increasing HA rates generally delayed Rt, accelerated Dt and reduced E substantially on both soils, On the Principina soil a reduction of about 36% in soil loss was obtained by adding only 0.05 g/kg of HA (equivalent to 100 kg/ha). On the sandier Bovolone soil, the same magnitude of reduction was achieved with 0.10 g/kg (200 kg/ha) of HA. Improvements in Rt and Dt from the HA amendments explained between 58 and 81% of the variation in E from both soils, Furthermore, improvements in the water retention capacity more than in the aggregate stability of these soils accounted for the reduced runoff erosion. These results show that amending erosion-susceptible soils with low rates of coal-derived humic substances is a potentially effective soil management practice for reducing erosion rates.

AB In addition to the traditional activities such as fishing and transportation, a steady growth in world trade, recreation, and exploration of underwater resources has caused a rapid growth in vessel traffic for several decades. This has increased the potential risk of marine casualties involving loss of life and damage to vessels, cargo, navigational aids, and structures (e.g. bridges). Various Asian, European, and North American countries have enacted a wide array of safety measures to reduce the casualties. For instance, the U.S. Coast Guard requires all incoming vessels to have a local pilot on board, have an officer on the bridge, and that the vessel operator should establish radio communications with the Coast Guard after getting on board. In addition, traffic separation lanes and convergence points have been established to improve traffic flow. Navigational aids assist the vessel operators by sensing oncoming traffic hazards such as bridges and shallow waters. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers keeps ship channels open by regularly dredging waterways that are used for commercial traffic. In many countries, offshore deep water ports similar to the loop in New Orleans, Louisiana, have been constructed to reduce traffic near shallow and congested ports. In spite of all these safety measures, accidents do happen. In this paper, we study the historic data related to the vessel accidents over a period of several years. In particular, we focus on the distribution of sizes of the oil spills that have occurred during these accidents. The sizes of the oil spills are ranked from largest to smallest. The regression analysis showed a strong linear relationship between the natural logarithm of size of casualty and the natural logarithm of its rank. The regression coefficients may indicate the 'degree of damage' in a particular year or for a specific geographic region under investigation. It could be argued that they could be used to assess an aggregated impact of the implemented safety measures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB There have been few reports on hypersensitivity to chironomid midges in bronchial asthmatic patients around the area of hypereutrophic natural lakes, which have been notorious as an environmental hazard due to the massive occurrence of adult chironomids during several periods of the year. Our study investigated IgE antibodies to chironomid midges in bronchial asthmatic patients around the Lake Suwa area in comparison with those of the Matsumoto area (control area). A total of 123 adult patients with bronchial asthma were investigated by measurement of IgE antibodies with extracts of three chironomid midges (Chironomus yoshimarsui, C. plumosus, and Tokunagayusurika akamusi), mite, and silkworm. In addition, in the allergy testing, 12 common inhalant antigens were used. Of 123 adult patients with bronchial asthma, 65 (52.8%) produced positive allergy tests. Thirty-three (50.8%) were positive to mite, 28 (43.1%) to silkworm, 11 (16.9%) to C. yoshimatsui, eight (12.3%) to C. plumosus, and three (4.6%) to T. akamusi. We compared our results with the previous reports. The number of positive tests to silkworm in the Lake Suwa area was higher than in other areas. However, C. plumosus and I: akamusi showed a lower number of positive reactions. We considered the lower positive number of C, plumosus and T. akamusi tests in the Lake Suwa area to be related to the advanced age of patients in this area. The chironomids are an important cause of asthma, together with mite and silkworm, in the Lake Suwa area, but affect old asthmatic patients less than asthmatic children.

AB Objective The objective of the study is to analyze the temporal trends in relative survival among patients with colon cancer in catchment areas of hospitals of different categories and regions in Sweden.
   Background In Sweden, cancer of the colon is the second most common type of cancer in women and the third most common in men, afflicting approximately 3000 individuals annually. During the past decades, survival has improved, but it is not clear what factors have contributed to this development. Changes in the natural history of the disease, altered alimentary habits, advances in diagnosis, and treatment have been suggested. The effects of centralized care still are debated.
   Method Longitudinal observational study of relative survival of all patients with colon cancer from 1973 to 1993 in Sweden (n = 41,700) by period of diagnosis and hospital category of primary catchment area was conducted. Multivariate analyses of relative hazards of any interaction between length of follow-up, period of diagnosis, hospital category of the primary catchment area, age at diagnosis, and region were performed.
   Results Relative survival in patients with colon cancer improved substantially from 1973 through 1990. The prognosis in patients from primary catchment areas of regional-university hospitals did not change during this period, and the prognostic improvement was noted only in county and local hospital areas, where survival approached that of regional hospitals. Although new management regimens may have been introduced unevenly, improved perioperative care best explains this convergence. Low-incidence regions showed the lowest survival, but this improved with time, although not significantly.
   Conclusions Although survival in patients with colon cancer improved and convergence between different catchment area categories was seen, a large initial gap as well as a remaining difference may warrant future monitoring to ensure equal prognosis, irrespective of domicile.

AB People frequently regard the landscape as part of a static system. The mountains and rivers that cross the landscape, and the bedrock that supports the surface, change little during the course of a lifetime. Society can alter the geologic history of an area and, in so doing, affect the occurrence and impact of environmental hazards. For example, changes in land use can induce changes in erosion, sedimentation, and ground-water supply. As the environmental system is changed by both natural processes and human activities, the system's capacity to respond to additional stresses also changes. Information such as geologic maps describes the physical world and is critical for identifying solutions to land use and environmental issues. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the economic value of applying geologic map information to siting a waste disposal facility. An improvement in geologic map information is shown to have a net positive value to society. Such maps enable planners to make superior land management decisions. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB We conducted a nonconcurrent prospective cohort study to examine associations between serum concentrations of vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate and the risk of progression to first acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis and CD4+ cell decline to < 2 x 10(8) cells/L. The study population was drawn from a cohort of homosexual and bisexual men in the Baltimore-Washington, DC, area. Eligible subjects were human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l)-seropositive at study entry and had serum available in the serum repository from their 1984 baseline study visit. Serum micronutrient levels were assessed in 310 subjects. The follow-up period (April 1984 through December 1993) was approximately 9 y. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, participants with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations (< 120 pmol/L) had significantly shorter AIDS-free time than those with adequate vitamin B-12 concentrations (median AIDS-free time = 4 vs. 8 y, respectively, P = 0.004). This effect persisted in Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for HIV-l-related symptoms, CD4+ cell count, age, serum albumin, use of antiretroviral therapy before AIDS, frequency of alcohol consumption and serum folate concentration [relative hazard (RH) = 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-3.10). To further explore the temporal relation between low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations and disease progression, additional analyses were performed excluding subjects with more advanced disease at baseline. In these analyses, the increase in risk of progression to AIDS for those with low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations remained significant (RH = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.13-4.34), providing further evidence that low vitamin B-12 concentrations preceded disease progression. In contrast, low serum concentrations of vitamin B-6 and folate were not associated with either progression to AIDS or decline in CD4+ lymphocyte count. Intervention studies are needed to determine whether correction of low serum vitamin B-12 concentrations in early HIV-1 infection will influence the natural history of disease progression.

ID MODEL
AB Various computational scenarios are analyzed for the evaluation of volcanic CO2 and SO2 concentrations in the air over the island of Vulcano (Aeolian Archipelago, north of Sicily). Simulations were done using a 3D mesoscale meteorological model for complex terrain. Local wind depends on differences in land heating and cooling and on island topography. Flow model outputs were used by a Lagrangian particle model to simulate dispersion of gases emitted from crater fumaroles. Both models were able to reproduce observations. Simulation of the fumarolic gas dispersion at Vulcano were performed for selected summertime conditions, when more than 10,000 tourists reside in the area of Vulcano Porto. In the inhabited area NW of the cone, the highest concentrations of gases occur near sunrise, due to nocturnal stratification and downslope breezes from the volcano. Present gas emission rates from crater fumaroles do not pose any hazard for humans, An SO2 output rate two orders of magnitude higher with respect to a considered case of 30 tons per day may pose an hazard.

ID NATURAL-HISTORY
AB A systematic review of the neurologic literature identified 433 cases of pathologically proven multiple system atrophy over a 100-year period. Earlier case reports included patients younger in age with more frequent cerebellar involvement. Mean age of onset was 54.2 years (range 31 to 78) and survival was 6.2 years (range 0.5 tu 24). Survival analysis showed a secular trend from a median duration of 4.9 years for publications between 1887 and 1970 to 6.8 years between 1991 and 1994. Older age of onset was associated with shorter survival; the hazard ratio for patients with onset after 60 years mas 1.8 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) compared with patients between 31 and 49 years. Cerebellar features were associated with marginally increased survival (6.1 years versus 5.4 years; p = 0.04). There were no differences in survival according to gender, parkinsonian, or pyramidal features or whether the patient was classified as striatonigral degeneration or olivopuntocerebellar atrophy type. These results demonstrate the poor prognosis for patients with multiple system atrophy but may be biased toward the worst cases. Future research needs to recruit more representative samples.

ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; APENNINES
AB The importance of preserving Italian hilltop towns through a general geotechnical strategy is discussed and is followed by a specific review of the hydrogeological conditions responsible for regional mass movements at ancient hilltop towns in Basilicata. A historical survey of reactivations in colluvial deposits al selected sites in the region suggested that increased activity was taking place in response to extreme rainfall events, possibly related to long-term climatic changes. The importance of natural and anthropogenic processes along critical hydrogeological boundary conditions in relation to this activity is then reviewed and one example of urban landsliding from Grassano in the Basento valley is described. Local structure, such as faulting, was shown to be especially important in the location of both groundwater discharge (springs) and the landsliding. The landslide activity in the town was also shown to be related to a period of population expansion and possible domestic water leakages following the provision of a pumped supply. It is suggested that these anthropogenic processes reduce the usefulness of empirical links between landslide frequency, rainfall extremes or other explanations involving climatic change. Finally. a strategy for landslide management based on the use of hydrogeological conceptual models and GIS technology is proposed.

TI Discordant xenogeneic neonatal thymic transplantation can induce
   donor-specific tolerance
SO TRANSPLANTATION
LA English

ID CLONAL DELETION; MOLECULE; MICE
AB The limited supply of human organs for transplantation necessitates the development of methods leading to acceptance of xenografts, To avoid the hazards of the high-dose chronic immunosuppressive pharmacotherapy which would otherwise be required for successful xenografting, it would be desirable to induce permanent tolerance to xenogeneic donors. We have recently demonstrated that xenogeneic donor-specific tolerance can be induced by transplanting fetal pig thymic and hematopoietic tissue into thymectomized, T cell-depleted, and natural killer-cell-depleted mice, or into natural killer cell-depleted nude mice. We have now extended these studies by replacing fetal tissue with neonatal pig thymic and hematopoietic tissue, and by examining the in vivo responses of reconstituted mice to pig skin grafts, Neonatal tissue was studied because it might be more practicable than fetal tissue for the purpose of transplantation to primates. BALB/c nu/nu mice transplanted with neonatal (<24-hr-old) pig thymus and spleen fragments developed circulating mouse CD4(+) cells. The pig thymus grafts were necessary for mouse T-cell development, as CD4 recovery did not occur in recipients of neonatal pig splenic tissue alone, The CD4(+) cells that developed included V beta 8.1/2(+) T cells in similar proportions as in BALB/c mice, and V beta 11(+) and V beta 5(+) CD4 T cells were deleted almost as completely as in normal BALB/c mice, This deletion was detected among CD4 single-positive graft thymocytes. In 9 of 12 evaluable animals, mixed lymphocyte responses demonstrated tolerance to donor type pig SLA antigens, with responsiveness to alloantigens and/or third-party pig xenoantigens. Furthermore, grafting of neonatal pig thymus conferred the ability to reject allogeneic mouse skin in 7 of 10 animals, In addition, 7 of 10 animals accepted paternal (donor SLA-matched) skin (median survival time [MST] > 100 days), whereas 4 of 4 animals rejected third-party SLA-mismatched pig skin (MST=40.5 days). We conclude that neonatal pig thymi transplanted to BALB/c nu/nu mice can support the development of mouse CD4(+) cells that are functional and specifically tolerant to donor-type pig antigens.

AB There are two possibilities for virus contamination of foodstuff and bioproducts of animal origin: i) the presence of endogenous virus as a result of an acute or subclinical infection of animal raw material used for food processing or ii) contamination of food in the course of processing or thereafter. The latter must be considered as the highest risk for human consumers since the viral contamination mostly is caused by virus shedding people and the transmitted viruses are obligate human pathogens. Food from animals consumed as raw material (e.g. oysters) is listed in a high risk category concerning viral contamination (e.g. hepatovirus). Virus contamination of bioproducts such as vaccines, blood products or biological material used in surgery and for transplantations also is more hazardous because the application of contaminating virus usually occurs by circumvention of the natural barrier systems of the body. Moreover, in many cases immunosuppressed people are treated with bioproducts. Due to an enclosing shield of high protein and lipid content in food and bioproducts viruses are well protected against physical and chemical influences, however most preparation procedures for food are destructive for viruses. The detection of pseudorabies virus and pestivirus in biological fluids was tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and cell culture propagation. PCR is a powerful method to detect viral nucleic acid whereas the detection of infectious virus in cell cultures is more limited, e. g. due to protein and lipid destroying conditions. Virus contamination of bioproducts should be considered as a hazard no matter which method has been used for its detection. Examples are given about the contamination of cell lines and vaccines.

AB After eighteen months of active remediation at a JP-4 jet-fuel spill, a residual of unremediated hydrocarbon remained. Further site characterization was conducted to evaluate the contribution of natural attenuation to control exposure to hazards associated with the residual contamination in the subsurface. Activities included the detailed characterization of ground-water flow through the spill; the distribution of fuel contaminants in groundwater; and the analysis of soluble electron accepters moving into the spill from upgradient. These activities allowed a rigorous evaluation of the transport of contaminants from the spill to the receptor of groundwater, the Pasquotank River. The transport of dissolved contaminants of concern, that is benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene isomers (BTEX) and methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), into the river from the source area was controlled by equilibrium dissolution from the fuel spill to the adjacent groundwater, diffusion in groundwater from the spill to permeable layers in the aquifer, and advective transport in the permeable layers. The estimated yearly loading of BTEX compounds and MTBE into the receptor was trivial even without considering biological degradation. The biodegradation of hydrocarbon dissolved in groundwater through aerobic respiration, denitrification, sulfate reduction, and iron reduction was estimated from changes in ground-water chemistry along the flow path. The concentrations of target components in permanent monitoring wells continue to decline over time. Long term monitoring will ensure that the plume is under control, and no further active remediation is required.

AB The objective of the NRP 31 is the detailed study of the mechanisms and consequences of future climate changes in the Swiss environment, and the resulting interactions between climate, the water cycle, natural hazards, ecosystems and society.
   This programme should help improve our understanding of the response of the environment to abrupt short-term climatic events and to long-term climate changes, and provide answers to economic and political decision making. The emphasis of research will be on processes acting on the regional scale, especially in the Swiss Alps. Consequences of climate changes on the cryosphere and the hydrosphere are exposed, according to the announced evolution of the parameters temperature and precipitation.
   NRP 31 is an attempt to bring together specific projects in especially sensitive geographical test-zones, as representative as possible of Swiss conditions.

DE natural disasters; climate change; insurance
AB In the last few decades, the international insurance industry has bean confronted with a drastic increase in the scope and frequency of great natural disasters. The trend is primarily attributable to the continuing steady growth of the world population and the increasing concentration of people and economic values in urban areas. An additional factor is the global migration of populations and industries into areas such as coastal regions, which are particularly exposed to natural hazards. The natural hazards themselves, on the other hand, have not yet shown a significant trend, in spite of a number of indications.
   The present problems of the insurance industry with regard to pricing, capacity and loss reserves will be dramatically aggravated if the greenhouse predictions come true. The shifting of climatic zones and the increasing intensity of convective processes in the atmosphere will probably force up the frequency and severity of windstorms including tornados, hailstorms, floods and storm surges in many parts of the world with serious consequences for all types of property Insurance.
   Rates will have to be raised and in certain coastal areas or flood plains insurance cover will only be available after considerable restrictions have been imposed, as for example significant deductibles and low liability or loss limits. In areas of high insurance density the loss potential of individual catastrophes can reach a level at which the national and international insurance industries will run into serious capacity problems. Recent disasters showed the disproportionately high participation of reinsurers in extreme disaster losses and the need for more risk transparency if the insurance industry is to fulfil its obligations in an increasingly hostile environment.

AB Glacier shrinkage in the Alps has been clearly manifest since the middle of the 19th century and could continue beyond the limits of holocene variability in the near future. Changes in Alpine permafrost are less well documented but are likely to take place at various time and depth scales. This development leads to a variety of slope stability problems in bedrock and non-consolidated sediments (moraines and scree slopes). A brief overview, with references to recent literature, is given with regard to characteristic situations and interactions as illustrated by recent events observed in the Alps. The achievement of progress in recognizing and mitigating risks from such slope stability problems in high mountain areas requires improved process understanding from field observations and computer modelling, systematic investigation of natural archives reflecting former slope instability processes and adequate monitoring of potentially critical situations.

The magnitude is not necessarily dependent on the recurrence interval. The characteristics of the catchment basin (disposition) an mainly controlling the magnitude. In order to evaluate the effects of climatic change on the debris flow activity, knowledge about the magnitude and the frequency are necessary.

AB Snow avalanches are an important natural hazard in alpine areas. Especially settlements and traffic routes are threatened. A better understanding of the relations between avalanche occurrence and climate is necessary to deduce possible effects of climate changes on the avalanche hazard. This study investigates the relations of climatic conditions on avalanche release from 1947-1993 and extreme snowfall events from 1896-1993. The statistical evaluation of the meteorological data shows a long-term trend in temperature, but not in snow depth and extreme snowfall events. From the meteorological long-term time series at Davos (eastern Switzerland) we tried to model the corresponding avalanche activity from 1896-1946. The modelling of the avalanche activity was not successful because the extremely sparse distribution of extreme events prevented the establishment of a reliable statistical model. Looking at potential avalanche situations in terms of extreme weather situations it can be assumed that the climatic causes for severe avalanche periods have remained stable during the past 100 years and show no sign of change in the near future. However, the construction of defence structures in avalanche starting zones, improved zoning of hazardous areas and artificial avalanche release have reduced the probability of catastrophic events.

AB Intimate associations among individuals of three common species of Caribbean coral reef sponges can be mutually beneficial. Both growth rate and survival are enhanced when heterospecific sponges adhere to each other, as demonstrated by experiments in which sponges of the same size and genotype were grown (1) in intimate association with conspecific vs. heterospecific sponges, (2) alone vs. in intimate association with conspecific sponges, and (3) alone on the primary substratum vs. attached to an intact branch of a conspecific or heterospecific sponge. Natural development and long-term dynamics of these associations were observed in unmanipulated individuals and also modelled by an experiment in which branches were exchanged between neighboring sponges. The three species studied (lotrochota birotulata, Amphimedon rubens, and Aplysina fulva) share an erect branching growth form but differ in tissue and skeletal characteristics sufficiently that they are in different orders of the Class Demospongiae. Reflecting these differences, the species are demonstrated to differ from each other in their susceptibility to a variety of environmental hazards, including predation by angelfishes and trunkfishes, predation by starfish, smothering by sediment, breakage by storm waves, pulverization by storm waves, toppling by storm waves, fragment mortality, and pathogens. Although the mechanisms by which growth rate is enhanced by adhering to a heterospecific sponge are unknown, these sponges appear to be able to decrease their loss rate by adhering tightly to sponges of species that differ from them in chemistry, tissue density, and skeletal construction, thereby increasing survival of hazards to which they would succumb when growing alone.

AB The noxious potential of metallurgical tailings from the Ag/Pb/Zn/Cu mining district of Sta. Maria de la Pat (Mexico) is ascertained via the chemical characterization of slag material. Batch experiments using various extraction solutions (e.g. natural rainwater, water rich in humic substances, ammonium nitrate solution) revealed information on the dissolution behaviour of the elements Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Ba and Pb from slag with respect of grain size (slag material screened under 2 mm and analytically fine fraction) and elution time (2, 7.5, 24 and 240 h). An initial ecotoxicological assessment of the results is made and the environmental danger caused by large volumes of slag tailings is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Louisiana Lung Cancer Dataset, consisting of 337 extended pedigrees, is analyzed to determine whether a major Mendelian gene interacts with cumulative tobacco smoking (pack-years). The proportional hazards model is utilized, as it is a natural framework for estimating relative risks while adjusting for variability in age of disease onset. Segregation analyses show evidence that a Mendelian gene is segregating in these families, with the most parsimonious model, including sex, pack-years, pack-years squared, and a dominant major gene. The estimated frequency of the high-risk allele is 2% and carriers are estimated to have relative risk of 17.3 for developing lung cancer, compared to noncarriers. The addition of a gene x pack-years interaction does not significantly improve the fit of the model, indicating that on a multiplicative scale, these two factors independently influence lung cancer risk. Smoking history is missing for 23% of the study subjects and degree of ''missingness'' depends on disease status, age, and birth-year. To account for the nonrandomness of the missing data, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for covariate imputation is proposed and implemented. Results from this analysis also support a nonsignificant gene-smoking interaction and an allele frequency of 2%, but a lower genetic relative risk (9.0) compared to the ''complete case'' analysis.

AB Selenium is both essential and toxic for living organisms (including human beings) in a relatively narrow range and at trace level. Its presence in sewage sludge can be positive in the case of land application when concentrations are relatively low, but can also lead to a Long-term hazard to plants, water resources, animals, and human beings.
   We have then developed a method for the wet digestion of sewage sludge and the determination of their total selenium concentration by DPCSV and ETAAS. Quality assurance was made by the analysis of two BCR certified sewage sludge reference materials (CRM 145R and CRM 007) and tested on a natural sample from a representative French sewage treatment plant.
   However, knowledge of speciation is necessary when speaking of the toxicological risk represented by an element. Different techniques of soft extraction, applied to CRM 007 and respecting species distribution, are discussed.

AB Reduced CD4 T cell level and increased serum neopterin and beta(2)-microglobulin levels, which reflect immunological activation and dysregulation, are three important markers of HIV disease. The aim in this study is to delineate more clearly the relation of activation to future CD4 values and disease progression. By analyzing a cohort of 198 seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study with 9 years' follow-up, the dynamic changes and levels of these three markers and their interrelationships are explored. We observed that the levels of markers in the first year after seroconversion have a much stronger impact on the progression of the disease than the preseroconversion marker levels. The actual change during the year after seroconversion is not as important as the final level reached during that year. The early levels of markers after seroconversion appear to be good indicators of the subsequent course of disease as defined by CD4 level and slightly better than the quantitative changes following seroconversion or the changes in the period 1 to 2.5 years after seroconversion. To investigate the variation between subjects, the 198 seroconverters were stratified into three approximately equal-sized groups in 12 ways based on their pre- and postseroconversion levels and changes in the three markers. The group with the highest CD4 level within a year after seroconversion maintains the highest CD4 level 8 years after seroconversion. The group with the lowest level of neopterin or beta(2)-microglobulin in this period has much higher future CD4 counts than the other two groups. The level of markers during the first year after seroconversion has a high predictive power for AIDS onset. Substantial differences in the hazards of AIDS are found between the groups with the highest and lowest CD4 count, neopterin, and beta(2)-microglobulin following seroconversion. The three markers are generally correlated throughout the postseroconversion period but can provide distinct information. High current levels of neopterin or beta(2)-microglobulin tend to be associated with low future CD4 count, while current levels of CD4 count have less association with future neopterin and beta(2)-microglobulin levels.

AB The evaluation of hazards from complex, large scale, technologically advanced systems often requires the construction of computer implemented mathematical models. These models are used to evaluate the safety of the systems and to evaluate the consequences of modifications to the systems. These evaluations, however, are normally surrounded by significant uncertainties related to the uncertainty inherent in natural phenomena such as the weather and those related to uncertainties in the parameters and models used in the evaluation.
   Another use of these models is to evaluate strategies for improving information used in the modeling process itself, While sensitivity analysis is useful in defining variables in the model that are important, uncertainty analysis provides a tool for assessing the importance of uncertainty about these variables. A third complementary technique, is decision analysis. It provides a methodology for explicitly evaluating and ranking potential improvements to the model. Its use in the development of information gathering strategies for a nuclear waste repository are discussed in this paper.

AB This study was undertaken to meet a need in New Zealand about five years ago. Earlier an increased use of ceramic tiling and polished natural stones within buildings and on adjacent pavements highlighted what was an existing problem of frequent use of low slip resistance materials for pedestrian areas. A national standard, NZS 5841 ''Code of Practice for the Reduction of Slip Hazard-Part 1, Guidelines.....'', had been prepared. However, because it was qualitative rather than quantitative in approach, its application was limited. Building regulators wished to have a standard with minimal criteria and appropriate test methods so they could enforce minimum requirements, and there was some support for this approach from architects and materials suppliers. There was, however, uncertainty as to the appropriate test method and, consequently, of the minimum criteria.

AB Microbial control agents offer a method of pest control using organisms that are a natural component of the environment and are usually much more selective than chemical pesticides. Furthermore, they can usually be integrated with other methods of control, and may provide prolonged control by establishment within the host population. However, microbial control agents also possess properties that can pose human and environmental risks depending on the nature of the pathogen and its pattern of use. We present an overview of issues concerning the safety and registration of microbial control agents with emphasis on pathogens of locusts and grasshoppers. The potential safety issues and other consequences of concern from the deployment of microorganisms for pest control are: (1) pathogenicity to non-target organisms, (2) toxigenicity to non-target organisms, (3) competitive displacement of microorganisms, and (4) allergenicity. Inundative control methods pose unique risks because the pathogens must be produced in large quantities, stored, transported, and applied, usually in concentrations much higher than would normally ever occur naturally. The overriding concern in introducing an exotic agent is the risk to non-target beneficial organisms, because once the agent becomes established. it will in most situations be impossible to eradicate. However, if indigenous organisms are used, there is relatively little risk of irreversible, long-term detrimental effects. A synopsis of safety testing results of some of the more promising microbial control agents for grasshoppers and locusts and an evaluation of their potential hazards are presented. Safety to vertebrates is evaluated by a tiered series of laboratory test requirements. Assessments on hazards to non-target invertebrates are based principally on results of laboratory bioassays. Safety tests should be chosen with regard to the biological characteristics of the agent and should not impose standards that are more stringent than those imposed on other forms of pest control. Regulatory oversight should assure the integrity of the environment and safety of the public, while at the same time not unduly hampering the development, registration, and use of more sustainable pest control methods.

AB The SSM/I microwave Brightness Temperatures (TB's) in the frequency domains of 85 and 19 GHz gathered from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-F8 satellite form the basis of this research. These data are related to 27 map times of 13 typhoons of the 1987 season, one typhoon of the 1988 season and one cyclone in the Indian Ocean in 1987. The TB's disclosed certain characteristics of typhoons unavailable through conventional infrared (IR) imagery means.
   Brightness Temperatures were chosen to delineate the typhoon characteristics rather than the derived geophysical parameters such as rainfall or surface winds because the TB's have better resolution. The footprint size of the 85 GHz TB is 15 x 13 km while a derived (through algorithms based on regression) quantity such as rainfall has a much higher footprint size. The relatively large footprint size of rainfall results, because of using the 19 GHz channel which has a larger footprint size of 69 x 43 km.
   The mean 85 GHz (vertically polarized, V) TB's of a moving typhoon, particularly those on the left side within 55 km of the center, appear to exhibit a practically usable correlation with the 24 hour intensity. This finding is consistent with some observational studies, which show higher rain rates to occur within the asymmetric eyewalls of developing tropical cyclones. Further stratification of the sample in terms of direction of movement improved the correlation
   The TB anomalies were defined in terms of the TB differences between two sections of a typhoon (e.g., between right and left sides or between inner and outer areas). The development of this sort of anomalies represents a relative growth of deep convection close to the center. If there is a good growth, the cyclone is likely to intensify within a short period of time. The anomalies also showed good correlation with the 24-h intensity. The intensity change (24-h intensity - Current Intensity) was also correlated with the 85 GHz V mean TB values, as well as, with 85 GHz V TB anomalies as defined above. Significant correlations ensued. Since these preliminary results are promising, further experimentation with a larger sample is suggested. Nevertheless, the scientist interested in natural hazards would find the current results valuable in the problem of typhoon intensification.

AB National geological survey organizations are amongst the oldest government scientific agencies in many countries. Their evolution thus usually reflects the history of scientific and economic patterns and policies in their home jurisdictions. In most cases this evolution progressed from the classic 'frontier' exploration phase, through the development of information bases for use mainly in mineral, Fuel and water resource development. In many modern organizations, the thrust is increasingly toward environment-related activities, including natural hazards, geochemical baselines and sustainable development.

AB Computational models for the July, 1994 collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter have provided a framework for interpreting the observational data. Imaging, photometry, and spectroscopy data from ground-based, Hubble Space Telescope, and Galileo spacecraft instruments are consistent with phenomena that were dominated by the generation of incandescent fireballs that were ballistically ejected to high altitudes, where they formed plumes that subsequently collapsed over large areas of Jupiter's atmosphere. Applications of similar computational models to collisions into Earth's atmosphere show that a very similar sequence of events should take place for NEO impacts with energies as low as 3 megatons, recurring on 100 year timescales or less. This result suggests that the 1908 Tunguska event was a plume-forming atmospheric explosion, and that some of the phenomena associated with it might be related to the ejection and collapse of a high plume. Hazards associated with plume growth and collapse should be included in the evaluation of the impact threat to Earth, and opportunities should be sought for observational validation of atmospheric impact models by exploiting data already being collected from the natural flux of multikiloton to megaton sized objects that constantly enter Earth's atmosphere on annual to decadal timescales.

AB Mining the potentially vast storehouse of natural resources contained within near-Earth objects (NEOs) could assist mitigation of the danger that a threatening object presents to life on Earth. Properly planned, NEO mining could provide a substantial basis for the exploration and development of space, in addition to providing important tools and opportunities for mitigating impact hazards.
   The key to successful NEO mining is the appropriate modification of tried-and-true terrestrial mining techniques for the very unfamiliar and dangerous environment of space. Mining engineering is unlike traditional engineering disciplines in that, as a whole, it is less easily quantified; the practitioner must retain flexibility and resilience in the face of wide and unknown variations in material properties. This unique element of mining engineering will be an asset in space operations. Understanding of the basics of mining and processing will improve the planning and designing of NEO mitigation missions.
   Space possesses many properties that are unique in human experience. Some of these can provide efficient new means of accomplishing old tasks. Others will prove to be obstacles that must be overcome. Mining and processing techniques that are inefficient curiosities on Earth may form the basis of powerful new methodologies in space. On the other hand, some vital processes will demand innovative engineering for success. This paper discusses the effects of the space environment on the application to NEO resources of mining methodologies developed over more than a thousand years on Earth. It will focus on the four mechanical classifications of NEOs described in Gertsch et al. (this volume).

TI Second round of evaluations of proposed earthquake precursors
SO PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This review summarizes the result of the second round of nominations for the IASPEI Preliminary List of Significant Precursors. Currently this List contains five cases of precursors: (1) foreshocks, (2) preshocks, (3) seismic quiescence before major aftershocks, (4) radon decrease in ground water, and (5) ground water level increase. A list of four cases that could not be accepted nor rejected by the panels reviewing them contains three on crustal deformations and one on seismic quiescence. In the second round 10 nominations were evaluated, nine new ones and one which had been considered previously. Two were accepted for the List, two were placed in the category of undecided cases. To date, a total of 40 nominations have been evaluated by IASPEI. For 37 of these the nominations, the mail reviews, the panel opinions, and, where supplied, the author's reply were published. This evaluation process remains active throughout the International Decade For Natural Hazards Reduction. Additional nominations are invited.
   The IASPEI Sub-commission on Earthquake Prediction does not guarantee that precursors accepted for the List can be used for earthquake prediction, nor does rejection of a nomination mean that the particular method could never become useful for prediction. However, the List, as well as the interchanges between authors and reviewers, allow us to gauge the state-of-the-art in earthquake prediction research. It is clear that we do not have an earthquake prediction capability, because the manner in which to use the few precursors on the List for predictions is-not known. It also appears that many of the results thought to be conclusive by the authors, may not command the respect of the seismological research community at large. A more quantitative approach to data analysis, the use of rigorous statistical techniques, and high quality, long-term data sets are needed to make progress in earthquake prediction research.

AB Natural radioactivity has been measured in marble stone samples collected from Dabaa'h, Ajloun and Azrak areas using a gamma spectroscopy technique. The measured Ra-226 activities in the stones collected from Dabaa'h quarries varied from 264.9 Bq kg(-1) to 369.5 Bq kg(-1). In samples from Ajloun and Azrak the maximum values of Ra-226 were 28.3 Bq kg(-1) and 23.41 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The measured values of Th-232 were less than 17.89 Bq kg(-1). The average values of the radium equivalent activities as well as external and internal hazard indices were also calculated. It was observed that for marble stones from Dabaa'h area, estimated average value of the external hazard index is 0.873 and that of internal hazard index is 1.71.

AB It is pointed out that, contrary to the situation with natural Rn, the growing concentration of man-made Pu in environment - natural water, soil, plants and food - can provide the serious danger for all kind of animals and especially for mankind. Really, as it was established recently, element Pu is accumulated in human body during all the life and the dangerous concentration estimated to be 10(-12) - 10(-13) gram Pu per gram of human tissues. Unfortunately up to now there are no simple nonexpensive methods of Pu determination at the level of sensitivity 10(-14) - 10(15) g/g which can provide the determination of Pu even in 0.2 g of human tissue. We warn that now the average concentration of Pu in human body is not less than 10(-14) g/g and much higher for some "hot" regions in Europe and Asia. We propose to discuss the problem of organizing world net exploration of Pu in environment - similarly to Rn exploration program - and personnel Pu monitoring for inhibitions of Pu damaged regions. Our approach to the problem is based on chemical separation of Pu, on determination of Plutonium by high fission cross section with thermal neutrons Pu-239(n, f) reaction and by control of possible admixture of U-235 isotope by U-238(gamma, f) reaction in Pu preparations. The problem of increasing of sensitivity of Pu analysis up to 10(-14) - 10(-15) g/g is discussed in detail.

AB The activities of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 radionuclides have been measured in marble chips, sand, hard rock and cement samples using gamma ray spectroscopy. Radium equivalent activities and external hazard indices have been calculated. These results indicate that all of the materials investigated in this work, except marble chips from Amman, are acceptable for use as construction materials according to the criterion proposed by OECD countries. For some samples of marble chips from Amman, the external hazard index is found to be greater than unity. This should not pose any health hazard if it constitutes a smaller fraction of the construction materials.

At entry, 229 had seromarkers to HBV; during the study, 107 had a CD4(+) cell. count <200 x 10(6) cells/L and 66 developed AIDS. HBsAg chronic carriers, HBV infection-free subjects and those with baseline evidence of prior HBV infection did not differ in rates of progression to end points. Sexual transmission of HIV was significant predictor of CD4(+) cell decline to <200 x 10(6) cells/l [Hazard ratio (HZ): 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.29, p=0.0232] and progression to AIDS (HZ:1.91, CI: 1.17-3.11, p=0.0091). 15 HIV-positive and HBV infection-free patients had HBV seroconversion. They did not differ from those who remained HBV infection-free in rates of progression to end points, but 40% of them became HBsAg chronic carriers. These results suggest that HBV has no influence on progression of HIV disease, but that patients who have HIV before their HBV infection are more likely to become HBsAg chronic carriers than those who are infected with HBV before HIV.

AB In this survey we consider the model of right random censorship in which the quantity of primary interest is the lifetime distribution function F. Kaplan and Meier (1958) derived a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator F-n for F, which is a natural generalization of the empirical distribution function in the complete data case. It was Efron (1981) who first proposed procedures for the construction of bootstrap observations, which then produce a bootstrapped version F-n* of F-n. We discuss the properties of F-n and F-n(*) which lead to the important consistency result: almost surely, as n --> infinity, the process n(1/2)(F-n* - F-n) converges weakly to the same Gaussian limit as the original Kaplan-Meier process n(1/2)(F-n - F). We also deal with the analogous properties for the corresponding quantile processes. Moreover, we consider the question of accuracy of the bootstrap approximation. Finally, we look into the situation of regression models which study the effect of covariates on the distributions of the lifetimes. We consider bootstrap procedures for the regression parameter in Cox's proportional hazards model and for Beran's distribution function estimator in a fixed design nonparametric regression model.

AB Four methods of baiting were evaluated on a radio-collared population of feral cats on Heirisson Prong, Shark Bay, Western Australia. Dried-meat baits, baiting rabbits to kill cats through secondary poisoning, a fishmeal-based bait and a bait coated in the flavour enhancer Digest were tested. All proved to be ineffective for controlling feral cats. Future research should explore baits more 'natural' in appearance and the effect of visual lures, and possibly bait over a larger area to increase the number of cats exposed to baits.

TI Health dilemmas at the borders - A global challenge
SO WORLD HEALTH FORUM
LA English
DT Article
ID SAN-DIEGO; REFUGEES; POPULATION; WOMEN
AB The health and safety of border crossers and people who live in border areas are widely neglected. The remoteness of many communities living near international borders makes it difficult to provide them with services, and if a country's border controls are inadequate there is an increased risk from communicable diseases for ifs entire population. Substance abuse and associated behavioural problems can be more common in border regions for the same reason. Armed conflicts, economic pressures and natural disasters can precipitate the movement of refugees across borders and the disruption of local infrastructures. Environmental hazards tend to be heightened in border regions because of the dumping of waste, the pollution of the atmosphere by slow-moving vehicles, and the contamination of water by sewage. Furthermore, dangers may arise because of unsafe implementation of trade agreements and the movement of unregulated materials. There is an urgent need for health education and the promotion of family and individual health care in many border regions. A global initiative on health and safely at international borders is clearly needed. It should include needs assessment, new policies and action programmes.

AB Background: Angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. Purpose: We investigated whether angiogenesis as measured by microvessel count (MVC) predicts clinical outcome in a series of patients with axillary lymph node-negative breast cancer who received no adjuvant therapy and who were followed for a long period of time. Our long-term goal is to identify those patients who may or may not need adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Pathologic archival material and clinical information were analyzed for 167 patients treated with mastectomy from 1941 through 1987; none received adjuvant treatment. The median follow-up time among living patients was 15.4 years (range, 2.6-35.8 years). Ninety-six (58%) patients had a tumor size of 2 cm or less, 52 (31%) had tumors of 2.1-3 cm, and 19 (11%) had tumors of larger than 3 cm. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained for expression of CD34 antigen on microvessel-associated endothelial cells by use of a monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody. Vascularity was defined as the number of microvessels (average of the three highest counts) per high-power microscopic field (400x magnification) in the area of highest vascular density. A high vascular count mas defined as 15 or more microvessels per field. Actuarial survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and comparisons mere made with the logrank test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis. All P values were based on two-sided testing Results: The 20-year disease-free survival (DFS) for the 167 node-negative patients treated with mastectomy and no adjuvant therapy was 74.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 64.7%-82.0%). The 20-year DFS was 93.1% (95% CI = 79.9%-97.7%) if the MVC was low versus 68.9% (95% CI = 56.8%-78.0%) if the MVC was high (P =.018). This difference was maintained irrespective of tumor size: for tumor size of 2 cm or less (93.3% [95% CI = 75.3%-98.3%] versus 67.8% [95% CI = 50.1%-80.3%]) and for tumor size of larger than 2 cm (92.3% [95% CI = 56.6%-98.9%] versus 70.9% [95% CI = 54.6%-81.6%]). However, the likelihood of a high MVC was greater with large tumors (P =.05). The proportions of tumors with low and high MVC were 33% and 67%, respectively, if the tumor size mas 2 cm or less, and 20% and 80%, respectively, if tumor size was larger than 2 cm. There was no significant difference in the 20-year DFS as a function of tumor grade (P =.2). After combining patients with tumors of nuclear grades 2 and 3 compared with those of nuclear grade 1, the 20-year DFS was 93.9% (95% CI = 77.2%-98.4%) for low MVC versus 66.9% (95% CI = 52.2%-78.0%) for high MVC (P =.02). In a multivariate analysis that included the variables tumor size, age, nuclear grade, estrogen receptor status, and MVC, only MVC appeared to be an independent prognostic indicator (P =.04). Conclusions: Angiogenesis as measured by MVC is a reliable independent prognostic marker of long-term survival in patients with node-negative breast cancer. The prognostic usefulness of this marker is maintained after more than 15 years of follow-up. A low MVC identifies a subgroup of patients with DFS of 92% or more, independent of tumor size or grade.

AB By making a clear distinction between catch and removal, catch-effort methods can be applied in broader circumstances than generally believed. For instance, animals can be added to a population rather than removed, data on animal sightings can be treated as 'catch,' and more than one bind of data (e.g., data on both sightings and kill) can be used jointly to produce population estimates. Models and estimation procedures are presented which illustrate these possibilities. Also, least squares estimation (generally nonlinear) can be used in conjunction with any likelihood model, and we illustrate this procedure in a simulation study involving both natural and catch hazard functions. Properly formulated, least squares estimates appear to be as accurate and precise as corresponding maximum likelihood estimates.

AB Background Although heart rate variability (HRV) is altered in a variety of pathological conditions, the association of reduced HRV with risk for new cardiac events has not been studied in a Large community-based population.
   Methods and Results The first 2 hours of ambulatory ECG recordings obtained on subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who were free of clinically apparent coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure were reprocessed to assess HRV. Five frequency-domain measures and three time-domain measures were obtained. The associations between HRV measures and the incidence of new cardiac events (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or congestive heart failure) were assessed with proportional hazards regression analyses. There were 2501 eligible subjects with a mean age of 53 years. During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, cardiac events occurred in 58 subjects. After adjustment for age, sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, and other relevant risk factors, all HRV measures except the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power were significantly associated with risk for a cardiac event (P=.0016 to .0496). A one-standard deviation decrement in the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals (natural log transformed) was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.47 for new cardiac events (95% confidence interval of 1.16 to 1.86).
   Conclusions The estimation of HRV by ambulatory monitoring offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.

AB Acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) has been proposed as the primary normalization phase for the development of sediment quality criteria for certain cationic metals. This study was designed to assist in this development by providing necessary field data on the relationships among season, AVS concentrations, and zinc bioavailability and toxicity in freshwater sediments. Zinc was spiked into uncontaminated sediments collected from a local pond, creating five simultaneously extracted metal (SEM) concentrations ranging from 0.8 to 12.0 mu mol/g dry weight. The spiked sediments were transferred to 4-L plastic trays, returned to the bottom of the pond, and sampled on five dates during 1993-1994. Results revealed a pronounced increase in AVS concentration with increasing zinc concentration. Acid-volatile sulfide concentrations in zinc-spiked sediments displayed only minor seasonal variation but were lowest in surficial (0-2 cm) sediments. Acid-volatile sulfide concentrations always exceeded SEM concentrations at less than or equal to 6.0 pmol SEM/g; only at 12.0 mu mol SEM/g did SEM/AVS ratios exceed 1.0. Zinc was rarely detected in pore water at any treatment and never at concentrations which should have posed a hazard to benthic macroinvertebrates. No substantial effect on colonization of zinc-spiked sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates was observed. Only oligochaetes (Naididae) were significantly reduced in abundance at the high zinc treatment, although reductions were occasionally evident for other taxa. Lack of noteworthy pore-water zinc concentrations and lack of associated, ecologically meaningful effects were attributed to the increase in AVS levels observed with increasing SEM zinc sediment concentration. The increases in AVS theoretically resulted from a replacement of natural iron and manganese sulfides with the more stable zinc sulfide complex.

AB The Lesser Himalaya, as the most densely populated part of the tectonically active and ecologically sensitive Himalayan mountain ranges, deserves specific attention to the conservation of the environment and the sustainable development of natural resources. Rapid growth of the human population during recent years, and the absence of any viable means of livelihood other than uneconomic crop farming have led to the uncontrolled exploitation of land areas and the consequent degradation and depletion of critical biophysical resources in the region. The need for sustainable development in Himalaya, therefore, makes it imperative to adopt a comprehensive land-use policy based on land capacity analysis that is scientific and practical. The main objective of this paper is to evolve an optimal land-use framework for the Gomti Watershed, situated in Kumaon, Lesser Himalaya. A detailed study of the traditional land use, regional agricultural system and the areas prone to environmental hazards was made throughout the watershed, through the preparation of large scale topographical forest and land record maps, field surveys and mapping. The average slope was considered as the principal parameter of land capacity, the potential for landslides and the intensity of erosion. Recognising the drastic changes that have taken place in the traditional land use, the watershed area has been proposed to be defined as protected forests (33.41%), community forests (32.86%), cultivation (23.33%) and horticulture (8.30%).

AB This article examines the increasing hazardousness of places as a consequence of natural disasters, technological failures and chronic environmental degradation on a global scale. The first part of the article describes the trends and impacts of environmental hazards, including their frequency, magnitude and damage on both a regional and an international scale. The article then details some of the confounding issues affecting hazard vulnerability including population change, urbanization, technological innovation, industrialization and wealth inequities. It concludes with a discussion on differential adjustments to environmental hazards and ways in which to improve the human condition.

AB Risk of Mycobacterium avium complex disease was examined in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with and without a history of tuberculosis, Information was obtained by retrospective review of charts of patients in HIV clinics in 10 US cities. Among 1363 patients with <200 CD4 cells/mm(3) seen at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), 11 (17%) of 66 with a history of a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test acquired M. avium infection, while 29 (16%) of 185 who were PPD-negative (but not anergic) did not (P = .85). Only 4 (8%) of 49 GMH patients with a history of tuberculosis acquired M. avium infection compared with 252 (19%) of 1314 GMH patients without a history of tuberculosis (P = .05), Proportional hazards analysis of risk factors for M. avium infection among 441 persons with and 8702 persons without a history of tuberculosis in 9 other cities confirmed protection from M. avium infection in persons with a history of tuberculosis (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.76; P < .001), Prior tuberculosis provides protection against M. avium infection in HIV-infected persons, possibly by stimulation of antimycobacterial immunity.

AB A recent surge in natural disaster losses in the United States has created widespread disruptions in the property insurance market and generated calls for federal protection against natural disaster risk. This article examines the market for disaster insurance in the United States and finds that insurance markets are limited in their ability to intertemporally diversify catastrophic risk. In a targeted response, this article proposes a new form of federal reinsurance based on the auctioning of multiple peril catastrophe call spread options that cover industry losses in the range of $25-$50 billion. This article argues that the sale of these catastrophe excess-of-loss contracts utilizes the unique intertemporal diversification capabilities of the federal government to expand the market for natural disaster risk while enhancing the private market equilibrium for insurance.

SP AIChE
AB Flash point determinations made from small-scale fire test apparatus are used by regulatory authorities to classify flammable and combustible liquids. Based on these classifications, regulators then specify or provide guidance on the appropriate methods to transport, handle, package, store, dispense, and protect these materials. Closed-cup flash points of flammable and combustible liquids are used to establish their appropriate classification. Exceptions to these classifications include products such as alcoholic beverages and medicines stored in relatively small containers, which have historically presented a limited fire hazard.
   Many companies are now reformulating their consumer liquid products to meet customer and regulatory demands for low volatile organic compounds (VOC's). Low VOC formulations often do not inherently result in the total elimination of flammable or combustible liquid solvents. In some cases, the reformulations results in ''water-reducible'' products, which contain a high water content. Water-reducible coatings are products where the solvent system used to disperse and suspend solids is primarily water. The remainder of the solvent system may contain liquids that are classified as flammable or combustible liquids that are classified as flammable or combustible liquids. A natural by-product of the ''water-reducible'' trend is the development of a fire analysis framework which could be adopted by regulatory authorities as part of the movement toward performance-oriented codes. This methodology could also be used to address limitations of specific test methods. These limitations relate to product viscosity, accuracy in predicting overall fire hazard, ability to assess physical changes of state when a product is tested, and test method reliability and ease of use.

AB After the successful use of 3-[4,5-(dimethylthiazol-2-yl)]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in cell proliferation assays, its use has been established by different workers in cytotoxicity assays and research on leukaemia. In the present study, a colorimetric assay using MTT was adopted to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of chicken intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs), which constitute an important cellular component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). These iIELs are found to exhibit natural killer (NK) cell-like cytotoxic activity, which is spontaneous, non-MHC-restricted, and does not need to be primed. Hitherto, conventional chromium-release assays have been used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of iIELs, but these assays have disadvantages such as radiation hazards and loss of the cells in washing steps. The mean percentage cytotoxic activity of chicken iIELs evaluated by the colorimetric assay was 90.37+/-2.53 in a group of 5-week-old chickens and 80.2+/-3.45 in a group of 8-week-old chickens. These findings established the successful use of a colorimetric assay using MTT for evaluating the cytotoxic activity of chickens iIELs.

AB Background There is indirect evidence that HIV-1 exposure does not inevitably lead to persistent infection. Heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection could be due to protective immunity. The objective of this study was to find out whether in highly HIV-1-exposed populations some individuals are resistant to infection.
   Methods We did an observational cohort study of incident HIV-1 infection among 424 initially HIV-1-seronegative prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya, between 1985 and 1994. 239 women seroconverted to HIV-1 during the study period. Exponential, Weibull, and mixture survival models were used to examine the effect of the duration of follow-up on incidence of HIV-1 infection. The influence of the duration of exposure to HIV-1 through prostitution on seroconversion risk was examined by Cox proportional hazards modelling, with control for other known or suspected risk factors for incident HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 PCR with env, nef, and vif gene primers was done on 43 persistently seronegative prostitutes who remained seronegative after 3 or more years of follow-up.
   Findings Modelling of the time to HIV-1 seroconversion showed that the incidence of HIV-1 seroconversion decreased with increasing duration of exposure, which indicates that there is heterogeneity in HIV-1. susceptibility or acquired immunity to HIV-1. Each weighted year of exposure through prostitution resulted in a 1.2-fold reduction in HIV-1 seroconversion risk (hazard ratio 0 . 83 [95% CI 0 . 79-0 . 88], p<0 . 0001). Analyses of epidemiological and laboratory data, show that persistent seronegativity is not explained by seronegative HIV-1 infection or by differences in risk factors for HIV-1 infection such as safer sexual behaviours or the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections.
   Interpretation We conclude that a small proportion of highly exposed individuals, who may have natural protective immunity to HIV-1, are resistant to HIV-1.

AB Background Mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet is difficult to manage, because it is frequently asymptomatic yet carries a high risk of left ventricular dysfunction and because the natural history of the condition is poorly defined.
   Methods We obtained clinical follow-up data through 1994-1995 in 229 patients with isolated mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet; this condition was first diagnosed by echocardiography between 1980 and 1989.
   Results The 86 patients who were treated medically had a mortality rate significantly higher than expected (6.3 percent yearly, P = 0.016 for the comparison with the expected rate in the U.S. population according to the 1990 census). independent determinants of mortality were an older age, the presence of symptoms, and a lower ejection fraction. Patients who were even transiently in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV had a high mortality rate (34 percent yearly), but the rate was also notable (4.1 percent yearly) among those in class I or ii. At 10 years, the mean (+/-SE) rates of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and death or surgery were 63+/-8, 30+/-12, and 90+/-3 percent, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, surgical correction of mitral regurgitation (performed in 143 patients) was associated with a reduced mortality rate (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.15 to 0.56; P<0.001).
   Conclusions When treated medically, mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet is associated with excess mortality and high morbidity. Surgery is almost unavoidable within 10 years after the diagnosis and appears to be associated with an improved prognosis; this finding suggests that surgery should be considered early in the course of the disease.

AB Responses of organisms to urbanization may involve adjustments in behavior. To qualify such behavioral plasticity we measured the degree to which gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exploited sunflower seeds in pans distributed over an urban-rural gradient of 78 sites in Virginia. Our objective was to use squirrel GUDs as a functional, relativistic measure of the effects of urbanization. Results showed that a higher proportion of pans were foraged from and that the GUDs were lower (more seeds were removed) in relatively high-density urban and suburban areas than in more rural agricultural areas, or in relatively human-free forest controls. For sites near or within human settlements, GUDs were lower nearer to human-occupied structures than at a greater distance from them, where more squirrels were observed, and where the density of trees was higher; GUDs were higher where there was substantial ground cover and where domestic pets (i.e., cats/dogs) were present nearby. Squirrels living in close proximity to humans appear to be either more limited by food or less sensitive to predatory risk than those living in more natural areas. We argue that the GUD represents a valuable metric with utility for measuring the separate and combined impact of anthropogenic actions at the individual and population levels.

AB Selenium concentration in soils depends on its content in parent rocks. Se compounds mobilization and their availability to plants and animals is controlled by redox and pH conditions in soils. Se immobilization in soils is due to the existence of chemosorption, chemosedimentation, reductive and evaporative geochemical barriers in soil profiles. Well-known natural biogeochemical Se anomalies are complemented by elevated Se concentrations in crops to Se technogenic input to the environment in the course of coal combustion. The highest values of Se technogenic input in Russia have been identified in the steppe zone (chemozems, chestnut soils), where the hazard of high concentrations of mobile, available for biota forms is considerable. Soils of Russia have been grouped in terms of their environmental-geochemical vulnerability and technogenic inertia for Se; geochemical associations and types of Se-pedobiomes have been specified.

AB Determining the extent and location of susface/near-surface structural deformation in the New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) is very important for evaluating earthquake hazards. A shallow shear-wave splitting experiment, located near the crest of the Lake County uplift (LCU) in the central NMSZ, shows the presence of near-surface azimuthal anisotropy believed to be associated with neotectonic deformation. A shallow four-component data set, recorded using a hammer and mass source, displayed abundant shallow reflection energy on records made with orthogonal source-receiver orientations, an indicator of shear-wave splitting. Following rotation of the data matrix by 40 degrees, the S-1 and S-2 sections (principal components of the data matrix) were aligned with the natural coordinate system at orientations of N35 degrees W and N55 degrees E, respectively. A dynamic mis-tie of 8 ms at a two-way traveltime of 375 ms produced an average azimuthal anisotropy of approximate to 2% between the target reflector (top of Quaternary gravel at a depth of 35 m) and the surface. Based on the shear-wave polarization data, two explanations for the azimuthal anisotropy in the study area are (1) fractures/cracks aligned in response to near-surface tensional stress produced by uplift of the LCU, and (2) faults/fractures oriented parallel to the Kentucky Bend scarp, a recently identified surface deformation feature believed to be associated with contemporary seismicity in the central NMSZ. In addition to increased seismic resolution by the use of shear-wave methods in unconsolidated, water-saturated sediments, measurement of near-surface directional polarizations, produced by shear-wave splitting, may provide valuable information for identifying neotectonic deformation and evaluating associated earthquake hazards.

AB Assessment is at the heart of teaching as it provides a necessary condition for judging success or failure. It is also necessary to ensure that providers of education are accountable to users and providers of resources. Inferential hazard is an inescapable part of any assessment procedure but cannot be an argument against assessment as such. Rich knowledge may be the aim of education but it does not follow that it is the aim of every stage of education. Teaching to tests is the most natural way of ensuring that teaching matches assessment. Failure to assess places public education in jeopardy.

AB A great amount of information is necessary to assess the risk of urban natural hazards. However, there is not enough information in many cases. If we use pure probabilistic methods to analyze the risk, unreliable results must be obtained. Therefore, we must employ fuzzy methods to study the risk. In this article we give an overview over advanced method to calculate the risk of release, exposure and consequence assessment. We present a case calculation to earthquake where we discuss particularly the way to calculate fuzzy risk of earthquake, site intensity, entity response, and losses of a city.

AB BACKGROUND. This study investigates whether a positive family history of breast carcinoma is associated with improved survival after invasive breast carcinoma among women ages 21 through 45.
   METHODS. Subjects were 733 nonadopted women born after 1944 who were diagnosed with primary invasive breast carcinoma between January 1983 and April 1990 while residing in the metropolitan Seattle area and who provided information on family history of breast carcinoma. Information on clinical characteristics and survival was obtained from a population-based cancer registry. Subjects were followed for survival through 1994. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of dying in relation to family history of breast carcinoma, adjusting for selected clinical characteristics, age and year of diagnosis, and prior mammograms.
   RESULTS. The risk of dying among women with a first-degree family history of breast carcinoma was half that of women with no family history of breast carcinoma (RR = 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3-0.9). There was no evidence of a reduction in the risk of dying among women with only a second-degree family history of breast carcinoma (RR = 1; 95% CI, 0.6-1.4). These associations were adjusted for age and year of diagnosis, stage of disease, tumor size, bilaterality, and mammogram history. These findings were not further influenced by adjustment for initial treatment or the numbers and ages of relatives at risk for breast carcinoma.
   CONCLUSIONS. Compared with women with neither a first- nor second-degree family history of breast carcinoma, the authors found that women who had a first-degree family history experienced increased survival. This finding did not appear to be attributable to differences in screening or treatment. To the extent that this difference is attributable to underlying biologic mechanisms, new insights into the natural history and treatment of breast carcinoma could result. Future studies should investigate whether specific susceptibility genes are associated with differential survival from breast carcinoma. (C) 1996 American Cancer Society.

AB The political economy of agriculture literature increasingly focuses research on production-consumption relations of different agro-food systems. This paper examines contextual pressures facing orchardists in the globally oriented apple complex of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. The paper details the emerging political economy of orcharding in the crisis conditions of the 1990s under the joint influences of globalization forces, interest in sustainability principles, and disruptive natural hazard events. New regulatory politics embracing apples is implicated in attempts to reinsert the regional apple complex into the global fresh fruit industry. Developments in Hawke's Bay are shown to be embedded in wider processes (including those of regulation) stretching across nations and are affected by conflicting spatialities of operational geographies of agents. Accommodating the risk of the apple sector appears to be closely tied to supportive networking in which investors are gradually refashioning the apple sector into a buyer- or consumer-driven production complex.

AB The damage caused to structures and other human endeavours, on or in the ground, by swelling clay soils is considered as a natural hazard. In order to mitigate this hazard an attempt was made to stabilize the swelling clay mineral structure by the addition of Mg(OH)(2). This will turn the swelling minerals, like montmorillonite, into non-swelling ones, e.g., chloride. Accordingly, the various factors affecting the precipitation-adsorption of the Mg-hydroxide by clays, was investigated, and the conditions giving the best results were established. The factors examined were: the base used as precipitant (NH4OH and NaOH); the preparation of the precipitate, inside or outside the clay suspension; the sequence and the duration of the reagents addition; the OH/Mg ratio; the time of clay-chemical contact; and the drying time and temperature. The method, was applied to different clay minerals (swelling and non-swelling). The material produced after the Mg-hydroxide precipitation was examined by the methylene blue dye adsorption test, XRD, DTA and DTGA methods; the results were treated statistically by factorial analysis. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the factors affecting the Mg-hydroxide adsorption by clays are: the base used as a precipitant, the preparation of the hydroxide directly inside or outside the clay suspension, the drying temperature, and the rate of titration of the reagents. Therefore, the best conditions for the laboratory preparation of hydroxy-Mg-interlayers are a dilute (1-2%) and well-dispersed clay suspension, pH between 10-12; some 12 meg Mg2+, as Mg-salt (e.g., MgCl2) per gram of clay, added before the base and followed by the dropwise titration of 1-2 N NaOH solution into the clay suspension, to give a molar ratio OH/Mg of about 1.5; vigorous agitation of the suspension during titration of the reagents; centrifugation and decantation of the supernatant liquid, and drying the product at about 250 degrees C. Satisfactory results are also obtained with the fast titration of the base and drying at 105 degrees C to complete dryness.

AB Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is the primary chemical hazard in natural gas production in 'sour' gas fields. It is also a hazard in sewage treatment and manure-containment operations, construction in wetlands, pelt processing, certain types of pulp and paper production, and any situation in which organic material decays or inorganic sulphides exist under reducing conditions. H2S dissociates into free sulphide in the circulation. Sulphide binds to many macromolecules, among them cytochrome oxidase. Although this is undoubtedly an important mechanism of toxicity due to H2S, there may be others. H2S provides little opportunity for escape at high concentrations because of the olfactory paralysis it causes, the sleep exposure-response relationships, and the characteristically sudden loss of consciousness it can cause which is colloquially termed 'knockdown.' Other effects may include mucosal irritation, which is associated at lower concentrations with a keratoconjunctivitis called 'gas eye' and at higher concentrations with risk of pulmonary oedema. Chronic central nervous system sequelae may possibly follow repeated knockdowns: this is controversial and the primary effects of H2S may be confounded by anoxia or head trauma. Treatment is currently empirical, with a combination of nitrite and hyperbaric oxygen preferred. The treatment regimen is not ideal and carries some risk.

AB Objective. To determine the incidence of HIV-related clinical findings, mortality and predictors of death in a cohort of HIV-exposed infants followed from birth.
   Methods. Data were collected approximately bimonthly during the first and second year of life and used in Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards survival analyses to predict time to the development of symptoms and death.
   Results. One hundred sixteen infected and 396 uninfected infants were followed for a median of 26 months at 7 New York City hospitals from 1986 to 1995. Two or more nonspecific HIV-related symptoms, AIDS or death occurred in 83% of infected children by the first year, Fifty infected infants (43%) developed AIDS and 19 (38%) of these had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Estimated median age at AIDS/death was 30 months and 64% of infected children remained alive and AIDS-free at 1 year. Estimated infant mortality among infected children was 160/1000 live births, and median survival after AIDS was 21 months; 55% of infected children survived >12 months after diagnosis of AIDS. P. carinii pneumonia was the most common cause of death. Although birth CD4 values did not predict AIDS or death, CD4 counts as early as 6 months of age were highly correlated with both. Thirteen (68%) of 19 infants who remained AIDS-free up to 3 to 6 months of age with CD4 count less than or equal to 1500 cells/mu l subsequently developed AIDS vs. 18 (30%) of 61 with CD4 count >1500 (P = 0.0001).
   Conclusions, Most HIV-1-infected infants develop disease in the first year of life. AIDS or death can be predicted by a threshold CD4 count of 1500 cells/mu l at 3 to 6 months of age.

AB From April-June 1993 the Weyerhaeuser Canada Limited pulp mill in Prince Albert, SK conducted a major upgrade of the lime kiln. This upgrade included installing the first FL Smidth Compax lime kiln product cooler in the world, a new CVS kiln burner, a new GL&V Ontario lime mud filter with the sequential blow cleaning system. As part of the upgrade a new feed belt conveyor, new feed screw, feed spirals and back end hood and ducting were installed. Dual layer refractory was installed in the kiln burning zone and a disturbed control system with all new instrumentation and a new flame safety system was installed. The benefits of the project include a reduction in heat and dust around the lime kiln discharge area which has reduced health and safety hazards in the area, an increase in lime kiln production which has lead to a reduction in purchased lime for the recausticizing plant with reduced lime mud being sent to landfill and reduced natural gas consumption.

AB A new parametric model is proposed for the regression analysis of relapse-free time data, It offers a natural classification of covariates in terms of their predominant effect either on the expected number of clonogens in a treated tumor or on the time of tumor progression. Within the framework of the model, the probability of local control is uniquely determined by the mean number of surviving clonogenic cells. Two versions of the model are considered; in one of them every mode of treatment is represented by indicator variables while in the other version the linear-quadratic model of radiation cell survival is used to describe the effect of radiotherapy. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters is provided by a nonlinear programming procedure which has been shown to be computationally tractable. The results are reported of the analysis of relevant data on breast cancer recurrence after conservative treatment of the primary tumor. The most striking finding is that age of a patient exerts a very strong effect on the mean number of surviving clonogens in the ipsilateral breast, or equivalently, the probability of tumor cure, while its effect on the progression time appears to be negligible. On the other hand, the primary tumor size contributes significantly to both characteristics of tumor latency. No significant covariate effects emerged from the analysis of the contralateral breast cancer recurrence.

AB Objective: To analyse plasma HIV-1 RNA levels as a marker of clinical stability and survival in a cohort of HIV-infected patients whose time of seroconversion is unknown.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Retrovirology laboratory and AIDS Unit in a teaching hospital.
   Patients: A total of 916 samples from 302 patients, most on antiretroviral therapy, were analysed. Mean initial CD4 cell counts and HIV-1 RNA were 299 x 10(6)/l (range: 0-1600) and 134 261 copies/ml (range: < 200-4 300 000), respectively. Sixty-six cases had been diagnosed previously with AIDS.
   Methods: Analysis of progression to AIDS and survival, according to initial and longitudinal viral load (VL) and CD4 cell count measurements was performed by Kaplan-Meier test. Relative risks were calculated by Cox's proportional hazards model.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 444 +/- 309 days, 29 patients developed AIDS and 21 died. Relative risk (RR) of progression related to the group with VL < 35 000 was: 10.4 when CD4 greater than or equal to 250 x 10(6)/l and VL greater than or equal to 35 000 (P = 0.001); and 45.3 when CD4 < 250 x 10(6)/l and VL greater than or equal to 35 000 (P < 0.0001). Cumulative probability of progression was: 0%, 0% and 12.3%, at the first, second and third year respectively, for patients with all their sequential VL determinations < 60 000; acid 13.3%, 34.7% and 79.3% for patients who did not maintain VL values always < 60 000 (RR = 23; P < 0.0001). The minimum value of VL that reached statistical significance for the survival analysis was 100 000 copies/ml (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: VL greater than or equal to or < 35 000 is a better discriminant for progression than a CD4 cell count greater than or equal to or < 250 x 10(6)/l. Sequential VL determinations < 60 000 are associated with a better prognosis.

AB Environmental exposure analysis may be used for a preliminary judgement - even in the absense of effect data - on the possible environmental behaviour of chemicals, based on relatively few, exactly measurable physico-chemical parameters from which the transfer between the media and (at least partly) also the degradation can be estimated. However, the data presently required by legislation (EU) are frequently based on concepts and experiences in the 70's, a period in which the highly lipophilic compounds were in the center of interest. Although these chemicals continue causing severe environmental problems, polar compounds have recently been identified as potentially dangerous substances. Therefore, it is to be expected that data requirements, testing procedures and modelling will have to be extended and improved in order to meet these new challenges. In order to identify the gaps in the present-day exposure analysis, the transfer- and degradations pathways and the most important parameters are identified and a survey of methods available for measuring the relevant parameters is attempted. Special emphasis is given to internationally agreed testing procedures (OECD). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB EuroGeoSurveys is a new European association constituted in 1995 by the Directors of the 15 national geological surveys of the European Union and includes the Norwegian Geological Survey It has developed from a previous grouping 21 Western European geological surveys (WEGS) but has a closer knit, more executive structure and a new mission to enable it to address European issues of common interest to the surveys. It will provide a permanent network between the surveys and promote the contribution of geoscience to improving the quality of life in the European Union and farther afield EuroGeoSurveys plans to use the huge information resources of the national geological surveys, gathered over an average of 119 years in each country, and the exercise of 6000 specialist staff, to provide focused advice to European Union decision-makers and policy planners on realistic future options for issues involving natural resources, the environment and natural hazards. EuroGeoSurveys plans to propose scenarios for concerted action in these fields by surveys, decision-makers from the European Union institutions, governments and industrial and environmental organisations. A Bureau, opened in Brussels in January 1996, will promote continuous information exchange with these bodies.

AB The fungal population on dry-cured Iberian ham can be essential to the development of the product's unique characteristics, but health hazards due to mycotoxins may be significant. We examined the natural fungal population of Iberian hams during ripening at three different locations. Chloroform extracts from 59 selected isolates were tested for toxicity to brine shrimp larvae and VERO cells, for mutagenicity in the Ames test and for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The diversity of moulds increased during ripening. Penicillium commune, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Penicillium expansum and Penicillium echinulatum dominated most of the ripening time; however, the Eurotium species, particularly E. herbariorum and E. repens, increased in the final product. Using the above tests, most moulds were toxigenic. The toxigenic potential of the fungal population increased as the processing progressed. To minimize health hazards from uncontrolled fungal populations; we identified non toxigenic strains of Penicillium chrysogenum that could be used as starters in dry-cured hams.

AB In maximizing the net total government take from exploitation of nonrenewable natural resource endowments, the government faces the problem that extraction companies possess private information about extraction capacities (adverse selection). In a repeated auctions model, I show that it is optimal to deviate from bidding parity, even in the absence of moral hazard. The second period auction is biased to mitigate the externality problem that stems from intertemporal dynamics in extraction costs.

AB The paper has been entitled Opportunities and Constraints in Monitoring of Chemical Hazards by Religious Organizations' for several reasons. First, by 'opportunities' I do not refer to the practical or effective commitment of religious groups to the monitoring of chemical hazards, but rather I indicate some of the church documents which encourage the faithful and, therefore, religious groups to be committed to the protection and conservation of the environment or to the improvement of humankind's relations to natural resources. Second, by 'constraint' I wish to describe what is being done and I must immediately state that what is being done is rarely related to the monitoring of chemical hazards.

AB Sixty-four consecutive patients with disseminated midgut carcinoids sere treated during an 8-gear period according to a single clinical protocol aimed at aggressive tumor reduction by surgery alone or with subsequent hepatic artery embolization. All patients had markedly elevated urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels (581 +/- 79 mu mol/24 h) and hormonal symptoms. Fourteen patients (22%) reached anatomic and biochemical cure by surgery alone. At follow-up, the mean 5-HIAA levels were still normal after 69.0 +/- 6.2 months; two patients had died from unrelated causes. With the introduction of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, subclinical disease was diagnosed in 7 of these 14 patients. Forty patients with bilobar hepatic disease underwent embolization in combination with octreotide. In this group, 5-HIAA levels were still reduced by 55% after 71 +/- 11 months of follow-up, and the 5-year survival was 56%, estimated from the total death hazard function. After embolization, two subgroups could be identified with marked differences in their long-term response to treatment. Ten patients were not embolized owing to complicating diseases. The 5-year survival for the entire series was 58%. A significantly increased risk of cardiovascular deaths was seen, which underlines the importance of total survival analysis in a disease with multiple hormonal effects. It is concluded that an active surgical approach must be recommended to patients with the midgut carcinoid syndrome. In patients with bilobar hepatic disease, embolization combined with octreotide treatment markedly reduced the 5-HIAA excretion and suggested a prolonged 5-year survival.

AB Bubble growth in an ascending parcel of magma is controlled both by diffusion of oversaturated volatiles and decompression as the magma rises. We have developed a numerical model which explores the processes involved in water exsolution from basaltic and rhyolitic melts rising at a constant rate from magma chamber depths of 4 and 1 km. While the model does not attempt to simulate natural eruptions, it sheds light on the processes which control eruptive behavior under various conditions. Ascent rates are defined such that a constant rate of decompression dP/dt is maintained. A variety of initial ascent rates are considered in the model, from 1 m/s to 100 m/s for basalts, and from a few centimeters per second to 10 m/s for rhyolite, at the base of the conduit. The model results indicate that for any reasonable ascent rate, basaltic melt degasses at a rate sufficient to keep the dissolved volatile concentration at equilibrium with the decreasing ambient pressure. Rhyolitic melt reaches the surface at equilibrium if its ascent rate is less than 1 m/s, but it can erupt with high oversaturation at greater ascent rates. The latter may lead to explosive eruptions. If the ascent rate of rhyolite is 10 m/s or more, then melt barely degasses at all in the conduit and erupts with the highest oversaturation possible. For the case of slow magma rise, bubble growth is limited by decompression. For the case of rapid magma rise, bubble growth is limited by diffusion. The results of our simple model do not accurately simulate natural volcanic eruptions, but suggest that subsequent, more complex models may be able to simulate eruptions using the insights regarding diffusive and decompressive bubble growth processes explored in this study. Numerical modeling of volcanic degassing may eventually lead to better prediction of eruption timing, energetics and hazards of active volcanoes.

TI Prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex with weekly
   azithromycin, daily rifabutin, or both

DT Article

AB Background Azithromycin is active in treating Mycobacterium avium complex disease, but it has not been evaluated as primary prophylaxis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Because the drug is concentrated in macrophages and has a long half-life in tissue, there is a rationale for once-weekly dosing.
   Methods We compared three prophylactic regimens in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial involving 693 HIV-infected patients with fewer than 100 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter. The patients were assigned to receive rifabutin (300 mg daily), azithromycin (1200 mg weekly), or both drugs. They were monitored monthly with blood cultures for M. avium complex.
   Results In an intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of disseminated M. avium complex infection at one year was 15.3 percent with rifabutin, 7.6 percent with azithromycin, and 2.8 percent with both drugs. The risk of the infection in the azithromycin group was half that in the rifabutin group (hazard ratio, 0.53; P=0.008). The risk was even lower when two-drug prophylaxis was compared with rifabutin alone (hazard ratio, 0.28; P<0.001) or azithromycin alone (hazard ratio, 0.53; P=0.03). Among the patients in whom azithromycin prophylaxis was not successful, 11 percent of M. avium complex isolates were resistant to azithromycin. Dose-limiting toxic effects were more common with the two-drug combination than with azithromycin alone (hazard ratio, 1.67; P=0.03). Survival was similar in all three groups.
   Conclusions For protection against disseminated M. avium complex infection, once-weekly azithromycin is more effective than daily rifabutin and infrequently selects for resistant isolates. Rifabutin plus azithromycin is even more effective but is not as well tolerated. (C) 1996, Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB Swine confinement farming is associated with an increased risk of respiratory morbidity. Adverse health effects have been shown in association with levels of dust, endotoxins, and ammonia. This study was conducted to evaluate characteristics of confinement farms associated with respiratory morbidity in order to establish priorities for preventive measures. A questionnaire on symptoms and farm characteristics was completed by 1,432 male swine confinement farmers. Of these, 200 with and 200 without chronic respiratory symptoms were randomly selected for lung function testing. A significantly increased risk for chronic respiratory symptoms was shown if farmers used wood-shavings as bedding (prevalent odds ratio [FOR] 2.2), used disinfectants (FOR 1.7), used natural ventilation (FOR 2.6), had floor types other than slatted or half-slatted (FOR 2.1), or used a mechanical feeding system (FOR 1.4). Lung function (FEV(1)) was significantly lower with increasing numbers of years worked (51 ml/10 years), with smaller numbers of pigs (8.5 ml/100 pigs), and when the air outlet of the ventilation system was via the pit (248 ml). To decrease the risk of respiratory morbidity the following preventive measures are proposed: discouragement of the use of disinfectants and of wood-shavings as bedding, and promotion of the use of mechanical ventilation systems.

SO CANCER

DT Article
DE colorectal carcinoma; curative resection; disease free survival rate;
   prognostic factor
ID COLORECTAL-CANCER
AB BACKGROUND. The prognostic factors and natural history of recurrence in patients with colorectal carcinoma who underwent curative resection and no other therapy were analyzed.
   METHODS. The object of analysis was the potentially curative resection only subgroup in the randomized clinical trial (RCT) that we performed. Cox's proportional hazards model was used mainly to analyze recurrence rates during the first 5 years after surgery.
   RESULTS. The analysis was performed on a subgroup of the RCT (279 patients with colon carcinoma and 293 patients with rectal carcinoma). Five-year disease free survival rates were 76.3% and 56.5% for colon and rectal carcinomas, respectively. The prognostic factors for recurrence for colon carcinoma patients were different from those with rectal carcinoma. For colon carcinoma, only Dukes stage was significant, whereas for rectal carcinoma, Dukes stage, age, location of the tumor, and serosal and venous invasion by cancer cells were prognostic factors. Log-transformed disease free survival rates were linear in Dukes Stage B and biphasic in Dukes Stage C for both colon and rectal carcinoma. The two phases in Dukes Stage C intersected at 2.85 and 3.04 years, respectively. The annual hazard value was high for the first 3 years in both colon and rectal carcinoma.
   CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that follow-up of patients with colorectal carcinoma who undergo potentially curative resection is of particular importance in the first 3 years after surgery. Furthermore, the usefulness of adjuvant chemotherapy can be adequately evaluated from data yielded during this postoperative period.

AB Black coal excavation from most coal mines in Poland is accompanied by discharge of highly saline drainage water to the surface waters. To avoid this ecological hazard, various technologies were considered during 1990-92. Technical requirements, presented in this paper, led to the choice of technology of thermal desalination with the carnallite method. Advantages of this method have been presented including low salinity of treated water and the possibility of practical application of the process by-products as substrate for the chemical industry. Authors discuss possible risk associated with this method such as negative impact of energy production (for purposes of desalination) on the natural environment or surpassing of desalination by-products.

AB Alterations in hood flows of the Raba River are examined to determine the influence exerted on flood waves by changing morphological conditions. With stable vertical channel position, the river increased its sinuosity during the 1920s to 1940s, and the change was accompanied by a growing tendency to flood-wave attenuation. The temporal change in flood-wave transformation is typical of a developing low-flow system. Subsequently, streambed degradation has been induced due to channnelization works which straightened and narrowed the river. Flood waves became progressively more flashy as channel incision progressed. The increase in magnitude of flood waves passing the deepened reach was greatest for bankfull flows and diminished for lower in-bank flows and higher overbank flows.
   The tendency to magnification of peak discharges has been also found in other Carpathian rivers which were considerably degraded in the 20th century in response to channelization. Introducing an empirically found correcting factor into the analysis of the ratio of outflow to inflow peak discharges shows how the conditions of peak-flow transformation in a reach have changed since the beginning of the study period. A marked coincidence between changes in vertical channel location and variations in the 'corrected' peak-discharge ratio proves channel changes to be a very important reason for the growing flood hazard in southern Poland.
   Gradient oversteepening and channel narrowing, caused by channelization,lead to formation of a river system having a steep, straight, narrow and deep channel. Such a morphology distinguishes the system from natural low-flow and high-flow systems. Reduced floodplain water storage and self-acceleration of flow concentrated in a channel zone make flood waves progressively more flashy on their way down the channelization-formed system.

SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

DT Article
DE major hazard; mathematical model; quality assurance
AB This paper presents a Quality-Assurance-based technique for evaluating the quality of a Mathematical Model used to calculate the consequences of Major Hazards. It starts by considering that the diversity of, and the discrepancies between, mathematical models today, in addition to the diversity of user categories, makes it necessary to seek clarification from modellers on the quality procedures adopted at the different stages of model development. Too often, these procedures are not sufficiently described, leading to obscurity and the possibility of misuse of the model or over-confidence in its predictions. We intend to offer the community of end-users in a broad sense, a structure for eliciting information from modellers which would enable the users to judge the quality of an environmental software without having to invest too much in the different facets of its realisation: the scientific and the algorithmic background, its computerisation, its validation and its sensitivity to internal parameters and, finally the quality of its user interface. If it is quite natural to accept the wide gulf between fundamental research prototypes and industrially oriented codes, it is, however, necessary to get reliable and robust measurement tools capable of judging their maturity, their domain of applicability and their limitations. Although the questionnaire-based technique presented in this work is applicable to a wider area than just the Major Hazard Environmental software, we preferred, as a start, to stick to this particularly important topic.

   susceptibility
AB Allergic hypersensitization to a variety of chemicals, natural and synthetic, is a worldwide health problem. Respiratory tract hypersensitization is responsible for significant morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. An important step in managing and controlling health risks, such as allergic hypersensitization, is to identify the chemical hazard, define dose-effect and dose-response relationships, evaluate exposure, and characterize risk. In practical terms, the risk and safety assessment processes lead to the designation of control limits for exposure to chemicals in air, food, water, and consumer products. The objective of exposure limits is to protect the whole human population, including the most susceptible individuals and 'at risk' groups. The existence of susceptible individuals is a factor that must be taken into account when quantitative chemical risk assessments are being made, and should be covered in the risk characterization. Within a population, individual susceptibility is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and these have regional and national differences. There may be cases where hypersusceptible individuals and groups, such as asthmatic children, are not fully protected by regulatory exposure limits. The International Programme on Chemical Safety, as the global programme on identifying and assessing chemical risks to human health and the environment in order to assist countries in effective management, is striving to elucidate the toxicological basis for chemically-associated disease and advance the basic science and methodology of chemical risk and safety assessment.

AB Background: As a general rule, surgery whenever possible, followed by irradiation is considered to be the standard treatment for cancer of the hypopharynx, thus sacrificing natural speech. In most patients, surgery includes removal of the larynx. Purpose: A prospective, randomized phase III study was conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) starting in 1990 to compare a larynx-preserving treatment (induction chemotherapy plus definitive, radiation therapy in patients who showed a complete response or surgery in those who did not respond) with conventional treatment (total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, radical neck dissection, and postoperative irradiation) in previously untreated and operable patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinomas of the pyriform sinus or aryepiglottic fold, but free of other cancers. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1) immediate surgery with postoperative radiotherapy (50-70 Gy) or 2) induction chemotherapy (cisplatin [100 mg/m(2)] given as a bolus intravenous injection on day 1, followed by infusion of fluorouracil [1000 mg/m(2) per day] on days 1-5). An endoscopic evaluation was performed after each cycle of chemotherapy. After two cycles, only partial and complete responders received a third cycle. Patients with a complete response after two or three cycles of chemotherapy were treated thereafter by irradiation (70 Gy); nonresponding patients underwent conventional surgery with postoperative radiation (50-70 Gy). Salvage surgery was also performed when patients relapsed after chemotherapy and irradiation. The trial was designed to test the equivalence of the two treatment arms; i.e., the induction chemotherapy treatment would be judged equivalent to immediate surgery if the relative risk of death for induction chemotherapy compared with immediate surgery was significantly less than 1.43 using a one-sided hypothesis test at the .05 level of significance. Results: Two hundred two patients entered the trial and were randomly assigned; only 194 were eligible for treatment (94 in the immediate-surgery arm and 100 in the induction-chemotherapy arm). In the induction-chemotherapy arm, complete response was seen in 52 (54%) of 97 patients with local disease (primary tumor) and in 31 (51%) of 61 patients with regional disease (involvement of the neck). Treatment failures at local, regional, and second primary sites occurred at approximately the same frequencies in the immediate-surgery arm (12%, 19%, and 16%, respectively) and in the induction-chemotherapy arm (17%, 23%, and 13%, respectively). In contrast, there were fewer failures at distant sites in the induction-chemotherapy arm than in the immediate-surgery arm (25% versus 36%, respectively; P = .041). The median duration of survival was 25 months in the immediate-surgery arm and 44 months in the induction-chemotherapy arm and, since the observed hazard ratio was 0.86 (logrank test, P = .006), which was significantly less than 1.43, the two treatments were judged to be equivalent. The 3- and 5-year estimates of retaining a functional larynx in patients treated in the induction-chemotherapy arm were 42% (95% confidence interval 31%-53%) and 35% (95% confidence interval = 22%-48%), respectively.
   Conclusions and Implications: Larynx preservation without jeopardizing survival appears feasible in patients with cancer of the hypopharynx. On the basis of these observations, the EORTC has now accepted the use of induction chemotherapy followed by radiation as the new standard treatment in its future phase III larynx preservation trials.

AB This review examines the potential for gene exchange in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) likely to be released into the environment. It considers both indirect and direct evidence for the exchange of genetic information in organisms and those circumstances where it may occur. The available scientific evidence indicates that horizontal transfer among divergent organisms in nature is not so infrequent that it can be dismissed, nor does it occur at a frequency comparable to related organisms. in considering the release of genetically modified microorganisms into the environment DNA is more likely to be transferred between members of the same genus. There are numerous reports which show some conjugation, transduction and transformation systems may have broader host ranges than considered previously. There are established examples of interkingdom exchange between microorganisms and plants. The reverse process between some organisms indicates the potential for horizontal transfer may be greater than thought previously. Gene exchange may be a hazard but its consequences for the environment are likely to be dependent on the transferred gene and the expression of its trait in recipient organisms (plants or microorganisms) which acquire a selective advantage.

AB Most currently recognized occupational exposure limits do not consider reproductive toxicological end points consistently when establishing recommended exposure limits. In many cases the information is not available, but perhaps as often, existing data is not employed. Further, many manufacturer's material safety data sheets omit reproductive hazard information. A method for identifying potential reproductive toxins and screening levels for associated health risks useful for hazard communication and exposure control is presented. To date, the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances lists between 5000 and 6000 chemicals, drugs, and natural substances that show a positive outcome in at least 1 reproductive effects study. This reproductive health risk assessment began with these substances. Using elements of the Environmental Protection Agency's health risk assessment process,the list was reduced to 213 chemicals during the hazard identification step. Occupational reproductive guidelines (ORGs) were developed in the dose-response evaluation step. At the time of this writing, 85% of the chemicals identified in the hazard identification step have had a screening level dose-response assessment completed. Of these, 13% are greater than or equal to a threshold limit value (TLV(R)). The remaining 87% do not have a TLV or ORGs below the TLV. The reproductive toxins list, a long with the corresponding dose-response-derived ORGs that have been completed, appears at the end of the text.

AB This study examines the relationship between fatal breast cancer and use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) among women in a large prospective study in the United States. After nine years of follow-up, 1,469 breast cancer deaths were observed in a cohort of 422,373 postmenopausal women who were cancer free at study entry and who supplied information on estrogen use Results from Cox proportional hazards modeling, adjusted for 11 other potential risk factors, showed that ever-use of ERT was associated with a significantly decreased risk of fatal breast cancer (rate ratio [RR] = 0.84, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.75-0.94). There was a moderate trend (P = 0.07) of decreasing risk with younger age at first use of ERT. This decreased risk was most pronounced in women who experienced natural menopause before the age of 40 years (RR = 0.59, CI = 0.40-0.87). There was no discernible trend of increasing risk with duration of use in estrogen users at baseline or former users, nor was there any trend in years since last use in former users. The relationship between ERT and breast cancer mortality differed by age at menarche and by a self-reported history of breast cysts. No increased risk of fatal breast cancer with ERT was observed with estrogen use status (baseline/former), age at first use, duration of use, or years since last use. These findings suggest that ever-use of ERT is associated with a 16 percent decreased risk of fatal breast cancer.

AB Syncrude Canada Ltd is developing new concepts in lease-closure landscape design for its Oil Sands leases 17 and 22 in northeastern Alberta. Closure planning is becoming an integral part of the planning cycles and of the lease operation. By incorporating closure planning into the day-to-day operation, the company will achieve acceptable lease closure in an economical manner. Ultimately, Syncrude will achieve lower operating costs through innovation in mine planning and a reduction in residual liabilities.
   New concepts being evaluated for lease-closure landscape design include: designing for closure, use of landforms and natural analogs, self-armouring bouldery ground, robustness in design, landform grading, terrain analysis of reclaimed land, geotechnical hazard assessments, choices in closure design timeframes, passive maintenance, determining post-closure monitoring goals, engineering tailings, engineering other substrates, use of test plots and field demonstrations, geomorphologic monitoring of reclaimed lands, defining closure goals, and visiting other mines. These concepts are being formalized under the new discipline of landscape Engineering.

DE water control; floodplain; fisheries; Bangladesh; Chandpur
AB Bangladesh is a very flat delta built up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna/Barak river systems. Because of its geographical location, floods cause huge destruction of lives and properties almost every year. Water control programs have been undertaken to enhance development through mitigating the threat of disasters. This structural approach to flood hazard has severely affected floodplain fisheries that supply the major share of protein to rural Bangladesh, as exemplified by the Chandpur irrigation Project. Although the regulated environment of the Chandpur project has become favorable for closed-water cultured fish farming, the natural open-water fishery loss has been substantial. Results from research show that fish yields were better under preproject conditions. Under project conditions per capita fish consumption has dropped significantly, and the price of fish has risen beyond the means of the poor people, so that fish protein in the diet of poor people is gradually declining. Bangladesh is planning to expand water control facilities to the remaining flood-prone areas in the next 15-20 years. This will cause further loss of floodplain fisheries. If prices for closed-water fish remain beyond the buying power of the poor, alternative sources of cheap protein will be required.

AB Radiation and radionuclides are natural phenomena. Small quantities of radionuclides, for example, are always released into the environment when materials are burnt or heated. Large-scale conventional energy sources such as coal and nuclear power have been well investigated for many years with regard to the emission of radionuclides, while emissions from the combustion of pent and wood and from other non-nuclear industries have not been investigated to the same extent. Ebr the nuclear industry in Sweden, the annual dose limit to the public arising from regulated outlets to air and water must not exceed 0.1 mSv year(-1) and the global collective effective dose must not exceed 5 person Sv year(-1) per GW. A proposed radiation limit for pent power plants in Sweden is also 0.1 mSv year(-1). Like most human pursuits, power-generating and other industrial activities affect the environment negatively but the radiation hazard is generally small compared with other hazards and natural radiation.

AB Aims and Background: The role of radiotherapy in the management of patients with optic pathway tumors remains controversial. This study analyzes the outcome of patients treated with radiotherapy and attempts to identify the groups of patients that may require early therapy, Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 36 patients with optic pathway tumors treated with radiotherapy alone (26 patients) or with postoperative radiotherapy (10 patients). Seven patients had optic nerve tumors and 29 patients had chiasmal tumors. The actuarial progression free survival and observed survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences between curves were evaluated by the Mantel-Cox test. The obtained significant variables in the univariate analysis were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The 10-year actuarial progression-free survival (10-y PFS) rate was 86% for patients with optic nerve gliomas and 47% for patients with chiasmal tumors. The 10-year actuarial observed survival (10-y OS) rate was 75% for patients with optic nerve gliomas and 53% for patients with chiasmal gliomas. In the group of patients with chiasmal tumors, progression-free survival and observed survival rates were significantly lower in infants (10-y PFS: 30%; 10-y OS: 37%), in patients with neurological deficits 10-y PFS and 10-y OS: 23%), in patients with signs of elevated intracranial pressure (10-y PFS and 10-y OS: 9%), with hydrocephalus (10-y PFS and 10-y OS: 0%), or with impairment of consciousness (10-y PFS and 10-y OS: 17%). Evaluation by computed tomography scanning was associated with a significantly higher probability of PFS. Radiation doses lower than 50 Gy were associated with significantly lower PFS and OS rates. In the Cox multivariate analysis, presence of neurological deficits and radiation dose significantly influenced observed survival. Presence of hydrocephalus significantly influenced progression-free survival. Conclusions: The prognosis of patients with chiasmal gliomas presenting with neurologic deficits is poor and should be treated at diagnosis. A minimum tumor dose of 50 Gy is recommended.

TI Predictors of survival in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients

ID HIV-INFECTION; PATHOGENESIS; EXPRESSION; COHORT
AB Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has changed both the epidemiology and natural history of tuberculosis. Despite a generally good response to effective antituberculous therapy, the prognosis remains poor. The objective of this analysis was to determine the independent predictors of survival in HIV-infected Ugandan adults with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. A total of 191 HIV-infected Ugandan adults with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled into a clinical trial of chemotherapy for tuberculosis. The subjects received either rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid for six months (n = 101) or streptomycin, thiacetazone, and isoniazid for two months followed by thiacetazone and isoniazid for eight months (n = 90). After standard measurements were made at baseline, the group was followed at regular intervals for a mean of 16 months to determine survival. During the course of follow-up, 82 (43%) of the patients died, six within the first month of therapy. The one-year survival proportion was 68% with an estimated median survival of 26 months and did not differ according to treatment regimen. The hazard for death was biphasic, high early in the course of therapy, and then again after about one year. After controlling for the treatment regimen, four independent predictors of survival were found: anergy to purified protein derivative, atypical chest roentgenogram, previous HIV-related condition, and lymphopenia. In this cohort of Ugandan adults, four simple and inexpensive predictors of survival were found. These factors suggest that the degree of immunosuppression was a major determinant of survival.

AB The natural environment has been shown to vary at both large and small scales. As the relationship between seed mass and the growth of subsequent plants varies depending on the environment. it is important to study the effects of seed mass on plant growth across environments for a better understanding of the ecological significance of seed mass. In this study, the effects of seed mass on the growth of Cakile edentula, an annual growing in the sand dunes along the Great Lakes, was examined across a wide range of soil nutrient, moisture levels, and depths of sand burial under controlled greenhouse conditions. The development of plants, such as time of true leaf production, flower bud formation, and fruit maturation, was faster in proportion to the original seed mass of the plants across all of the tested environmental factors. As drastic environmental variations prevail in beach sand dune systems, quick development and early reproductive growth of plants from the large seeds would enable them to survive sand burial and escape natural hazards. It is concluded that seed mass has significant effects on the performance of C. edentula across a wide range of environmental variation. (C) 1996 Annals of Botany Company.

SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY

DT Article
ID GENES; STAPHYLOCOCCUS; STRAINS; PROBES
AB Iberian ham is an uncooked, cured meat product ripened under natural uncontrolled conditions for 18 to 24 months, Gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci are the main microbial population in Iberian ham for most of the ripening time, Since some of these organisms are able to produce enterotoxins, adequate characterization and toxicological study are needed, For this, 1,327 gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, isolated from Iberian hams at different stages and locations, were characterized by physiological and biochemical tests, Selected isolates were further characterized by guanine-cytosine (G+C) content and restriction enzyme analysis of genes coding for 16S rRNA, The toxigenic potential of these organisms was tested with specific DNA gene probes for staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C, and D and confirmed by semiquantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay, The majority of the isolates were identified as Staphylococcus spp. and Micrococcus spp, Nonidentified gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci which were moderately halophilic and showed a 42 td 52% G+C content were detected, A great variety of staphylococcal strains were found within the different species at any sampling time, Two strains of Staphylococcus xylosus, one Staphylococcus cohnii strain, and four of the nonidentified organisms with 42 to 52% G-l-C contents hybridized with some of the DNA probes for C and D staphylococcal enterotoxin genes, S. xylosus hybridizing with C-enterotoxin probe reacted with both C and D enterotoxins in the immunological test; In addition, enterotoxin D was confirmed in the nonidentified strains, Some toxigenic organisms were isolated from the final product, posing a health hazard for the consumer.

TI Focusing on Hurricane Andrew through the eyes of the victims
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB Focus group techniques are especially useful hi the study of human responses to natural hazards, because of their ability to incorporate context, their open-ended format, and their ability to derive qualitative insights. We convened two focus groups in South Dade County, Florida, to probe reactions to hurricane Andrew's devastation in August of 1992. Based on focus group conversations, me were able to elucidate emergency behaviours as they relate to: first the diversity of attitudes and perceptions characteristic of the pre-impact period; secondly tire emergence of therapeutic and parasitic communities in the post-impact period; and thirdly the coping innovations associated with the need to begin recovery. Such behavioural insights need to be incorporated in the emergency planning process to assure preparedness and to facilitate the recovery operation.

   vibrations; stochastic dynamic analysis
ID RANDOM VIBRATION; RANDOM-EXCITATION; FRAMES
AB Many types of structural systems that undergo cycles of inelastic deformation under severe natural hazard loadings exhibit 'pinching' of hysteresis loops. In this paper, a generally pinching hysteretic restoring force model-an extension of the Bouc-Wen differential hysteresis model-is used in stochastic equivalent linearization of single-degree-of-freedom structural systems. The severity and rate of pinching are controlled by the hysteretic energy dissipation and the pinching level can be specified to match experimental data. Under white noise excitations, estimates of reponse statistics from linearization are shown to compare favourably with those from Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical studies on the sensitivity of the accuracy of response statistics obtained by linearization to changes in the hysteresis parameters showed that, for a range of practical cases, the linearization method can be used in lieu of simulation and that, in low-frequency systems, some hysteresis parameters may be set to a constant value a priori to reduce the number of model parameters that needs to be estimated or identified, and to simplify further random vibration analysis and/or performance evaluation studies.

AB The profiles of patients with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) from developing countries have not been reported earlier. The current study was conducted prospectively, at a single tertiary care center in India, to document the demographic and clinical characteristics, natural course, and causative profile of-patients with FHF as well as to define simple prognostic markers in these patients. Four hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with FHF admitted from January 1987 to June 1993 were included in the study. Each patient's serum was tested for various hepatotropic viruses. Univariate Cox's regression for 28 variables, multivariate Cox's proportional hazard regression, stepwise logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were done to identify independent predictors of outcome at admission. All patients presented with encephalopathy within 4 weeks of onset of symptoms. Hepatotropic viruses were the likely cause in most of these patients. Hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis D (HDV) viruses, and antitubercular drugs could be implicated as the cause of FHF in 1.7% (n = 7), 28% (n = 117), 3.8% (n = 16), and 4.5% (n = 19) patients, respectively, In the remaining 62% (n = 264) of patients the serological evidence of HAV, HBV, or HDV infection was lacking, and none of them had ingested hepatotoxins. FHF was presumed to be caused by non-A, non-B virus(es) infection Sera of 50 patients from the latter group were tested for hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA and HCV RNA. In 31 (62%), HEV could be implicated as the causative agent, and isolated HCV RNA could be detected in 7 (19%). Two hundred eighty-eight (66%) patients died. Approximately 75% of those who died did so within 72 hours of hospitalisation. One quarter of the female patients with FHF were pregnant. Mortality among pregnant females, nonpregnant females, and male patients with FHF was similar (P > .1). Univariate analysis showed that age, size of the liver assessed by percussion, grade of coma, presence of clinical features of cerebral edema, presence of infection, serum bilirubin, and prothrombin time prolongation over controls at admission were related to survival (P < .01). The rapidity of onset of encephalopathy and cause of FHF did not influence the outcome. Cox's proportional hazard regression showed age greater than or equal to 40 years, presence of cerebral edema, serum bilirubin greater than or equal to 15 mg/dL, and prothrombin time prolongation of 25 seconds or more over controls were independent predictors of outcome. Ninety-three percent of the patients with three or more of the above prognostic markers died. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value of the presence of three or more of these prognostic factors for mortality was 93%, 80%, 86%, and 89.5%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 87.3%. We conclude that most of our patients with FHF might have been caused by hepatotropic viral infection, and non-A, non-B virus(es) seems to be the dominant hepatotropic viral infection among these patients. They presented with encephalopathy within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms. Pregnancy, cause, and rapidity of onset of encephalopathy did not influence survival. The prognostic model developed in the current study is simple and can be performed at admission.

TI Gas hydrate exploration: Its technology-environment interface in the
   world and Japan
SO HITOTSUBASHI JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

ID CARBON; SEA
AB Ice-like gas hydrates under deep ocean bottom and permafrost have been attracting vigorous attention of geologists and energy industries world-wide in recent years. Such clathrate compounds are expected to become an environmentally sound, future source of energy. However, its research and development, if recklessly made, may cause such hazards as disturbance of marine environment, additional green house effect due to methane escape into the atmosphere and so on. After glimpses at the world and Japanese histories of natural gas utilization and at the Jevons' law on economy of fuel, this paper will investigate the current state of technology-environment interface of deep ocean drilling to gas-hydrate-containing sediments. A tentative map of gas hydrate evidences around Japan Archipelago is shown. Finally, needs for disclosure of empirical data and extensive environmental assessment will be discussed in the context of new drilling and related technologies.

TI Kobe and Northridge - Two earthquakes compared
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The earthquakes striking Northridge, California in 1994 and Kobe, Japan just a year later highlighted the vulnerability of modern cities to natural hazards. The Northridge quake affected a suburban area, consisting of a mixture of residential and commercial districts but having no industrial plants of any great size. In Kobe, by contrast, the entire urban area, having a high concentration of population and buildings in the city centre, major industrial plants, and a large port area, was hit. This fact, and the higher price levels in Japan, explain why the extent of the losses in Kobe was significantly higher. The Kobe tremor demonstrated that much more attention must be paid in future to reinforcing important older buildings or buildings that are especially at risk. The fact that many modern high rise buildings survived intact showed that it is possible to design earthquake resistant structures, although the safety of steel frame structures, hitherto thought to be good, is now more questionable. Theories predicting that a similar event in a conurbation such as San Francisco or Tokyo-Yokohama could affect the entire world economy must now be viewed as having greater credibility.

AB The activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in building materials applied in the State of Kuwait were measured in order to asses the radiological hazard from that source. The samples of raw materials: soil, sand, gypsum and cement as well as different kinds of concrete or bricks were analyzed by gamma-ray spectrometry with a HPGe detector. The radium equivalent activity concentrations in the samples varied between 4.2 to 283 Bq kg(-1). This value is generally significantly lower than the value of 370 Bq kg(-1) which corresponds to an annual external radiation dose inside dwellings equal to 1.5 mSv. The hazard from external gamma-radiation of building materials has been found to be comparable to that from external gamma-fields of primordial radionuclides in the surface soil of Kuwait.

TI Effect of temperature on physical and mechanical properties of concrete

SO CEMENT AND CONCRETE RESEARCH

AB Fire is one of the natural hazards which attack building construction. The damage in buildings which continuously exposed to fire are caused due to its high temperature. Thus the effect of high temperatures on physical and mechanical properties of concrete was investigated. In this study ordinary Portland cement has been partially replaced by ratios of silica fume. The heat treatment temperature varied from 100 to 600 degrees C by increments of 100 degrees C for three hours without any load. Concrete specimens were treated at each temperature level. The specimens were heated under the same condition for each temperature level. Comparison between physical and mechanical properties during heat treatment were investigated. All specimens were moist-cured for 28 days after casting. Tests were carried out on specimens cooled slowly to room temperature after heating. Results of this investigation indicated that the replacement of ordinary Portland cement by 10% silica fume by weight improved the compressive strength by about 64.6%, but replacment of ordinary portland cement by silica fume by ratios 20 and 30% improved the compressive strength by only 28% at 600 degrees C. This could be attributed to the additional tobermorite gel (CSH phase) which formed due to the reaction of silica fume with Ca(OH)(2).

ID IMPACT
AB The erosive hazard experienced by diamond during high velocity flight has been investigated. Impact with rain drops is simulated using a high-velocity jet technique (the multiple-impact jet apparatus or MIJA) which allows threshold velocities for damage to be accurately determined. This technique has been used to assess natural and synthetic diamond (both chemical vapour deposited (CVD) and high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP)), as well as CVD coatings on a range of IR-transparent substrates. The solid particle erosion hazard is assessed using a specially designed sand blasting rig which is capable of achieving velocities up to 250 m s(-1). This apparatus has been used to study natural and CVD diamond and their erosion resistance is compared with that of currently used IR window materials. The results show that the superior mechanical properties of diamond make it an ideal candidate material for IR-transparent windows in an aerospace environment.

AB Studies of mental health have indicated that the stress associated with living in hazardous areas is related, in part, to economic status, gender, kinship relationships, physical health, sociopsychological traits, community structure, and familiarity or experience with the hazard. This research modeled stress variability as manifested through expressed levels of anxiety, depression, and day-to-day function-ability in a flood-prone environment A telephone questionnaire was used to collect data from adult flood victims in a medium-size midwestern town, 3 months after the floods of 1993, as part of a comprehensive survey of how stress fluctuates overtime. Standard measures of anxiety, depression, and stress were incorporated into the survey instrument for comparison purposes. A large percentage (71%) of respondents displayed symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Traditional predictors were not significant, for stress symptoms appeared equally across gender, income, and age stratifications. The results showed that previous health conditions, particularly anxiety, employment status, and propensity to interpret the flood negatively were significant predictors for high levels of postdisaster stress.

AB Available chemical analyses have been evaluated and a water quality map prepared using electrical conductivity values. The country has been divided into three water quality regions. The quality of each region is variously a combination of climate, geology, waste disposal and irrigation practices and salt water intrusion. Region 1 has the best water quality, though in the Asmara area the groundwater is polluted by nitrate (50-150 mg l(-1) NO3). The impact on the natural environment due to the salinity hazard created by high evapotranspiration and irrigation practices becomes more pronounced across Region 2 and reaches a peak in the Red Sea catchments (Region 3), where it is supplemented by saline intrusion and mineralized upflows. In this region, soil fertility has been greatly affected and the development of groundwater has been constrained. Fluoride concentrations of 7-17 mg l(-1) are common in Regions 2 and 3 and some dental fluorosis has been noted.
   Upflows of thermal water (34-100 degrees C) exist in the Red Sea coastal zone and provide a potential energy resource. Both these and the factors affecting water resource quality in general require careful investigation and conservation measures. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Losses from natural disasters have increased in recent years due to growth of population in hazard-prone areas and inadequate enforcement of building codes. This article first examines why homeowners have not voluntarily adopted cost-effective protective measures and have limited interest in purchasing insurance. It then proposes a disaster-management program which utilizes insurance coupled with well-enforced building codes to reduce future damage. Banks and financial institutions play a key role in this program by requiring inspections of homes as a condition for a mortgage. New forms of reinsurance coverage against catastrophic losses from natural disasters are necessary to protect insurers against potential insolvency from the next mega-disaster.

AB In lowland Colias butterflies, genotypes of the enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) show major differences in molecular function, from which genotypic differences in organismal performance and fitness components in the wild are accurately predictable. The alpine species Colias meadii seems to share electromorph alleles with lowland congeners at PGI and phosphoglucomutase (PGM). However, high-resolution electrophoresis finds differences between PGI electromorphs of meadii and those of lowland taxa. Common C. meadii genotypes differ in thermal stability and are less thermally stable than similar electromorph genotypes in lowland Colias eurytheme. These meadii genotypes show heterozygote advantage in the kinetic parameters K-m and V-max/K-m (and differ sharply from genotypes of C. eurytheme). The thermally more stable homozygote is the kinetically less effective one, extending the tradeoff of kinetics vs. stability in PGI homozygotes, seen in lowland taxa, to C. meadii. Positive evidence is given for the absence of assortative mating and segregation distortion at both PGI and PGM. The functional differences among PGI genotypes explain previously observed heterozygote advantage in flight capacity and survivorship and correctly predict heterozygote advantage in male mating success, of C. meadii's PGI genotypes. Though functional information is not yet available on C. meadii PGM variants, these also show heterozygote advantage in male mating success but do not interact with PGI.
   Thus, differences in molecular function result in fitness component differences among PGI allozymes in alpine Colias, as well as in lowland ones. This is the more remarkable because the parallelism is not based on allelic identity. These results support expectations of evolutionary bioenergetics and emphasize the hazards of using ordinary electrophoresis to infer allozymes' identity among taxa. In alternative scenarios for Colias' PGI evolution-divergence from ancestral polymorphism, or independent origin-these results suggest major constraint, based in protein structure, on ability of PGI alleles to maximize fitness-related biochemical performance when homozygous.

AB Uranium secondary mineralization occurs within a series of exploratory tunnels excavated for Fe and Mn ores at Cabal Allouga, West Central Sinai. The mineralizations are associated with carbonaceous clay, siltstone and ferruginated sandstone lithologies belonging to the middle member of Um Bogma Formation, lower Carboniferous. Radiation surveys and measurements indicated the presence of high working levels (WL) at 8 stations that may present occupational working hazards in these tunnels. The WL range is between 0.61 and 2.27 with an average of 1.06 WL. Most of the stations with the highest radon-gas accumulations are located off the naturally ventilated parts of the tunnels network. It is concluded that the distribution of the Rn-gas and daughters concentrations are controlled by the natural ventilation conditions in the tunnels.

AB A population-based probability sample of elderly individuals (n = 426), who were originally studied between 1981 and 1986 (mean age at initial study was 72.5 years), were followed for mortality. Those with greater than or equal to 30 respiratory disturbances per hour of sleep had significantly shorter survival (p = 0.0034), but the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was not an independent predictor of death. When Cox proportional hazards analysis was done, only age (the strongest predictor), cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease were independent predictors of death. It may be that factors that are secondary to or associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, predispose these elderly to death.

AB Southeast Asian immigrants and refugees, in particular the Hmong people of Laos, have settled in large numbers in metropolitan areas of Minnesota. These communities, accustomed to hunting and fishing for food in Laos, now fish in some of the most contaminated waters of Minnesota. Fishing and fish-preparation customs of their homeland emphasize using all fish caught and discarding very little waste. These practices result in a potentially high exposure to PCBs and mercury. Educational outreach efforts to inform this population of the potential health hazards from consuming the fish are hindered by language and cultural barriers. While most Hmong anglers welcome information about contaminants and fishing, the typical press releases and mailings that convey fish advisory information to the public do nor reach this community. The Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources collaborated to determine the health messages and communication methods that would best meet the needs of these communities. Using the results of interviews and a behavioral survey, the Minnesota Department of Health has tailored fish consumption advisories to meet the unique needs of Southeast Asian anglers. Over the past four years, educational programs involving specialized advisories, translations, signs, a Hmong language video, and workshops have been used to inform Hmong anglers and other Southeast Asians about fish contaminants.

AB This paper summarizes information on geomorphology and physical resources as a part of the Jordan Badia Research and Development Program. The research focused on the issue of the environment in arid lands as an aid to providing practical options for sustainable development, for the benefit not only of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan but of other arid regions of the world. The research is significant in that there is a need to identify usable natural resources and establish a framework for their effective exploitation and management in a marginal, fragile environment, which is sensitive to change. Pressure for development of the Badia stems from the fact that the great majority of the population in Jordan is compressed into less than 10% of the country by environmental constraints. It is hoped that the Jordan Badia Research and Development Program will provide the required framework to ease current environmental pressures, encourage migration to the Badia, a sparsely populated region, and establish economically and ecologically self-supporting communities. This paper discusses the following areas that are related to the sustainable development of the Jordan Badia with special emphasis on the Safawi area in the northern Jordan Badia; geomorphology, including landform, processes, and hazards; geology and physical resources; hydrology; surface water and water engineering; and groundwater.

AB Objectives-The purpose of this study was to examine clinical and echocardiographic predictors of outcome in a cohort of patients with Marfan's syndrome.
   Background-Serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic root dimensions are an important clinical method for monitoring patients with Marfan's syndrome. However, there are few data on the prognostic importance of echocardiographic variables for risk stratification and timing of aortic root replacement.
   Methods-In 89 consecutive patients with Marfan's syndrome (age range 1-54 years) clinical and serial echocardiographic data (n = 62) were evaluated as potential predictors of outcome (mean (range) follow up 4 (< 1-16) years). Aortic sinus diameter and an aortic ratio normalised for age and body surface area were examined using Kaplan-Meier life table and Cox regression analysis, with the end point defined as death or surgery for ascending aortic dissection and events defined as an end point or surgery for ascending aortic aneurysm.
   Results-Overall actuarial survival at two and five years was 96% and 92% and event free survival was 85% and 76%, respectively. There were five deaths due to aortic dissection, four patients survived surgery for ascending dissection, and nine underwent root replacement with a composite graft for ascending aneurysm. Those with aortic events were older (35 (12) v 25 (13) years, P = 0.007) and had greater initial aortic root dimensions (47 (14) v 33 (8) mm, P < 0.0001) and ratios (1.6 (0.5) v 1.3 (0.2), P < 0.0001). In the 62 patients with serial echocardiographic follow up, the rate of aortic root dilatation was more rapid in those with events (15 (17) v 0 (3)%/year, P < 0.0001). Utilising a Cox proportional hazards model, the groups with an initial aortic ratio greater than or equal to 1.3 or an annual change in aortic ratio greater than or equal to 5% had a relative risk of an aortic complication of 2.7 and 4.1, respectively (95% confidence limits 1.5 to 4.8 and 1.8 to 9.3). Only one of 31 patients with an initial aortic ratio of < 1.3 and a rate of change of < 5% had an event (five year event free survival 97%).
   Conclusions-A low risk subgroup of patients with Marfan's syndrome can be identified as those with an aortic ratio < 1.3 and an annual change in aortic ratio of < 5%. These findings are helpful in optimising echocardiographic monitoring and risk stratification of patients with Marfan's syndrome.

AB The importance of the soil liquid phase (or pore water) for assessment of hazard and risk of contaminants to soil organisms has recently been recognized by several researchers. A particular concentration of contaminant in the pore water of different soils has been shown to produce similar toxicological effects. A particular content of contaminant in the soil as a whole, however, exhibits a range of toxicity in different soils. These insights raised the need for tests in which soil organisms are exposed to chemicals in natural or surrogate pore water. The present study assessed the suitability of seven species of soil invertebrate for carrying out toxicological tests for pesticides in water. Requirements were that the organisms had to survive in water, be easy to handle, be easy to bread, be sensitive to pesticides, and show unambiguous toxicological effects. The organisms tested were the nematodes Plectus parietinus and Globodera rostochiensis, the white potworms Enchytraeus buchholzi and Euchytraeus albidus, the manure worm Eisenia fetida, the mite Caloglyphus mycophagus and the springtail Folsomia candida. The springtail Folsomia candida met all the requirements and proved to be the most suitable of the organisms tested for soil quality assessment using soil pore water.

AB Risk perception may be influenced by a number of factors, such as unfamiliarity, lack of control, perceived consequences, and hazards being seen as catastrophic and having risk for future generations. Risk perception researchers have typically used such investigator-selected characteristics to assess hazards. In the first study reported here, the repertory grid method was used to elicit the terminology that subjects (n = 30) use to distinguish between 30 different chemicals. The data were submitted to generalized Procrustes analysis. The first principal axis of the resulting consensus plot separated the chemicals ranging from ''poisonous or toxic,'' ''harmful or dangerous,'' and ''sounds negative'' at one end, to ''positive effect on health,'' ''often present in food nowadays,'' and ''sounds positive'' at the other end. The second principal axis ranged from ''familiar with or knowledge of'' and ''chemical'' to ''natural.'' A second study (n = 226) was carried out to look at the general validity of the results of the repertory grid interviews using a fixed questionnaire. The data were submitted to principal components analysis and internal preference mapping. The first principal component ranged from ''safe'' and ''healthy'' at one end, to ''poisonous'' and ''harmful'' at the other end. The chemicals also separated in terms of ''familiar,'' ''chemical,'' and ''natural.'' All three methods of data collection and analysis yield essentially similar results.

AB Background and Purpose Information concerning the longterm prognosis of lacunar strokes is still limited and has shown different results. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term prognosis of first-ever lacunar strokes and the possible role of clinical prognostic factors and different pathogenic mechanisms.
   Methods Between March 1990 and November 1993, a cohort of consecutive patients presenting with first-ever lacunar infarcts was prospectively evaluated after stroke onset at day 0 to 3 and/or day 7, every 3 months up to 1 year, and every 6 months thereafter. All patients were studied according to a protocol that included demographic and clinical data, neurological examination, Toronto Stroke Scale, Barthel Index, Rankin Scale, CT scan, routine laboratory workup, electrocardiogram, carotid duplex scanning, and echocardiogram. More recently, patients have also been evaluated with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Recurrent strokes, myocardial infarction, and death were registered through direct observation, chart review, or interviews with the attending physician or family members.
   Results One hundred forty-five patients-94 (65%) with pure hemiparesis, 33 (23%) with sensorimotor stroke, 11 (8%) with ataxic hemiparesis, 5 (3%) with pure sensory stroke, and 2 (1%) with dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome-were followed for a median period of 39 months. During follow-up there were 17 deaths (3 vascular), 30 first recurrent strokes (1 fatal), and 4 myocardial infarctions. Five-year survival rate free of recurrent stroke was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% to 73%), while 5-year survival rate was 86% (95% CI, 78% to 91%). Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that age (P=.02) was the only significant predictor of survival free of recurrent stroke. Age (P<.001) and the degree of neurological dysfunction and functional disability at 7 days after the index stroke measured by the Toronto Stroke Scale (P=.05) and a Barthel Index score <40 (P=.04) were the only significant predictors of death. The 5-year probability rate of stroke-free recurrence was 72% (95% CI, 60% to 81%). Sixty-three percent of the first recurrent strokes were lacunar infarcts. When clinical, laboratory, and CT data as well as possible etiopathogenic mechanisms of lacunar strokes were considered, Cox proportional hazards analysis could not identify any predictor of stroke recurrence.
   Conclusions Our study confirms that lacunar infarcts are associated with low stroke recurrence and mortality rates. In our series, the majority of first recurrent strokes were also lacunar infarcts. Age, degree of neurological dysfunction, and functional disability at day 7 after the index stroke were significant predictors of death.

AB Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) paradigm, was used to examine androgen receptor-binding affinities of a series of structurally diverse natural, synthetic, and environmental chemicals of interest, The CoMFA/3D-QSAR model successfully illustrates that the overall steric and electrostatic properties of structurally diverse ligands for the androgen receptor are necessary and sufficient to describe the binding affinity, The practical utility of models of this type is demonstrated using parent compounds in the training set and known as well as putative biological metabolites as test set molecules. The ability of the model to accurately predict binding affinity of test set molecules suggests that structure-based 3D-QSAR models may be used to supplement the process of hazard identification, The application of 3D-QSAR models within a toxicological framework is, at present, limited by the quantity and quality of biological data for relevant biomarkers of toxicity.

AB Correlated failure time data arise frequently in scientific investigations because there exists natural or artificial clustering of study subjects such that failure times within the same cluster are correlated. It is convenient and useful to perform regression analysis by formulating the marginal distributions of the correlated failure times with the Cox proportional hazards model. In this paper, we develop a class of graphical and numerical techniques for checking the adequacy of the marginal Cox model. The proposed methods are derived from cumulative sums of martingale-based residuals over the failure time and/or covariates. The distributions of these stochastic processes under the assumed model can be approximated through simulating certain zero-mean Gaussian processes. Each observed residual pattern can then be compared objectively with a number of realisations from the approximating process. An illustration with the Diabetic Retinopathy Study is provided.

AB The Ann Arbor staging classification has long been recognised to ha ve shortcomings when used to stage the follicular lymphomas. To date, the identification of important prognostic variables has not succeeded in producing a superior staging classification that reflects the stages of dissemination of these processes in a way that can be used in the testing of new therapeutic strategies. A fresh look is taken at these factors. Data from 398 patients entered into the British National Lymphoma Investigation trials between 1974 and 1980, were analysed to evaluate the performance of the Ann Arbor staging classification. Multiple regression and proportional hazards techniques were used to determine what factors independently influence response to initial treatment, the durability of that response and ultimate survival, and to isolate factors that relate to disease progression from those that have other mechanisms of action. The Ann Arbor staging classification fared poorly, minimally separating relapse-free and cause-specific survival probabilities in patients with the largest staging groupings, III and IV. Significant prognostic heterogeneity was seen in both of these stage groupings, with 22% of patients with stage IV disease on the basis of marrow involvement having slightly better outcomes than patients with stage III disease. Significant differences in outcome were also observed between patients of different age and sex in each Ann Arbor stage grouping. Increasing number of lymph node regions involved, constitutional symptoms, the presence of splenomegaly and increasing age were observed to have powerfully independent adverse influence on probability of complete response to treatment and cause-specific survival. The evolution of the follicular lymphomas is reflected at the clinical level by an increase in the number of lymph node regions involved and splenomegaly. Simple classifications based on simple counts of lymph node regions involved and splenomegaly are more successful than the Ann Arbor staging classification in subdividing the series into patient subgroups that, regardless of gender or age, experience significantly different probabilities of responding completely to therapy and, as a consequence, relapse-free and cause-specific survival expectations. The definition of poor prognosis in subgroups may be of value in selecting patients for newer and more intensive therapeutic approaches.

TI Risk perception and victim perception: The judgment of HIV cases
SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING
LA English
DT Article
DE risk perception; victim perception; HIV AIDS
ID PSYCHOLOGY; DECISIONS
AB There is a vast literature confirming that reactions to different risks are strongly affected by characteristics other than scientific risk estimates; most of this research has concentrated on mapping people's representations of sets of widely varying dangers (e.g. diseases, natural disasters, accidents). This study explored a potentially vital component of risk that cannot be studied by eliciting general reactions to many hazards: the extent to which who is at risk contributes to perceptions and judgments of a risk. While it may be preferable to assume that misfortunes affect the population uniformly, of course the truth is not so egalitarian. Thus, for both theoretical and policy reasons, it is worth exploring psychometrically representations of a particular risk as it affects different people. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, we constructed models of respondents' representations of a disease assumed to be particularly affected by victim perception: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Subjects rated the similarity of all possible pairs among 16 scenarios involving HIV infection; the scenarios contained information about both the victim and the method of contraction. A set of attribute scales as well as political/demographic information allowed us both to interpret the structures and to predict individual differences. The results confirmed that reactions to HIV infection are greatly affected by reactions to the victim. In particular, the perceived distastefulness and riskiness of the method of infection loomed larger than did either the overall likability of the victim or the general riskiness of the victim's behavior. Further, the salience of the most statistically influential dimension, 'deservedness', depended significantly on demographic and political characteristics of the respondents, suggesting that the relationship between personal values and risk perception is in part mediated by victim perception. Implications for risk perception work and public policy are discussed.

TI Effects of uranium mining on radioactive contamination in the Kletno
   region in Poland
SO JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY-LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Lower Silesia region, in the vicinity of Kletno town (near Klodzko), there are remainders of uranium ores being mined there, such as dump sites, abandoned pits and the like. Extensive research has indicated an increase in radioactivity there. The present research was aimed at defining the radioactive contamination in the neighborhood of Kletno. The research involved gauging the radiation background, especially at the mine dumps and measuring the concentration of natural radioactive isotopes and Cs in the rocks and soil. Besides, the concentration of radium isotopes in waters was determined. Two spots only were found with higher radiation levels. A method for dealing with radiation hazards is proposed. Water analyses have indicated that flushing of radium isotopes from the rock-mass and the dumps is not significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that uranium ore mining in the region of Kletno has not caused any significant radioactive contamination.

TI Aspects of the permanent storage of uranium tailings
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Uranium tailings are generated as solid and liquid wastes in uranium mining/milling operations. Since most of the uranium deposits in the world have low grades, millions of tonnes of such wastes are produced annually. Often, the uranium tailings are locally disposed of, using sites with suitable conditions to construct tailings basins. The main concern during the operation of a disposal site is the presence of radium in the liquid phase which overflows from dewatered tailings. This barium is precipitated by adding proper chemical reagent. The potential environmental hazards of uranium tailings arise when the disposal site is abandoned after the decommissioning of the uranium mill. Huge amounts of solid waste as small particles of depleted ore remain in place. Top soils are usually for soil stabilization and for controlling radon emissions. Hence water infiltration through uranium tailings presents a potential hazard to underground aquifers. Water plays a dual role by triggering a sequence of reactions and by carrying contaminants away from the wastes sites. The situation is more serious in a country like Canada, where the precipitation rate is higher than the evaporation rate and the water table is about one metre beneath the ground surface. For permanent disposal of uranium tailings, either the hazardous constituents of these wastes have to be isolated from the percolating water, or the subsoils must have acceptable sealing and sorptive characteristics. The first approach is effected by blending proper solidifying reagents with the tailings in order to totally block them from the leaching effects of aggressive pore water. Solid waste treatment may prove costly in additive usage and the blending operation. The leaching of toxic constituents, however, becomes effective so long as the tailings are in a loose form. This is because of the acid-generating properties of the pyrite, a substantial constituent (up to 8% wt) of the tailings. Two types of contaminants tend to leave the solid and migrate to the pore water. These are the heavy metals and the radioactive elements, both of which are hazardous for their toxicity and persistence. The sorptive and neutralizing capacities of the underlying soils have to be carefully examined and measures have to be taken to stop the progression of acidic interstitial water. This paper focuses on three aspects of crucial importance to the permanent disposal of uranium tailings. These are: leaching in uranium tailings, sorption on natural geological barriers, and radium immobilization.

AB Ecosystems throughout the world have been contaminated with radionuclides by aboveground nuclear testing, nuclear reactor accidents and nuclear power generation. Radioisotopes characteristic of nuclear fission, such as Cs-137 and Sr-90, that are released into the environment can become more concentrated as they move up the food chain often becoming human health hazards. Natural environmental processes will redistribute long lived radionuclides that are released into the environment among soil, plants and wildlife. Numerous studies have shown that Cs-137 and Sr-90 are not removed from the top 0.4 meters of soil even under high rainfall, and migration rate from the top few centimeters of soil is slow. The top 0.4 meters of the soil is where plant roots actively accumulate elements. Since plants are known to take up and accumulate Cs-137 and Sr-90, removal of these radionuclides from contaminated soils by plants could provide a reliable and economical method of remediation. One approach is to use fast growing plants inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi combined with soil organic amendments to maximize the plant accumulation and removal of radionuclides from contaminated soils, followed by harvest of above-ground portion of the plants. High temperature combustion would be used to oxidize plant material concentrating Cs-137 and Sr-90 in ash for disposal. When areas of land have been contaminated with radionuclides are large, using energy intensive engineering solutions to remediate huge volumes of soil is not feasible or economical. Plants are proposed as a viable and cost effective method to remove radionuclides from the soils that have been contaminated by nuclear testing and nuclear reactor accidents.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Important structures such as nuclear power plants must have higher reliability against failure due to natural hazards than other structures. The appropriate design load level or the target reliability should be discussed in an engineering context to reach a consensus acceptable to society. Once an optimum reliability formulation is decided, the reliability is determined by a failure cost estimate. This paper proposes a normalized failure cost approach as a basis for discussion. Numerical examples are also described.

AB Recent work has extended the methods for the analysis of nested case-control studies to accommodate a broad variety of risk set sampling designs. These results have implications for the design of sampled epidemiologic cohort studies. We describe a model which is a natural extension of the Cox proportional hazards model and may be used to estimate parameters from sampled risk set data. We illustrate how these techniques may be used to solve three diverse design and analysis problems from epidemiologic research.

TI Competition in a spatially heterogeneous environment: Modelling the risk
   of spread of a genetically engineered population
SO THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANISMS
AB In recent years regulations have been developed to address the risks of releasing genetically engineered organisms into the natural environment. These risks are generally considered to be proportional to the exposure multiplied by the hazard. Exposure is, in part, determined by the spatial spread of the organisms, a component of risk suited to mathematical analysis. In this paper we examine a mathematical model describing the spread of organisms introduced into a hetereogeneous environment, focusing on the risk of spread and plausibility of containment strategies. Two competing populations are assumed, one the natural species and the other an engineered species or strain, both of which move randomly in a spatially heterogenous environment consisting of alternating Favourable and unfavourable patches. The classical Lotka-Volterra competition model with diffusion is used. Analyses of the possible spread and invasion of engineered organisms are thus reduced to finding periodic travelling wave solutions to the model equations. We focus on whether a very small number of engineered organisms can spatially invade a natural population. Initially we investigate the problem for spatially periodic diffusion coefficients and demonstrate that, under the right circumstances and a large enough unfavourable patch, invasion does not succeed. However, if spatially periodic carrying capacities are assumed along with spatially varying diffusion rates, the situation is far more complex. In this case containment of the engineered species is no longer only a simple function of the unfavourable parch length. BS using perturbation solutions to the nonuniform steady states. approximate invasion conditions are obtained. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB The combined effect bar of a large-scale fire followed by small-scale herbivory by porcupines and bast scales were studied on the recruitment of Aleppo pines (Pinus halepensis). A massive fire on Mount Carmel, Israel, in 1989 destroyed 300 ha of a natural pine forest. Although Aleppo pine is tire-adapted, its resilience after fire is jeopardized by other biotic and abiotic hazards. Herbivory by porcupine and scale was responsible for the loss of approximately 6.5% of the saplings at four years post-fire. Porcupine damage was patchy but rather heavy (mean = 15% mortality of pine saplings with a maxium value of 21% mortality) in plots with low vegetation cover and high rock cover while only marginal impact was observed in relatively dense vegetation (mean mortality = 0.5%). Similarly, scale damage was widespread patchy (with maximum of 37% sapling mortality), and not correlated with vegetation cover. While porcupine activity merged only in the fourth year after the lire, scales infested saplings over a wide range of ages. Porcupine activity was local and distributed over relatively small areas while scale infestation was widespread and general. This study demonstrated that post-tire pine saplings in harsh condition patches (shallow dry soil, high rock cover) are more exposed to the combined damaging effect of porcupine and scales than sapling in patches with more suitable environmental conditions.

AB A large proportion of global natural rubber production takes place in Southeast Asia. The majority of this rubber is produced by smallholders. Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia are the three principal countries involved. In Malaysia and Indonesia the smallholder sector accounts for 72% and 84% of total rubber production respectively. In other countries rubber plays a significant role on a more local basis. Imperata is a serious problem for the smallholder rubber farmer in most of Southeast Asia in three respects: the high cost (labour and/or capital) of opening Imperata-infested land, its competitive effect on rubber and annual intercrops, and the fire hazard that it poses during the dry season as a major source of combustible material. The costs of Imperata to smallholders are substantial in terms of a direct loss through fire and revenue foregone or delayed as a result of competition. Most smallholders intercrop their rubber during the first 1-3 years after planting it, and during this period Imperata is reasonably well controlled. Intercropping is only feasible for a limited period because of limited soil fertility and/or the shading effect of the rubber trees, After intercropping, Imperata tends to establish itself for a few years until it too is shaded out by the rubber. This is the problem period, during which farmers practise only limited weed management, if any.
   A large amount of research has been done on methods of controlling Imperata, but the recommended methods have been generally spurned by smallholders unless they have been given subsidies to apply them. This paper describes the precise nature of the Imperata problem, with reference to some of the smallholder rubber-based farming systems within Southeast Asia; the different Imperata control strategies currently practised in these farming systems; and some of the constraints on the adoption of currently and recently recommended practices. It then proposes a ten-point agenda for research on Imperata control, including two ways in which current research programmes could be usefully reoriented: first, they need to take greater account of smallholder farming systems and constraints; and second they should shift their emphasis from single-method to integrated control systems.

TI Volatile hydrocarbon exposure during in situ burning of crude oil at sea

AB Personal exposure of response workers (a nd other personnel) to volatile hydrocarbons a nd benzene was monitored as part of the Newfoundland Offshore Burn Experiment (NOBE), a major oil spill combustion trial organized by Environment Canada and sponsored by over 25 governmental and private organizations from Canada and the United States. Benzene and total petroleum hydrocarbons were monitored using organic vapor monitors and charcoal tubes and analyzed by gas chromatography. Benzene and total petroleum hydrocarbon exposures were generally very low during experiments involving in situ burning (the controlled combustion of oil on water); over 95% of the determinations were below the analytical limit of detection, which was usually less than 0.1 ppm. in situ burning of unweathered crude oil al an accidental oil spill would probably be associated with higher exposure to benzene and other volatile hydrocarbons than at NOBE if the crude (1) had a higher natural benzene content than the Alberta Sweet Mixed Blend used at NOBE, (2) was less weathered than the oil in this study, or (3) had a larger evaporating crude surface area. Under the conditions of this experiment, the in situ burning process itself did not appear to present a significant benzene exposure risk to spill response personnel. Although these results suggest that the in situ burning process itself does not appear to present a significant benzene exposure risk to spill response person nei, the hazards of each accidental spill scene (regard less of spill countermeasures employed) must be evaluated and understood to assure worker safety.

TI Airways responsiveness, wheeze onset, and recurrent asthma episodes in

AB To describe the role of airways responsiveness in predicting incidence of wheeze in early adolescence and to examine the association between airways responsiveness and active asthma symptoms, children who had been tested for airways hyperresponsiveness were assessed prospectively. Of 770 children in the East Boston Childhood Respiratory Disease Cohort who were between 5 and 9 yr of age at time of entry into the study, 281 children received airways challenges during voluntary follow-up conducted between 1980 and 1986. Each subject presented a sequence of wheeze or asthma diagnosis reports along with a sequence of time-varying covariates, including airways challenge results and symptom and exposure information. A robust ''pooled repeated observations'' analog of the proportional hazard regression model was used to assess associations among risk factors and the probability of incident wheeze or active asthma. In the analysis of wheeze incidence, airways responsiveness (elicited via eucapnic hyperventilation with cold air or methacholine challenge) among those free of a history of wheeze at a given visit was found to be associated with a greater tendency to develop wheezing in the next visit (odds ratio [OR] = 3.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21, 12.66), after controlling for a constellation of known risk factors. In the analysis of recurrent asthma episodes, airways responsiveness at a given visit was associated with a greater tendency to have an asthma diagnosis reported at the subsequent visit (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.92, 9.23). For subjects presenting multiple airways responsiveness challenge studies, two successive positive airways responsiveness results were independently associated with a higher likelihood of recurrent asthma episodes. These results confirm the predictive importance of airways responsiveness in the natural history of the development and persistence of asthmatic symptoms.

AB The present analysis was stimulated by previous findings on the possible influence of natural ultralow-frequency (ULF; 0.001-10 Hz) geomagnetic field variations on the cardiovascular system and indications of an effect of man-made ULF magnetic fields on the rate of myocardial infarction. In the present study, we considered the occupational health hazards of the strongest ULF magnetic fields in densely populated urban areas. Measurements of ULF magnetic field fluctuations produced by trains powered by DC electricity were performed by means of a computer-based, highly sensitive, three-component magnetometer. We found that the magnitude of magnetic field pulses inside the driver's cab of electric locomotives (ELs) could be greater than or equal to 280 mu T in the horizontal component perpendicular to the rails and up to approximately 130 mu T in the vertical component, and, in the driver's compartment of electric motor unit (EMU) trains, they were approximately 50 and 35 mu T, respectively. We have investigated the relationships between the occupational exposure to ULF magnetic field fluctuations produced by electric trains and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among railroad workers in the former Soviet Union. We have analyzed medical statistical data for a period of 3 years for approximately 45,000 railroad workers and 4,000 engine drivers. We have also analyzed 3 years of morbidity data for three subgroups of engine drivers (similar to 4,000 in each group) operating different types of trains. We find that EL drivers have a twofold increase in risk (2.00 +/- 0.27) of coronary heart diseases (CHDs) compared with EMU drivers. Because our analysis of major CVDs shows that the examined subpopulations of drivers can be considered to have had equal exposure to all known risk factors, the elevated CHD risk among EL drivers could be attributed to the increased occupational exposure to ULF magnetic fields.

High mountains are specific areas within a moderate climatic belt where we study activity of several sets of morphodynamic processes with different influence on ecosystem evolution. The documented data describe not only present-day dynamics of a high mountain landscape, but above all, they indicate the necessity to carry out the stationary observations, especially in coherence with determinations of limits and natural hazards, within the research projects dealing with landscape ecology.

AB In an earlier work [White PA et al. (1996): Environ Mot Mutagen 27:116-139] we examined the genotoxicity of dichloromethane extracts from a variety of industrial effluent samples. In this companion work, we used the SOS Chromotest to investigate the sorption of the extracted genotoxins to effluent suspended particulate matter. The affinity of the genotoxins for particulate matter is expressed as a genotoxicity sorption partition coefficient (K-d-genotox. The results indicate that industries known for their emission of combustion by-products, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, often have high K-d-genotox values (greater than or equal to 10(6)). These include metal refining and founding industries as well metal surface treatment facilities. In contrast, K-d-genotox values for pulp and paper mills and sewage treatment facilities ore several orders of magnitude lower (less than or equal to 10(4)). In Several cases the calculated K-d-genotox values ore in agreement with the K-ow values of genotoxic substances isolated from genotoxic industrial waste samples studied by other researchers. The sorption partition coefficient, in conjunction with the concentration of available particulate matter, was used to determine the percent of organic genotoxins adsorbed to effluent suspended particulate matter. Values range from 2.3% to 99.8%. High values (>70%) were obtained for metal surface treatment and inorganic and organic chemical production facilities. Low values (<30%) were obtained for sewage treatment facilities and pulp and paper mills. The results also demonstrate the effect of variations in the concentration of available particulate matter on the genotoxicity of both aqueous and particulate extracts. The results suggest that the sorptive properties of the particulate matter itself are reduced when the concentration of particulate matter is very high (> 1,000 mg per I). The use of sorption partition information in inferring the physical-chemical nature of the putative genotoxins and the implications of the results for assessing the hazard posed to aquatic biota by industrial genotoxins ore discussed.

TI Fitting the exponential and logistic surplus yield models with mortality
   data: Some explorations and new perspectives
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE modelling-production; natural mortality estimation; hake; risk-averse
   management
AB The paper explores the feasibility of different methods of fitting the logistic production model of Csirke and Caddy (1983) using data from two hake stocks: New England silver hake, and (separately for males and females) Peruvian hake. Using the natural mortality estimate generated by the logistic, the theory of production modelling with estimates of total mortality rate (Z) is extended to include the exponential model of Fox (1970). Linear and non-linear approaches were also used to fit the exponential model. The paper concludes that directly fitting the quadratic form of the logistic as advocated by Csirke and Caddy (1983) should be abandoned in favour of formulating an abundance index Y-i/(Z(i)-M), and fitting it linearly against (Z(i)-M). The bootstrap technique for fitting the models was very useful in estimating parameter variance, as well as in generating empirical distributions for population and management parameters such as r, M, Z(MSY), MSY, which showed clear maxima with this approach: those for M appear to be of the correct order of magnitude. Since these distributions are largely asymmetrical, the percentile approach to providing confidence intervals was followed. For bootstrapping with the examples chosen, this avoided problems with negative roots, a hazard of the direct fitting procedure, A simple approach to formulation of risk-averse management strategies was explored using the percentiles of a cumulative distribution of MSY estimates from bootstrapping against total mortality rate, which it is suggested, would allow fishery management advice to be generated based on annual mortality and yield vectors alone.

AB The content of uranium, thorium, radium, lead, polonium, and plutonium in bottom sediments and algae from two locations at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast have been determined. Some parent:progeny ratios for evaluation of the geochemical behavior of the nuclides have been estimated as well. The extractable and total uranium and thorium are determined by two separate radiochemical procedures to differentiate the more soluble chemical forms of the elements and to estimate the potential hazard for the biosphere and for humans. No distinct seasonal variation as well as no significant change in total and extractable uranium (also for Ra-226) content is observed. The same is valid for extractable thorium while the total thorium content in the first two seasons is slightly higher.
   Our data show that Po-210 content is accumulated more in the sediments than Pb-210, and the evaluated disequilibria suggest that the two radionuclides belong to more recent sediment layers deposited in the slime samples compared to the silt ones for the different seasons.
   The obtained values for plutonium are in the lower limits of the data cited in literature, which is quite clear as there are no plutonium discharge facilities at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.
   The obtained values for the activity ratio Pu-238:Pu-239+240 are higher for Bjala sediments compared to those of Kaliakra. The ratio values are out of the variation range for the global contamination with weapon tests fallout plutonium which is probably due to Chernobyl accident contribution.
   The dependence of natural radionuclide content on the sediment type as well as the variation of nuclide accumulation for two types of algae in two sampling locations for five consecutive seasons is evaluated. No serious contamination with natural radionuclides in the algae is observed.

AB In developing countries, agriculture is being intensified to produce more food and agricultural products. In most agricultural development strategies, the order of priorities is on: (i) increasing yields, (ii) crop protection, and (iii) human health, environmental and social aspects. This sequential rather than integrated approach contributes to many problems related to sustainability in agriculture. Examples of increased problems with soil erosion, secondary salinization and waterlogging, soil nutrient depletion, increased pest problems, public health hazards and environmental pollution illustrate this phenomenon. To improve the present situation, agricultural development strategies should be based on an integration of factors determining the agricultural production potential of a particular zone: the biophysical environment, the land reclamation level, and external input use. Integrated Crop Management and systems analyses can help to put these factors in the best perspective, and to set the priorities for agricultural research and development accordingly. Techniques aimed at sustainability are listed, and their use is discussed in areas with different production potentials. To assess the impact of cropping techniques on the sustainability of agricultural production systems, suggestions are made for the monitoring of selected physical, chemical and biotic characteristics of agro-ecosystems.

AB The behavior of Pb in the A and B horizons of an Alfisol from Michigan and an Ultisol from Virginia was studied to determine the effects of ''shock'' loading. Combined sequential extraction-sorption isotherm analysis (CSSA), a relatively new and little tested method, was used in the study. After spiking to simulate severe contamination (similar to 3000 to 60,000 mg/kg), CSSA revealed unexpectedly high levels of exchangeable Pb in the A horizon of the Alfisol and in both horizons of the Ultisol, and showed that the sorption capacities of the phases commonly responsible for fixation of Pb at low to moderate levels of contamination were exceeded. Carbonate sorbed the bulk of the Pb in the Alfisol B horizon and has a high sorption capacity in both soils, despite the presence of other phases with a strong affinity for Pb. Thus, when shock loading occurs (e.g., at a shooting range or dump sites), the highly contaminated A horizons of both soils are expected to pose a serious toxic hazard to humans, and groundwater contamination is possible in association with the Ultisol. CSSA proved useful for determining the sorption capacities of the individual phases while together in a natural soil system and therefore is a valuable method for predicting the attenuation capabilities of soils.

AB The objective of the study was to determine the natural durability of Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus camaldulensis grown in Ethiopia in comparison with the reference species Fagus sylvatica and an additional species Pinus sylvestris, using field and laboratory tests. An additional objective was to determine a durability factor (DF-value) calculated from the impact strength or MOE losses of exposed test stakes. The factor DF was used to compare the resistance against wood-decaying agents of examined species in relation to that of the reference species after short exposure in ground contact. Four test fields, two in Ethiopia and two in Sweden, were used.
   The evaluation of the test stakes in the field and test blocks in the laboratory showed that the heartwood of E. camaldulensis was the most resistant and F. sylvatica the least resistant to wood-decaying agents. In the laboratory tests heartwood blocks of E. globulus and P. sylvestris showed a similar degree of deterioration by the attack of brown rot. White rot attack was more serious in the hardwood test blocks, except for heartwood blocks from E. camaldulensis, than in P. sylvestris. The differences between the tested species with respect to degree of deterioration in the four test fields can be partly explained by the variations in decay type and decay hazard.
   The durability ranking based on impact strength or stiffness tests of the tested species was similar to that based on visual evaluation and mass losses obtained in field and laboratory tests.

AB The condition of untreated heartwood specimens after more than 25 years' exposure in an Australian field test of in-ground durability is discussed. Median specimen life (MEDSL) values are provided at all five sites for 42 of the 77 timbers in test. Overall, decay contributed more to specimens becoming unserviceable than did termites. While six timber species have not given MEDSL values at either of the two sites with greatest decay hazards, only two have not given such values at either of the two sites with greatest termite hazards. Only Eucalyptus wandoo was common to both listings. Mean ratings are provided for any timber not having yielded a MEDSL, with such ratings showing that Sequoia sempervirens was in the best condition at the driest site. Sapwood of Pinus radiata treated to 12 kg/m(3) with CCA was performing better than heartwood of any of the naturally durable species at each of the five sites.

AB Guatemala is one of the Central American countries thar for some years now have been participating in a regional program for natural hazard assessment and disaster reduction, funded by the Nordic countries and coordinated by a regional institution (CEPREDENAC*). Recent work related to seismic hazard has included the standardization, reporting and processing of seismicity data across the borders, followed by regional hazard modeling. The work presented here for Guatemala City represents a step from a regional to a more local level, based on reevaluation of historical seismicity, geological data related to active faults, and attenuation relations recently derived from analysis of strong motion records from the region. The site specific hazard calculations indicate that expected values of peak ground acceleration are ranging from less than 2 to more than 6 m s(-2), corresponding to annual exceedence probabilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.001, respectively.

AB A three-parameter family of survival models is introduced. The base-line density is derived and the main properties of the model, including a frailty interpretation, are discussed. Several different regression models are considered, and one of these, which is non-proportional hazards and which has other interesting properties-the generalized time-dependent logistic model-is developed in some detail. The method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate the parameters and to generate the observed information in the presence of right censoring. Zn a reduced form the family is characterized by a hazard function given explicitly by the time-dependent multiple-logistic function. Consequently the natural logarithm of the 'conditional odds on instantaneous failure' is a linear function of time. This model is shown to describe, closely, the survival pattern of 855 incident cases of lung cancer studied in Northern Ireland. The data are analysed in relation to sex and age at diagnosis and the results are compared with those obtained by using the proportional hazards model of Cox

AB A few years ago reports appeared in European media concerning alleged health hazards with clothing. Textile finishers, textile producers and related associations as well as research and testing institutes took this as a good opportunity for a new market segment and created so-called eco-textiles. They are specially labeled as toxicologically tested. Aside from trademarks of single companies; e.g., eco line, green cotton, natural line etc., the most important standards in Europe are Oko-Tex Standard 100 and M.S.T. According to the requirements the goods are controlled for pH, some fastness properties, formaldehyde, carcinogenic dyes, dyes that can break down into carcinogenic arylamines or can cause allergic reactions to the skin, extractable harmful heavy metals, halogenated carriers or contaminations with pentachlorophenol and pesticides.
   The requirements of labelling and if they can be met with normal raw materials (fibers, dyestuffs and chemicals) or if a special selection must be made are reviewed. The experience with textiles to be tested for labeling shows that most of the problems arise in the field of heavy metal complex dyes which could be extracted from the fabrics by perspiration or saliva solutions. It can not be shown that in all cases dyeings with metal complex dyes in heavy shades meet the requirements, so a special selection is sometimes advisable. Models and recent developments for an environmentally friendly production are also reviewed.

This paper examines the risk to human health from consumption of drug residues in animal-derived foods. In particular, it focuses on antimicrobial residues and residues of natural and synthetic hormones used to enhance the growth of livestock. In addition, it discusses the issue of bacterial resistance and the effects on human health from the use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock.

ID EQUIVALENT LINEARIZATION; RANDOM VIBRATION; SYSTEMS
AB The basic requirements needed for response analysis of wood structures against natural hazards are reviewed. A method for stochastic dynamic analysis of wood structures, which allows investigations into their performance and safety under natural hazards such as earthquakes and severe winds, is presented. To illustrate the method, earthquake ground motions are modeled as a stochastic process with Gaussian white noise properties. A single-degree-of-freedom wood structural system is modeled by a hysteretic constitutive law that produces a smoothly varying hysteresis. It models previously observed behavior of wood joints and structural systems, namely, (1) nonlinear, inelastic behavior, (2) stiffness degradation, (3) strength degradation, and (4) pinching. The constitutive law takes into account the experimentally observed dependence of wood joints' response to the input and response at an earlier time (known as memory). Hysteresis shapes produced by the proposed model compare favorably with common wood joints. The hysteresis model can produce a wide variety of hysteresis shapes, degradations, and pinching behavior to model a whole gamut of possible combinations of materials and joint configurations in wood construction. The nonstationary response statistics of a single-degree-of-freedom wood building subjected to white noise excitations are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic equivalent linearization. The latter is shown to give a reasonably accurate prediction of the system's response statistics, which may be used in calculating design response values. The method of analysis is general and may be used to study the response of various kinds of structural systems, including multi-degree-of-freedom systems, as long as appropriate structural models are available and appropriate hysteresis model parameters for these systems are known.

TI SURVIVAL ANALYSIS OF 2 CONTROLLED TRIALS OF RIFABUTIN PROPHYLAXIS

AB Objectives: Rifabutin prophylaxis has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteremia in two randomized controlled clinical trials, but a survival benefit has not been observed. An analysis of complete follow-up of these patients through August 1992 was performed to assess subsequent survival, because although follow-up in the previous trials was limited at the time of initial analysis, the analysis did suggest that a survival benefit might be emerging.
   Methods: Data from 1146 AIDS patients with CD4+ counts less than or equal to 200x10(6)/l enrolled at 73 US and Canadian sites in two clinical trials of MAC prophylaxis were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis with rifabutin use modeled as a time-dependent covariate, taking into account the initial randomized double-blind phase of the trials and the subsequent open-label phase of follow-up of those patients. Survival from date of enrollment was analyzed. Other covariates adjusted for in the analysis were CD4+ lymphocyte count, Karnofsky performance score and hospitalization for opportunistic complications of AIDS.
   Results: Patients who received open-label rifabutin may have had a better prognosis than those who did not, based on Karnofsky score and occurrence of opportunistic disease. Adjusting for these variables and for use of rifabutin as time-dependent covariates, the relative hazard (RH) of dying while receiving rifabutin prophylaxis was 0.74 for the entire cohort [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60-0.91; P<0.004]. For patients with an enrollment CD4+ count less than or equal to 50x10(6)/l (n = 655), the RH was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58-0.98), and for patients with an enrollment CD4+ count of >50x10(6)/l (n = 491), the RH was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.49-0.99).
   Conclusions: An analysis of the combined double-blind and open-label follow-up of two clinical trials of rifabutin prophylaxis for MAC supports the suggestion of the double-blind study that rifabutin improves survival of AIDS patients.

AB Objectives: To estimate survival trends for persons with haemophilia and HIV/AIDS.
   Design and methods: Survival analysis conducted among the cohort of HIV-positive haemophiliacs with AIDS at the Italian Haemophilia Registry. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival times, stratifying for demographic and clinical covariates. Cox proportional hazards model was applied in order to identify factors independently associated with survival.
   Results: Median survival from the first AIDS diagnosis to death was estimated to be 17.0 months for 176 individuals with AIDS. Median survival after AIDS diagnosis increased from 12.0 months in December 1983-December 1988 to 17.0 months in January 1989-May 1990 and to 25.0 months in lune 1990-December 1991. Median survival times were significantly (P<0.001) lower for individuals diagnosed with non-infective AIDS indicator diseases (lymphoma, AIDS-associated neurological disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, wasting syndrome: 4.0 months), in comparison with haemophiliacs diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP; 18.0 months) or other infections (35.0 months). Antiretroviral treatment after AIDS diagnosis was associated with a longer survival than that estimated for individuals with no treatment after AIDS; the same was true for PCP prophylaxis. Younger age at HIV seroconversion and at AIDS diagnosis were associated with a longer survival. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with survival were type of AIDS indicator disease and antiretroviral administration after AIDS diagnosis.
   Conclusions: This study indicates an increasing survival from AIDS diagnosis to death over time, also as a result of the introduction of antiretroviral therapy. Survival trends are similar to those reported among homosexual men and intravenous drug users with AIDS, suggesting a similar access to the health-care system for individuals with AIDS. Survival studies may improve our understanding of the natural history of HIV infection and may indicate the impact of preventive measures.

AB To evaluate the impact of older age (>50 years old) on survival in late-stage human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, the authors analyzed 846 HIV-infected patients at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 1987 to 1992. The median age was 42 years with 171 (20.2%) subjects aged 50 or more years. Survival was measured from the date of initial lymphocyte testing (median CD4 count, 223 cells/mm(3)) until death or censoring. Compared with those aged less than 40 years, and after multivariate proportional hazards adjustment for other significant determinants of survival (CD4 percentage, CD8 count, hematocrit, and prior acquired immunodeficiency syndrome diagnosis), there was no difference in survival for those aged 40-49 years, but there was a trend toward decreased survival in those aged 50-59 years (relative hazard = 1.32, 95% confidence interval 0.90-1.94) and in those aged 60 or more years (relative hazard = 1.56, 95% confidence interval 0.99-2.46). The impact of older age on mortality in HIV disease is, however, less than the impact of age on overall mortality in the United States. Accordingly, while older HIV-infected patients do have a somewhat poorer survival, this risk need not be too highly emphasized in individual patients; older patients deserve aggressive management.

AB The specific radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were measured in samples of different types of bricks (clay, cement, and sand) fabricated and used in urban buildings in the Cairo region in Egypt, using a gamma-ray spectrometer with a HpGe-detector. The radiation hazard of the total natural radioactivity in the studied brick was estimated by different approaches. The concentrations of the natural radionuclides and the radium-equivalent activity in the studied Egyptian brick samples are compared with the corresponding results for bricks of the different countries and are found to be significantly lower in all cases.

AB The General Social Survey 1990 of Canada gathered information on home-leaving of respondents and of their children (adopted, step, or natural). This study examines the effects of gender, family structure, and culture on the timing of children's home-leaving. Ail children aged 15 and over are selected for the analysis presented in this paper. The proportional hazards model is applied to the data, after taking extra effort in identifying as many covariates as possible at the time of the event (home-leaving of children). Respondents' marital status assumes special significance not only among family structure variables but also among all the predictor variables. For example, the two categories ''cohabiting parent'' and ''widowed parent'' have the largest (absolute) estimates for the models considered. The study also supports the hypothesis that stepchildren leave home earlier than children who live with natural parents. Similarly, parental nativity or ethnicity (signifying cultural differences) is also shown to be a very important predictor. The study also documents important gender and cohort differences.

AB Could users of climate information for impact assessment be overlooking an important source of information in climate indicators? We argue that indexes of leading climate indicators of impacts may be usable knowledge for consumers and may provide guidance to the global climate observing community concerning the types of data and information that users need. Five classes of indexes are suggested: Climate Extremes Index (CEI) and Greenhouse Climate Response Index (GCRI) - such are already available from scientists at the U.S. National Climatic Data Center plus proposed indexes of Hazard Warning, Ecosystem Health, and Energy Demand and Renewable Natural Resources. We conclude that the CEI and GCRI possess several necessary attributes to become usable knowledge; the other indexes have the potential to become usable knowledge, but remain to be implemented with climate data and fully evaluated.

AB An area of a Tertiary and Cretaceous deposits, 100-310 m above sea level and on predominant 20-45 degrees, highly dissected, concave slopes was investigated to assess its geotechnical characteristics and land use planning implications. Lithologies include turbidites, fluvial conglomerates, breccias, sandstones, mudrocks, carbonates, granodiorite, acid dykes, chloritized and epidotized volcanics, andesite and Holocene fluvial deposits. Bedrock is highly fractured and sheared, hydrothermally altered and highly weathered. Soils are quite variable, with a strong geological control on soil properties. Soils are generally sandy to gravely, with local silts and clays in mudrocks, within Holocene alluvium or in hydrothermally altered and sheared granodiorites. The soils are composed of 0.14-80.00% gravel; 5.36-62.50% sand, 2.33-50.55% silt, 0.17-51.50% clay, and total fine content between 2.50 and 94.50%, with natural moisture between 4 and 44% during the dry season, plastic limit between 6 and 35%, liquid limit between 19 and 83% and plasticity index between 1 and 59%. Sandy soils have residual friction angles between 19 and 39 degrees, PI values less than 35% with cohesion between 1.00 and 5.27 KN/m(2) for cohesive samples. ASTM classification of soils include soil groups GC, GM, GW, GP, SP, SM, SC, SM, SC, ML, CL and CH.
   Based on the characteristics of the terrain, the geotechnical and land use planning problems include high landslide frequency and susceptibility, soil erosion, fluvial and reservoir sedimentation, high debris flow hazard, cut slope failures, potentially expansive clays and silts, seepage erosion and soil piping, differential settlement in interlayered competent and incompetent lithologies, high solution erosion and potential subsidence over limestones, waste water disposal problems and groundwater pollution and seismic induced settlement and ground failures. These phenomena suggest that systematic site investigations should be conducted prior to the utilization of these areas for construction and development in order to minimize the deleterious effects resulting from ground failure.

AB The purpose of this report is to describe the research programs and program activities of the US Department of Energy (DOE) that most directly relate to topics in the field of environmental geology. In this light, the mission of the DOE and the definition of environmental geology will be discussed. In a broad sense, environmental geology is that branch of earth science that emphasizes the entire spectrum of human interactions with the physical environment that include environmental health, mineral exploration and exploitation, waste management, energy use and conservation, global change, environmental law, natural and man-made hazard assessment, and land-use planning. A large number of research, development, and demonstration programs are under DOE's administration and guidance that directly or indirectly relate to topics in environmental geology. The primary mission of the DOE is to contribute to the welfare of the nation by providing the scientific foundation, technology, policy, and institutional leadership necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy sources, a more productive and competitive economy, improved environmental quality, and a secure national defense. The research and development funding effort has most recently been redirected toward greater utilization of clean fossil fuels, especially natural gas, weatherization, renewable energy, energy efficiency, fusion energy, and high-energy physics. This paper will summarize the role that environmental geology has played and will continue to play in the execution of DOE's mission and the energy options that DOE has investigated closely. The specific options are those that center around energy choices, such as alternative-fueled transportation, building technologies, energy-efficient lighting, and clean energy.

TI Radionuclides in the Great Lakes basin
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
DE dose; fallout; Great Lakes; nuclear power; radioactivity; risk
ID MORTALITY; URANIUM
AB The Great Lakes basin id of radiologic interest due to the large population within its boundaries that may be exposed to various sources of ionizing radiation. Specific radionuclides of interest in the basin arising from natural and artificial sources include H-3, C-14, Sr-90, I-129, I-131, Cs-137, Rn-222, Ra-226, U-235, U-238, Pu-239, and Am-241. The greatest contribution to total radiation exposure is the natural background radiation that provides an average dose of about 2.6 mSv/year to all basin residents. Global fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted before 1963 has resulted in the largest input of anthropogenic radioactivity into the lakes. Of increasing importance is the radionuclide input from the various components of the nuclear fuel cycle. Although the dose from these activities is currently very low, it is expected to increase if there is continued growth of the nuclear industry. In spite of strict regulations on design and operation of nuclear power facilities, the potential exists for a serious accident as a result of the large inventories of radionuclides contained in the reactor cores; however, these risks are several orders of magnitude less than the risks from other natural and man-made hazards. An area of major priority over the next few decades will be the management of the substantial amounts of radioactive waste generated by nuclear fuel cycle activities. Based on derived risk coefficients, the theoretical incidence of fatal and weighted nonfatal cancers and hereditary defects in the basin's population, attributable to 50 years of exposure to natural background radiation, is conservatively estimated to be of the order of 3.4 x 10(5) cases. The total number of attributable health effects to the year 2050 from fallout radionuclides in the Great Lakes basin is of the order of 5.0 x 10(3). In contrast, estimates of attributable health effects from 50 years of exposure to current nuclear fuel cycle effluent in the basin are of the order of 2 x 10(2). Although these are hypothetical risks, they show that the radiologic impact of man-made sources is very small compared to the effects of normal background radiation.

TI A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING GENETIC VULNERABILITY
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Genetic risk assessment is a tool for describing and communicating genetic risks and hazards of natural resource management objectively, on a case-by-case basis, to reduce conflicts and ambiguities that arise from generalized perceptions of such risks. Here, we describe a general framework and some technical approaches to quantifying genetic risks and hazards. We develop a model of genetic vulnerability of managed populations that links sources of potential technological hazards, protective mechanisms and responses, and potential losses using artificial propagation of Pacific salmon in the Columbia River as an example. Unlike other models of ecological risk assessment that emphasize containment of hazards, risk assessment must consider both the protective measures against genetic hazards (reliability) and the potential rate of recovery fi om failure of protective measures (resilience). We illustrate the essential components of these safeguards, and we illustrate how genetic vulnerability can be described by inventorying, measuring, or rating safeguards and by applying genetic or ecological models to describe losses.

TI Modelling the effects of various parameters on the growth of Listeria
   monocytogenes on liver pate
SO FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB To more fully assess the health hazard posed by Listeria monocytogenes in liver pate products, multi-factorial design experiments were conducted to examine the influence of temperature (4 and 10 degrees C), NaCl (1 and 3%), sodium nitrite (0 and 200 ppm), sodium erythrobate (0 and 550 ppm) and spice (0 and 0.4%), on the growth of the organism on experimental pate. A total of 16 different liver pate formulations made experimentally were stored at 4 and 10 degrees C for various periods of time. Analysis of variance was used to determine the effect of the various factors on maximum growth rate. L. monocytogenes was able to grow well, with temperature being the only factor exerting an effect on the growth rate. After transforming by natural logarithms, analysis of variance of the lag phase gave a more complicated model, but with temperature again being the only factor demonstrating a main effect. Comparisons of the experimental data were made against the modelling data from the US Department of Agriculture's Pathogen Modelling Program (PMP). Mean experimental growth rate was significantly lower than the mean predicted value. Mean experimental lag-phase time was slightly, but not significantly, longer than the mean predicted value. Some formulations gave rise to lag-phase times shorter than those predicted by the PMP, a situation which could be hazardous. Additional comparisons done with pate modelling data produced by researchers in New Zealand also showed some discrepancies. Thus, it may not be possible to accurately predict the growth of pathogens on individual foods when using one model. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

AB Environmental geological and geophysical studies of the submarine portions of the Fraser delta at Vancouver reveal complex patterns of sedimentation, erosion and slope instability resulting from natural and industrial activity. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of these processes is needed to help identify sea-floor hazards in areas of significant economic importance, and to monitor environmental contamination and changes to the physical environment due to industrial activity. Portions of the delta slope adjacent to the main fluvial distributary are prone to downslope mass movement in response to sediment loading, accentuated by the development of steep subaqueous slopes and interstitial (biogenic) gas. The presence of Canada's largest coal export facility, ferry terminals, and submarine high-voltage cables in close proximity to areas of mass movement are causes for concern. Triggering events for other large slope failure complexes (several tens of square kilometres in areal extent) include large earthquakes.

AB To assess the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) on the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a longitudinal study was conducted among 416 HIV-positive, AIDS-free persons infected through injecting drug use or homosexual or heterosexual activity and with known seroconversion dates. End points were diagnosis of AIDS and a CD4 cell count of <100 x 10(6) cells/L. HCV antibodies were detected in 214 persons (51.4%), The crude relative hazard (RH) of progression to AIDS was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.76) for HCV-coinfected participants compared with those not coinfected. After adjustment for CD4 cell count, the RH was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.52-1.79). Similar RHs were found using a CD4 cell count of <100 x 10(6) cells/L as the end point. The median CD4 cell loss was 4.83 x 10(6) cells/L per month among coinfected persons and 5.70 x 10(6) cells/L per month among the others. These results suggest that coinfection with HCV does not influence clinical and immunologic progression of HIV disease.

AB The process of ecological risk assessment should involve the ability to predict adverse outcomes of particular environmental contaminants or human intrusions. Ecological risk assessment generally focuses on populations, communities, and ecosystems, rather than on individual health. We explore the importance of life history strategies of aquatic turtles to their risk from environmental contaminants and other human activities using three examples: the wood turtle Clemmys insculpta, a freshwater species; the diamondback terrapin Malaclemys terrapin, a littoral species; and marine turtles as a group. These turtles are partly herbivorous and are at low or intermediate levels on the food chain, yet are particularly vulnerable due to their life history strategies of being long-lived with relatively low survival of young. They suffer a variety of natural mortality factors that include predation, starvation, and disease, as well as inundation and destruction of nesting beaches and their eggs by storms. Yet they also face a number of anthropogenic hazards, including toxic chemicals and floatables (plastics); capture for food, other products, and pets; incidental mortality in fishing gear; disturbance while nesting or moving on land; injuries or death by collision with boats; and increased predator exposure because of humans. The three turtle species (or groups of species) examined have experienced these natural and anthropogenic pressures differentially, with resultant differences in the rates of population declines. Because they are lower on the food chain than other obligate carnivores, they are less vulnerable to toxics, and to date, toxics seem a relatively inconsequential environmental risk to turtles.

AB Peroxisome proliferators are a diverse group of rodent hepatocarcinogens that include hypolipidemic drugs, plasticizers and herbicides. These compounds when administered to rats and mice produce a dramatic increase in the size and number of hepatic peroxisomes and increase the capacity of the hepatocyte to metabolise fatty acids by inducing peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes such as acyl CoA oxidase. Members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors have been identified that can be activated by peroxisome proliferators and are therefore called 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptors' (PPAR). There appear to be four PPAR isoforms within vertebrates termed alpha, beta, gamma and delta and the alpha isoform appears to be the one that is most strongly activated by synthetic peroxisome proliferators such as Wy-14,643. It has been demonstrated that PPAR alpha forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and binds to specific DNA sequences located upstream of peroxisome proliferator responsive genes. It is therefore suggested that PPARs mediate the pleiotropic effects of peroxisome proliferators including the regulation of gene expression and rodent hepatocarcinogenesis. Rodents fed a high-fat diet develop peroxisome proliferation and many of the enzymes induced by peroxisome proliferators are involved in fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, PPARs are activated by a wide range of fatty acids and hypolipidemic drugs, such as clofibrate, that lower triglyceride levels in man. Although it remains to be determined whether fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators bind directly to any PPAR these data suggest that the natural role of PPARs in man is to regulate lipid homeostasis. Interestingly, hypolipidaemic drugs fail to elicit peroxisome proliferation in human hepatocytes although hypolipidaemic effects are observed in patients. A further understanding of the role of PPAR in man will require: (1) the identification of additional human PPARs combined with functional analyses using these and other nuclear receptors that can antagonise PPAR action; (2) a comparison of the expression of these different receptors in human tissues; (3) a clearer understanding of how peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids activate PPAR; and (4) sequence analysis of the regulatory regions in the human counterparts of rodent peroxisome proliferator responsive genes. Together, these data will provide an important mechanism-based framework to assess the hazard of peroxisome proliferators to humans.

AB Currently, there is a highly politicized debate on the comparative risks of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals. Since humans are often exposed to complex mixtures of both classes of chemicals, the real-world value of this debate is unclear. However, in any such comparison, it is important to realize that some naturally occurring substances - such as lead or tobacco - have been so altered or disturbed by human activity that they are best considered as products of human activity, or anthropogenic. Reasons for concern over synthetic and anthropogenic chemicals include: persistence and propensity for long-term storage in biota and the environment; structural similarity to endogenous biomolecules; and additivity to natural hazards.

AB Objective: To determine the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing ischemic events in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
   Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
   Setting: University-affiliate hospitals.
   Patients: 372 neurologically asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of 50% or more in at least one artery as determined by luminal diameter reduction on duplex ultrasonography.
   Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned to receive either enteric coated aspirin, 325 mg/d, or identically appearing placebo. Duration of therapy was 2.0 years for the aspirin recipients and 1.9 years for the placebo recipients.
   Outcome Measures: Patients were scheduled for a clinical examination every 6 months for assessment of the occurrence of any clinical event in the composite end point, which consisted of transient ischemic attack, stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or death.
   Results: At baseline, the 188 patients receiving aspirin and the 184 patients receiving placebo had similar demographic, ultrasonographic, and laboratory characteristics. The median duration of follow-up was 2.3 years. The annual rate of all ischemic events and death from any cause was 12.3% for the placebo group and 11.0% for the aspirin group (P = 0.61). The Cox proportional hazards analysis yielded an adjusted hazard ratio (aspirin-placebo) of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.46; P = 0.95). The annual rates for vascular events only were 11% for the placebo group and 10.7% for the aspirin group (P = 0.99). The multivariate analysis yielded a hazard ratio of 1.08 (CI, 0.72 to 1.62; P = 0.71).
   Conclusion: Aspirin did not have a significant longterm protective effect in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 50%) carotid stenosis.

AB A large class or major environmental risks are subject to severe moral hazard problems. The purpose of this paper is to study the potential conflicts between cost minimization and safety care. The intuition is that regulatory efforts or sheer competition inducing a greater focus on cost minimization may tilt the agents' trade-off towards taking too much risk. Here we study the problem in the context of regulation of a natural monopoly and see how high powered incentives may conflict with safety care. We address the issue of moral hazard in environmental risk with adverse selection, limited liability, risk aversion and multiprincipals.

LA English
DT Article
DE CLIMATIC CHANGE; SEA SURGE; ADRIATIC SEA; DOCUMENTARY SOURCES
AB Hundreds of documents containing data about the climate of the past, collected in public libraries and archives of Northern Italy, have been gathered and analyzed. All the descriptions of the sea surges that have occurred in Venice from AD 787 till the beginning of the modern instrumental records have been here reported and critically commented. This data set is very useful in improving our knowledge about the Mediterranean climate and natural hazards, especially with reference to the protection of Venice. In evaluating the reliability of the data, the historical approach has been applied to verify the sources and the descriptions they give, following rigorous criteria and methodologies. The majority of the data allows a qualitative evaluation of the height reached by the sea level; some of them a quantitative one. The level was expressed in old local styles, and has been transformed into the modern metric unit. A very interesting document dated 1867 reports the height of the surge above both the mark of the average high-tide level and the steps of St. Mark's Square, so that now it is possible to determine the subsidence that has occurred since that date, i.e., 34cm, in accordance with other findings.

TI PROBABILISTIC SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS AND DESIGN EARTHQUAKES - CLOSING
   THE LOOP
SO BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is conducted because there is a perceived earthquake threat: active seismic sources in the region may produce a moderate-to-large earthquake. The analysis considers a multitude of earthquake occurrences and ground motions, and produces an integrated description of seismic hazard representing all events. For design, analysis, retrofit, or other seismic risk decisions a single ''design earthquake'' is often desired wherein the earthquake threat is characterized by a single magnitude, distance, and perhaps other parameters. This allows additional characteristics of the ground shaking to be modeled, such as duration, nonstationarity of motion, and critical pulses. This study describes a method wherein a design earthquake can be obtained that accurately represents the uniform hazard spectrum from a PSHA. There are two key steps in the derivation. First, the contribution to hazard by magnitude M, distance R, and epsilon must be maintained separately for each attenuation equation used in the analysis. Here, epsilon is the number of standard deviations that the target ground motion is above or below the median predicted motion for that equation. Second, the hazard for two natural frequencies (herein taken to be 10 and 1 Hz) must be examined by seismic source to see if one source dominates the hazard at both frequencies. This allows us to determine whether it is reasonable to represent the hazard with a single design earthquake, and if so to select the most-likely combination of M, R, and epsilon (herein called the ''beta earthquake'') to accurately replicate the uniform hazard spectrum. This closes the loop between the original perception of the earthquake threat, the consideration of all possible seismic events that might contribute to that threat, and the representation of the threat with a single (or few) set of parameters for design or analysis.

TI LAND-USE PLANNING REFORM IN ONTARIO - IMPLICATIONS FOR GREAT-LAKES
   SHORELINE MANAGEMENT
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE GREAT LAKES; HAZARDS; LAND USE; ONTARIO; SHORELINE
AB Recent planning reform in Ontario has focused on an interest in ecosystem based land-use planning and management and will have significant impacts on the provincial Great Lakes shoreline management program. Since the high water levels on the Great Lakes during 1985/86, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and local conservation authorities (CAs) have been developing provincial policy and management plans to reduce property damage from flooding and erosion that occurs during frequent high-water-level events. The program reflects the long-standing interest in use of municipal land-use zoning regulations to control shoreline development in areas prone to flooding and erosion. Provincial land-use planning reform underway since 1991 will have important implications by requiring a greater focus on land-use and environmental issues. Important lessons can be learned from the experience in Ontario with regard to coastal one management in other regions where land-use planning can be greater linked to environmental protection and conservation.

AB For 4 yr, we studied the host-pathogen relationship of the microsporidium Thelohania solenopsae Knell, Allen, and Hazard within field populations of the black imported fire ant, Solenopsis richteri Forel, in Argentina. We established and monitored 6 field plots having a high density of fire ant colonies, many infected with the microsporidium. The density of colonies, initially 162 colonies per hectare, decreased to 28 colonies per hectare. The percentage of infected colonies, initially 22.4%, increased to 35.7% and was negatively associated with the density of colonies but positively associated with rainfall. T. solenopsae was the only known natural enemy of fire ants present consistently and in high levels within the plots. We suspect it is one of the main factors responsible for decreases in S. richteri population densities.

AB Clinically, portal hypertension has been considered to be less common and less severe in patients with cirrhosis resulting from iron overload in homozygotes for genetic hemochromatosis than in patients with cirrhosis of other causes. To characterize the prevalence and progression of portal hypertension in genetic hemochromatosis (GH), 120 cirrhosis and iron-overloaded patients were compared with a control group of 120 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis (PNC) who were matched for gender, age, Child's class, and alcohol abuse. Gastroesophageal endoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography were performed at diagnosis and repeated every 12 months and every 6 months, respectively, to evaluate the presence and severity of varices, the caliber of the portal vein and its collaterals, and splenic size. At diagnosis a similar frequency of varices was observed in patients with GH (25%) and in PNC (24%), as well as of portal vein abnormalities and spleen enlargement. During the follow-up period, all but two of the patients with GH were treated by phlebotomy and depleted of excess iron. After a mean of 6 +/- 4.3 (SD) years of observations (range, 2 to 10 years), varices were improved or completely reversed in 26% of patients with cirrhosis and GH but in only 5% of those with PNC (P < .01). Bleeding from varices was observed in only one patient with GH but in five patients with PNC, Of 22 patients with GH in whom portal hypertension was unmodified or worsened, 16 had coexistent hepatic viral infection, The hazard risk for the development of de novo (i.e., a new occurrence) varices was 17 times higher in patients with PNC than in patients with GH (P < .001). The natural history of portal hypertension in patients with GH was substantially improved by phlebotomy therapy except in the presence of a coexistent hepatic viral infection, These results emphasize the need for intensive phlebotomy therapy even in patients diagnosed after the development of cirrhosis.

AB Human civilizations are threatened by natural hazards and by risks connected to technological progress in civil, chemical and nuclear engineering. The notion of acceptable risk forms the basis for the design of many engineering structures ranging from simple river levees to nuclear reactors, that contribute to human welfare. A frame work is developed to judge the acceptability of risks from an individual and a societal point of view.

AB Rationale: the natural history and risk factors for hip osteoarthritis are still unknown, Objective: to identify factors predicting a need for total hip replacement at some time during the course of hip osteoarthritis. Patients and methods: outpatients evaluated between 1981 and 1986 for hip osteoarthritis were studied retrospectively. The date of diagnosis and the characteristics of the patients and hip disease at diagnosis were recorded, The risk of eventual total hip replacement was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the value of each variable for predicting total hip replacement, Results: we included 149 patients (50 males), The risk of total hip replacement was estimated at 36 +/- 4% five years after diagnosis, Factors with significant effects in the multivariate analysis were age older than 54 years at diagnosis (relative risk 3;15), body mass index greater than 27 (relative risk 2.97), and severe radiological joint space narrowing at diagnosis (relative risk 2.26), Conclusion: this study confirmed the often severe course of hip osteoarthritis and identified several factors possibly associated with rapid progression.

AB The rate at which immunodeficiency develops in untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected persons might be increasing or decreasing over time because of viral evolution or other factors. Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1 seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+ percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988. In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte count of <500 cells/mm(3) was not associated with the secular time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.13). The authors' data do not suggest a major change in the natural history of HIV-1 infection in this population.

TI A MORTALITY KINETICS APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZING THE FRACTIONATED

AB The utility of mortality kinetics analysis in evaluating mortality data from fractionated exposure studies was demonstrated using radon-progeny induced extra mortality as an example. Gompertz (log-hazard) functions were used to characterize the mortality of male SPF Wistar rats exposed to radon progeny at 100 WL and 1000 WL for total exposures ranging from 20 to 10 240 WLM. There was an upward parallel displacement of the Gompertz functions following the period of radon exposure. The shape of the Gompertz functions for the exposed animals was consistent with a Gompertz model of toxicity resulting from short-term exposure, resulting in non-repaired injury that summates with natural (aging) injury. The parallel upward displacements (epsilon(ss)) of the Gompertz functions showed an unexpected non-monotonic pattern for rats exposed at 1000 WL. The parallel upward displacements showed a sharp upward increase from 320 to 640 WLM, fell at 1280 WLM, and thereafter increased linearly to 10 240 WLM. These data suggest that the radon progeny exposure-mortality response is non-linear. In contrast, there was no significant parallel upward displacement of the Gompertz functions for rats exposed at 100 WL for total exposures of 20-1280 WLM, but a large displacement began at 2560 WLM total exposure.

AB Objective: To study the prevalence, incidence and predictive value for progression to AIDS of the HIV-1 syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype in HIV-infected injecting drug users (IDU) compared with HIV-infected homosexual men.
   Design: Two prospective cohort studies on HIV-1 infection among IDU and homosexual men.
   Methods: HIV-infected IDU (n=225) and homosexual men (n=366) without AIDS were studied from March 1989 through December 1993. Data on laboratory markers, including the presence of SI variants, demographics, behavioural characteristics and clinical events were collected at every visit.
   Results: At baseline, SI variants were detected in 4% of IDU and 17% of homosexual men. During the study period 18 IDU and 68 homosexual men switched from non-SI to SI phenotype (4-year cumulative incidence, 14.6 and 28.4%, respectively) before AIDS diagnosis. Among participants with a documented date of HIV infection the cumulative incidence of SI was lower among IDU than homosexual men (4-year cumulative incidence, 6.2 and 20.7%, respectively). At AIDS diagnosis, 21% of all AIDS cases among IDU had the SI phenotype compared with 54% among homosexual men. In both risk groups an accelerated CD4 decline was found after the non-SI-to-SI switch. The SI phenotype appeared to be a predictor of AIDS (multivariate relative hazard, 5.33), independent of CD4 cell count and p24 antigen at baseline. In the multivariate time-dependent analysis, the relative hazard of SI phenotype decreased considerably, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of SI phenotype on progression to AIDS is mediated by CD4 cell count.
   Conclusion: The SI phenotype is associated with accelerated CD4 decline and progression to AIDS in both risk groups. The remarkable lower prevalence and incidence of the SI phenotype among IDU may implicate a difference in pathogenesis and natural history of HIV infection linked to transmission group.

TI CLIMATIC HAZARDS WARNING PROCESS IN BANGLADESH - EXPERIENCE OF, AND
   LESSONS FROM, THE 1991 APRIL CYCLONE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article

AB Science and technology cannot control entirely the causes of natural hazards. However, by using multifaceted programs to modify the physical and human use systems, the potential losses from disasters can effectively be minimized. Predicting, identifying, monitoring, and forecasting extreme meteorological events are the preliminary actions towards mitigating the cyclone-loss potential of coastal inhabitants, but without the successful dissemination of forecasts and relevant information, and without appropriate responses by the potential victims, the loss potential would probably remain the same.
   This study examines the process through which warning of the impending disastrous cyclone of April 1991 was received by the local communities and disseminated throughout the coastal regions of Bangladesh. It is found that identification of the threatening condition due to atmospheric disturbance, monitoring of the hazard event, and dissemination of the cyclone warning were each very successful. However, due to a number of socioeconomic and cognitive factors, the reactions and responses of coastal inhabitants to the warning were in general passive, resulting in a colossal loss, both at the individual and national level. The study recommends that the hazard mitigation policies should be integrated with national economic development plans and programs. Specifically, it is suggested that, in order to attain its goals, the cyclone warning system should regard the aspects of human response to warnings as a constituent pari and accommodate human dimensions in its operational design.

AB The diversity and abundance of protozoa and fungi infecting colonies of the fire ants Solenopsis richteri Forel and S. quinquecuspis Forel were sun eyed in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. A total of 185 roadside sites was selected, and 1,836 colonies were sampled and examined under phase-contrast microscopy. Pathogens were found at 32% of the sites and in 10% of the colonies. The microsporidium Thelohania solenopsae Knell, Allen & Hazard was the most common microorganism; it was present at 25% of the sites and 8% of the colonies. In some sites within the surveyed region, the percentage of infected colonies with T. solenopsae ranged from 40 to 80%. Other pathogens present were the microsporidium Vairimorpha invictae Jouvenaz & Ellis and the fungus Myrmecomyces annellisae Jouvenaz & Kimbrough. A field site was selected for future ecological studies.

AB Vegetation patterns and dendrochronology were used to study landforms and processes in three unique geographic areas. Specifically, we report on geobotanical associations related to forest fires, slope failures, rivers, and glaciers. The work was conducted in the Niobrara valley of the Great Plains of Nebraska, Tensleep Canyon of the Bighorn Mountains, Yellowstone-Teton fire areas of the Snake River drainage in Wyoming, and the Nanga Parbat and Batura areas of the western Himalaya. Results indicate that geobotanical associations can be used to provide additional information to study landforms, natural hazards, and sediment yields. In addition, geobotany can be used to detect processes responsible for environmental change. Remote sensing technology can play an important role in detecting vegetation distributions and green biomass variations.

AB To examine potential confounders and dose-response data for the association between smoking and menopause, we used both a cross-sectional and case-controlled approach. In total, 10 606 middle-aged women residing in eastern Massachusetts were surveyed about their age at menopause and smoking history; 344 women (cases) with natural menopause prior to age 47 and 344 age-matched women (controls) who were still menstruating or who had a menopause after age 46 were selected for further study. Risk for menopause was assessed by Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards, or logistic regression models. From cross-sectional data on 8657 women aged 45-54, the hazards odds ratio for a natural menopause among women who ever smoked compared to non-smokers was 1.31 (95% C.L. 1.21-1.42) and among women who had accumulated 30 or more pack-years was 1.87 (95% C.L. 1.67-2.04) after adjustment for parity and weight, An additional potential confounder from the case-controlled study was lower educational attainment, and after adjustment for this variable, significant trends persisted for risk of early menopause associated with age began smoking (P = 0.03), years of smoking (P = 0.01) and pack-years of smoking (P = 0.03). This study demonstrates an association between smoking and early menopause in both cross-sectional and case-controlled data that is not confounded by parity, weight, socio-economic status, or nutritional variables.

AB Background: The management of small melanocytic choroidal tumors is controversial. An important reason for this controversy is that the natural course and metastatic potential of these lesions are not defined clearly. Prior studies that have attempted to elucidate the natural course of these lesions have focused on selected small groups of patients with presumed small choroidal melanomas. There are no large studies investigating the growth potential and metastatic potential for the spectrum of small melanocytic choroidal tumors when considered as an unselected whole group. In addition, the clinical features of these tumors predictive of metastases have not yet been identified.
   Methods: A retrospective review was performed on 1329 patients with small melanocytic choroidal tumors measuring 3 mm or less in thickness. Clinical parameters of the patient and tumor were obtained and analyzed for their relation to eventual tumor growth and metastasis using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   Results: Tumor growth was documented in 18% of patients. The factors predictive of tumor growth (multivariate analysis) included greater tumor thickness (P = 0.0001), posterior tumor margin touching optic disc (P = 0.0001), symptoms of flashes, floaters (P = 0.002), and blurred vision (P = 0.003) relative to no symptoms, orange pigment on the tumor surface (P = 0.004), and the presence of subretinal fluid (P = 0.05). The relative risk (RR) was greatest for initial tumor thickness 2.1 to 3.0 mm (RR = 5.2) and tumor thickness 1.1 to 2.0 mm (RR = 4.3) relative to tumors 1 mm or less in thickness, as well as posterior margin touching the optic disc (RR = 2.6). After adjusting for significant tumor variables, the effect of interventional tumor treatment showed a decreasing risk for tumor growth compared with continued observation without treatment. Of 1329 patients, metastases developed in 35 (3%). The factors predictive of metastases (multivariate analysis) included posterior tumor margin touching the optic disc (P = 0.003), documented growth (P = 0.003), and greater tumor thickness (P = 0.004). The relative risk for metastases was greatest for tumor thickness 1.1 to 3.0 mm (RR = 8.8) and growth (RR = 3.2).
   Conclusion: Of small choroidal melanocytic tumors measuring 3 mm or less in thickness at the time of initial examination, 18% demonstrated growth and 3% metastasized during the period of follow-up. Based on this analysis, the clinical features of these tumors can be used to estimate the risk for tumor growth and metastases and assist the clinician with patient management.

DE CLIMATE CHANGE; ALLUVIAL SOILS; IRRIGATION; SENEGAL
AB As a result of climatological hazards in the 1970s much of the traditional rainfed cropping in the Sahel has been abandoned or shifted to irrigation schemes. In this paper attention is focused on the factors that affect selection and development of such irrigation parameters in the Senegal River valley, and on the impact they have on optimizing cropping patterns and water use. The impact of natural resources and local socio-economic conditions on project conception and field lay-out is illustrated, and subsequent management solutions for overcoming some site-specific soil and climatic problems are discussed.

AB Using a transplant approach, we studied the response of the submerged macrophyte, Isoetes lacustris L., to natural alterations of subsurface irradiance. In 1992, potted Isoetes plants were systematically moved along a 1-6 m range of water depths and their performance compared with that of stationary plants during 1992-1993.
   We found that the Isoetes plants, subject to low levels of daily insolation, declined rapidly. Massive shoot deaths occurred within 2 months under the insufficient irradiance regimes which prevailed beyond 3 m depth at median water level. Hazard rates correlated to low insolation according to a Weibull probability law, and the hazards rose sharply below a daily insolation of approximately 2 mol m(-2). Low temperature caused lower hazard rates. Plants exposed to adversely low irradiance for 1 month partly recovered when brought to more favourable depths, but elevated mortality was present afterwards even for plants subsequently experiencing shallow-water irradiance. Damage was detectable for more than 1 year following exposure to low light conditions. The population dynamics of this perennial species evidently reflect critical short-term incidents of the past, making it difficult to interpret ecological relationships based only on the present-day situation.

AB The immune system is composed of cells collectively best known as leukocytes. They are derived from bone marrow and are widely distributed throughout the body, which they defend against infections and certain tumors. Immune cells may also react to relatively innocuous foreign substances or against ''self'' components resulting in allergic or autoimmune disease, respectively. There is evidence that various chemicals can act as either immunosuppressants, allergens, or inducers of autoimmunity. A number of immune function tests have been developed to identify chemicals with immunosuppressive potential. However, immune suppression only poses a hazard in the presence of infectious agents or tumor cells. Temporal relationships between exposure to a compound and exposure to these agents have an impact on the risk associated with immune suppression. Three examples from animal research are presented to illustrate how temporal factors may affect the risk of infection: (1) effects of immunosuppressants on natural killer cell activity and susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus infection; (2) effects of phosgene on alveolar macrophage phagocytic function and susceptibility to Streptococcus zooepidemicus infection in mice and rats; and (3) effects of ultraviolet radiation on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and susceptibility to Leishmania major and mycobacterial infections.

TI ILLUMINATION AND OBSERVATION GEOMETRY FOR NOAA-AVHRR IMAGES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB It is very important to consider the illumination and observation geometry when satellite data are processed, i.e. to take into account all the angles in the radiation path. The importance of modifications introduced in the radiation and the geometric distortions of the image depends on the range of values of the angles. The angles related to the illumination geometry depend on the Sun's position relative to the sensor and the pixel being observed, while those related to the observation geometry depend on the radiometer characteristics. NOAA satellites carry the AVHRR sensor with an observation angle of +/- 56 degrees and their scanning line is approximately 2800 km wide. For these satellites, the angular values involved in the illumination and observation geometry show an important gradient along the scanning line. The purpose of the present paper is to analyse in detail both the illumination and observation geometry. The results of such analysis were applied as an example using raw data of the NOAA-11-AVHRR images over the Rio de In Plata and its ocean front region. As a part of the analysis and to improve the visual interpretation of the results, one-band synthetic images of the different illumination parameters were obtained. The results show that the large sensor field of view reduces the availability of the swath in after a few hundred kilometers. On the other hand, high latitudes should be excluded from the analysis, especially at winter solstice because of the large values of solar zenith angles. Different types of sporadic natural events that happened in the southern region of South America are also discussed, considering the results of the analysis and the purpose of enhancing the usefulness of AVHRR data in monitoring hazards. The phenomena considered were fires, volcano eruptions, and red tide blooms.

AB To evaluate the association between acyclovir use and survival in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection, observational data from 1044 persons with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and less than or equal to 250 CD4 cells/mm(3) following initiation of zidovudine were analyzed, Of these patients, 336 (32%) received regular acyclovir (greater than or equal to 6 weeks in 2 months). There were no differences in mortality data between acyclovir users and nonusers overall or when analyzed from 1 year after first use of zidovudine, from time of AIDS in those with ARC at enrollment, from patients with AIDS or <100 CD4 cells/mm(3) at enrollment, or from patients taking acyclovir for up to 10 months. Acyclovir use was associated with increased mortality (relative hazard, 1.28; P = .057) independent of herpesvirus infections and of other characteristics associated with mortality, In this study, the use of acyclovir at doses for treatment of herpes simplex virus infection in combination with zidovudine was not associated with prolonged survival.

AB To determine the pattern of exercise and associated adverse events, including injuries, a mail survey was conducted on participants in the 1980 Peachtree Road Race Study for whom we were able to obtain current addresses. A total of 535 persons responded, 326 men and 209 women, representing 72% of those with identifiable addresses. Although only 56% of respondents reported that they were still running in 1990, 81% reported that they were still exercising regularly. The cumulative probability for continuing to run was 0.71 for men and 0.56 for women. Injury (31%) was the chief reason given by men for stopping permanently. For women, 28% stopped because they chose another form of exercise. Fifty-three percent of respondents had at least one injury during the 10-yr interval. The probability of experiencing an injury was associated with higher weekly mileage. The knee was the most frequently injured site. Thirty-nine percent of women and 35% of men reported being verbally assaulted. Approximately 10% of persons were hit by thrown objects or bitten by a dog. In a group of recreational runners, almost half had stopped running 10 yr later, but over 80% were still physically active. Many runners sustain injuries or suffer hazards related to their exercise.

AB The control of objectionable growth of algae blooms in animal water troughs, open storage water tanks, water cisterns, reservoirs and others is a permanent problem especially in tropical and subtropical countries.
   The algae may under certain conditions adversely effect the quality of water. Decomposition produces, including toxic cellular material and other substances, are released into water during cellular lysis which may be present in sufficient concentration to render the water a hazard to human and animal health when used for drinking. The present experimental study was carried out in order to investigate the extent of effciency of electrochemical treatment of scored water with copper- and zinc-electrodes as a method for water purification from the algae Chlorella vulgaris.
   The laboratory treatment resulted in complete destruction of the algae within 18-19 hours, using a constant current of approximately 30 mA. In addition a practical experiment was carried out with blooming algae in a storage tank of 50 m(3). Algae were killed within 5 days.

AB Background: Few epidemiologic studies are available that quantify the magnitude of the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin associated with sun exposure and related factors such as skin type, In addition, several studies have found an association between cigarette smoking and SCC, Purpose: We prospectively examined the risk of developing SCC in relation to phenotype and the effects of sun exposure, as well as to cigarette smoking and other factors, during 8 years of follow-up in a cohort of 107 900 predominantly white women aged 30-55 years at base line in 1976, Methods: Questionnaires regarding medical history and health-related variables were sent to Nurses' Health Study participants every 2 years, beginning in 1976, Information on constitutional factors (natural hair color, childhood and adolescent tendency to sunburn and tan, and lifetime number of severe sunburns), lifestyle factors (regular time spent outdoors in the summer and sunscreen use), the state lived in at birth and at ages 15 and 30 years, and cigarette smoking habits were ascertained by questionnaire, A total of 197 women with first-incident, histologically confirmed, invasive SCCs that were diagnosed from 1982 to 1990 were included in this analysis, Multivariate analysis using proportional hazards models was used to calculate the relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with adjustment for confounders, Results: The risk of SCC was increased in women living in California (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.3-2.6) and Florida (RR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1-3.9) at base line, compared with those living in the northeastern states, This risk was higher for women living in those states at birth and at 15 years of age (RR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.4-4.4 for California and RR = 3.0; 95% CI = 0.7-1.2 for Florida), Red (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.7) and light brown (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.4) hair colors were associated with an increased risk of SCC, compared with dark brown hair, After adjusting for the number of sunburns, women who tended to burn after 2 or more hours of sun exposure as children had a slightly higher risk of SCC than those who never burned (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.9-2.5 for burn and RR = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.6-2.0 for painful burn), although the actual number of severe burns appeared to be a more important factor (RR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5-4.0 for six or more burns), Finally, current cigarette smokers showed a 50% increase in the risk of SCC compared with never smokers (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1), Conclusion: Exposure to the sun leading to sunburn, particularly at early ages, should be avoided to decrease the risk of incident SCC.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The original Whickham Survey documented the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a randomly selected sample of 2779 adults which matched the population of Great Britain in age, sex and social class. The aim of the twenty-year follow-up survey was to determine the incidence and natural history of thyroid disease in this cohort.
   DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS Subjects were traced at follow-up via the Electoral Register, General Practice registers, Gateshead Family Health Services Authority register and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Eight hundred end twenty-five subjects (30% of the sample) had died and, in addition to death certificates, two-thirds had information from either hospital/General Practitioner notes or post-mortem reports to document morbidity prior to death. Of the 1877 known survivors, 96% participated in the follow-up study and 91% were tested for clinical, biochemical and immunological evidence of thyroid dysfunction.
   RESULTS Outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality were determined for over 97% of the original sample. The mean incidence (with 95% confidence intervals) of spontaneous hypothyroidism in women was 3.5/1000 survivors/year (2.8-4 5) rising to 4.1/1000 survivors/year (3.3-5.0) for all causes of hypothyroidism and in men was 0.6/1000 survivors/year (0.3-1.2). The mean incidence of hyperthyroidism in women was 0.8/1000 survivors/year (0.5-1.4) and was negligible in men. Similar incidence rates were calculated for the deceased subjects. An estimate of the probability of the development of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism at a particular time, i.e. the hazard rate, showed an increase with age in hypothyroidism but no age relation in hyperthyroidism.
   The frequency of goitre decreased with age with 10% of women and 2% of men having a goitre at follow-up, as compared to 23% and 5% in the same subjects respectively at the first survey. The presence of a goitre at either survey was not associated with any clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. In women, an association was found between the development of a goitre and thyroid-antibody status at follow-up, but not initially.
   The risk of having developed hypothyroidism at follow-up was examined with respect to risk factors identified at first survey. The odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) of developing hypothyroidism with (a) raised serum TSH alone were 8 (3-20) for women and 44 (19-104) for men; (b) positive anti-thyroid antibodies alone were 8 (5-15) for women and 25 (10-63) for men; (c) both raised serum TSH and positive anti-thyroid antibodies were 38 (22-65) for women and 173 (81-370) far men. A legit model indicated that increasing values of serum TSH above 2mU/l at first survey increased the probability of developing hypothyroidism which was further increased in the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies. Neither a positive family history of any form of thyroid disease nor parity of women at first survey was associated with increased risk of developing hypothyroidism. Pasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels at first survey when corrected for age showed no association with the development of hypothyroidism in women.
   CONCLUSIONS This historical cohort study has provided incidence data for thyroid disease over a twenty-year period for a representative cross-sectional sample of the population, and has allowed the determination of the Importance of prognostic risk factors for thyroid disease identified twenty years earlier.

TI SELF-RESEEDING PASTURE BARLEY FOR MEDITERRANEAN DRYLANDS
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID GRAIN; SYRIA
AB Permanent pastures were successfully established with mixtures of bulks of crosses of Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare with ssp. spontaneum (given the name Mia Milia) and with mixtures of natural crosses involving H. vulgare ssp. agriocrithon (given the name Akhera). These crosses were made to exploit the brittle rachis gene of wild barley in order to develop self-reseeding pasture barley. No re-seeding of the pasture was necessary but a light cultivation to cover the seed in the first year of solving improved plant establishment. No cultivation was necessary in the following years. Genotypes with a tough rachis were rapidly eliminated from the Milia pastures (F-2 bulks) because of their poor seed dispersal. Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer increased dry matter yield. Levels of seed dormancy in the wild barley were adequate to provide a safeguard against extreme dry weather conditions and other natural hazards. Forage quality was very high, with a crude protein content of 18% and digestible organic matter of 80% in harvested dry matter. Permanent barley pastures that exploit the brittle-rachis gene of indigenous genetic material have considerable potential for increasing the animal-carrying capacity of permanent pastures and marginal cropped lands.

TI UNDERSTANDING WINDTHROW - SILVICULTURAL IMPLICATIONS
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE WINDTHROW; UPROOTING; BLOWDOWN; WIND
AB Windthrow is a damaging agent that can be of paramount importance in silviculture. Windthrow depends on a number of factors interacting with each other. This paper tries to incorporate windthrow concerns into the silvicultural decision making process by understanding the windthrow process and its interaction with silviculture. The forces involved in the windthrow process are reviewed. The effects of natural factors on these forces are examined and the potential impact of silviculture on these factors is discussed. Some available hazard rating systems are reviewed, trying to underline their applicability in the Eastern Canadian context. Climate affects the severity and frequency of storms. However, wind speed in a particular stand is influenced strongly by local topography. Soil and root characteristics determine the sturdiness of the anchoring system. Many stand-related factors, such as stand height, age, density and stem form, can also exert an influence on the resistance to uprooting. Silviculture can modify the vulnerability to windthrow by acting on these factors. in stands at risk stripcutting, thinning or the creation of new margins can cause important losses. The impact of stem form also indicates the need for an early control of stand density. Among the hazard rating systems available, the British system seems the most complete but would require some adjustments for use in the Eastern Canadian context.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic significance of estimating tumor cell proliferation in stage I cervical squamous carcinoma by analyzing MIB 1 immunostaining with respect to the lesion size, lymphatic spread, and clinical outcome. A possible relationship between MIB 1 index and natural killer activity was also discussed. The medical records of 34 patients with stage I squamous cervical carcinoma who had undergone primary radical surgery at the Institute of Gynecologic and Obstetrics, Ancona University, between 1988 and 1993, were recruited from our series of 57 consecutive cases and reviewed. Thirty-one patients were considered eligible for the study and evaluated for age, demographic characteristics, tumor histologic grade, tumor size, lymphatic spread, and adjuvant radiotherapy. The expression of primary tumor proliferation related to Ki67 antigen was immunohistochemically evaluated by monoclonal IMB 1 antibody (Immunotech, Marseille Cedex, France) on microwave oven-processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. The basal natural killer cell activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes was evaluated against K562 cell line and expressed in lytic units for each patient. The MIB 1 immunostaining was significantly related with tumor size (P = 0.001) and lymphatic spread (P = 0.009); in contrast, there was no relationship between grade of histologic differentiation and MIB 1 immunostaining. The Cox proportional hazards analysis showed a significant independent relationship between MIB 1 immunostaining and disease-free survival (P = 0.004). The analysis of natural cytotoxicity defined a significant inverse relationship between peripheral blood lymphocyte's natural killer activity and tumor MIB 1 immunostaining (r = -0.07, with P = 0.03). Our data defined the prognostic significance of tumor cell proliferation immunostaining, an interesting parameter correlated with the disease-free survival in locally advanced cervical carcinoma. The relationship between MIB 1 index and natural killer activity is interesting; natural cytotoxicity seems to be altered in the host with respect to the cervical carcinoma characteristics.

TI CONTOURS OF DEVELOPMENT
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING

   ENTREPRENEURIAL; TECHNOLOGIES; MODEL; ADOLESCENCE; PERFORMANCE;
   EVOLUTION
AB New ventures seem to suffer more difficulties and business failures than do established firms. Also, there is a pattern to the mortality, with most newly founded businesses lasting only a few years.
   Explanations of high failure rates in new ventures have often centered on ''poor management,'' or have postulated that firms chose inappropriate strategies for their markets and economic environments.
   The present article conceives of new venture mortality as similar in nature to patterns of development that we observe, for instance, in human embryos or in the formation of new species. That is, development is an inherently hazardous process.
   Some of the specific hazards of development are:
   1. Generic Entry Barriers. It is generally not possible for a new firm or product to successfully enter an already crowded, stable market where competitors are strong. It is more feasible instead to enter a new or growing marker; or to enter with a ''substitute'' product that is clearly superior to those existing; or to exploit an unnoticed market opening; or to develop competitive strengths ''secretly,'' without overtly challenging others in the industry.
   2. Density of Developmental Hurdles. Any new entity must clear a sequence of important hurdles on its way to maturity, such as establishing a well-ordered office, a functional sales channel, etc. Failure at any one hurdle is potentially fatal, and a mathematical analysis shows that the likelihood of passing even 10 hurdles in a row is about one in three. The earliest hurdles tend to be the most difficult and to crowd more densely than later hurdles. Particularly troublesome are ''phase changes'' where a company first starts business or becomes one thing rather than another within a short period of time.
   3. Amplification of Maturational Error. Any complex system that grows rapidly and is unable to predict the future perfectly is going to accumulate structural errors that become very difficult to remedy. This is a natural and inevitable developmental process, as the system grows in complexity and the flaw itself becomes a pillar of the system. If an imitator or competitor arrives soon afterward and spots the error, he or she will easily be able to retool and redesign a better system, whereas the first firm is stuck with old habits, tools, dies, and production methods.
   4. Sequence and Control in Development. Every embryonic organism has a design template outlined in its DNA that is carefully followed. Both the developing fetus itself and the mother have monitoring and control mechanisms that trigger an abortion if the development process goes awry. New ventures lack such mechanisms. They are more susceptible to ''developmental deviance,'' likely to differ from the model successful corporation of their type.
   5. Smallness and the Asymmetry of Luck. Small things are more subject to the whims of fate than big things. Amount of resources is the key. Because new ventures typically start off with scarce resources, a bad bounce can sink the company, and the probability of at least one such bad bounce is high.
   6. Costs of Organizing. Like all of the larger-brained mammals, a new company, such as a medical supply firm, must learn through experience much of what it means to be mature. Costs associated with learning arrive just when the Jinn is most vulnerable and distracted by other challenges.
   In one sense, the message of this article is good news, in that managers of failed enterprises need not assume all the blame. After all, if most new businesses do poorly, then failure is the average or typical case, and it makes little sense to say that the average manager is ''poor.'' The bad news is that, if our perspective is correct, managers of new ventures have less scope to influence the success of their enterprises than is commonly believed. The managerial recommendations that emerge are that new ventures are more likely to succeed to the extent that they: have sponsorship or capital, have managers with a range of experience in previous ventures, are given extra assistance of ''shelter,'' or can ensure a high probability of passing all of the hurdles faced by a new venture.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients (n = 335) in the US Air Force HIV Natural History Program were followed for 3 years (mean) after skin testing, immunophenotyping of CD4(+) cell subsets, and measurement of in vitro interleukin-2 production after stimulation by phytohemagglutinin, alloantigens, tetanus toroid, and influenza A virus. The T cell functional assay predicted survival time (P < .001) and time for progression to AIDS (P = .014). Skin testing for tetanus, mumps, and Candida antigen and the total number of positive tests (P < .001 for each) stratified patients for survival time. In a multivariable proportional hazards model, the T cell functional assay (P = .008), the absolute number of CD4(+) T cells (P = .001), the percentage of CD4(+)CD29(+) cells (P = .06), and the number of reactive skin tests (P < .001) predicted survival time. Thus, cellular immune functional tests have significant predictive value for survival time in HIV-l-infected patients independent of CD4(+) cell count.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF A SPATIAL KNOWLEDGE-BASE SYSTEM FOR ENVIRONMENT
   PROTECTION - THE ARSEN PROJECT
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of a decision support system dedicated to the study of phenomena taking place in the environment requires a good representation of spatial knowledge: geometrical objects and spatial processes have to be taken into account for the construction of such a system. The aim of these spatial representations is to apply one or more models. Several systems have been developed in France recently for different natural hazards: snow avalanches, slopes stability, forest fires, snowdrift and torrential floods. For each of these applications, the representation of space has been studied and implemented separately in different manners.
   The aim of the ARSEN project is to take advantage of this experience to build a kernel of spatial objects and methods which could be used as a generic tool. It will be integrated in future systems to organize and manipulate spatial knowledge in order to get a simulation of natural hazards and face real-time crises. The main advantages of such a tool should be: (a) to allow an easy integration of different models concerning natural phenomena, by supporting the construction of the spatial representations required by these models; (b) to make the access to spatial knowledge as easy as possible, whatever this knowledge is (geometrical and topological description).
   In the first part, this paper gives a few samples of objects and processing methods used in the already existing systems. We lay emphasis on the analogy between these different applications and we try to make an analysis of the spatial representation requirements. Then, we suggest a definition of the kernel of ARSEN. In this second part we describe the spatial knowledge organisation and the common methods. In a third part, we describe the way in which ARSEN is implemented. This part is the most technical one, describing the way the links between the spatial objects are organized and programmed. Finally, we present applications where the kernel of ARSEN is used to take into account rock falls and snow avalanches.

TI LATE SURVIVAL RISK-FACTORS FOR ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM REPAIR -
   EXPERIENCE FROM 14 DEPARTMENT-OF-VETERANS-AFFAIRS HOSPITALS
SO SURGERY
LA English
DT Article

AB Background. This study evaluates late survival risk factors for patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgical procedures performed at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals across the United States between 1985 and 1987.
   Methods. Preoperative risk factors for a representative sample of 280 male veterans were obtained from an extensive Department of Veterans Affairs office of Quality Management study and subsequent chart review. The National Death Index was used to determine survival through December 1991.
   Results. Mortality at 30 days was 2.9%. Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities were 89% (+/-2%) at 1 year and 64% (+/-3%) at 5 years. Multivariate hazards models indicated significantly poorer survival for patients with age greater than 69 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy. A history of coronary artery disease including previous myocardial infarction or bypass operation did not predict late survival for this cohort.
   Conclusions. Given the substantial burden of comorbidity of veterans who use Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, the overall survival experience of this all mab cohort compares well with previously published series and with overall U.S. male life expectancy. The fact that a history of coronary artery disease did not predict survival for this cohort may be related to selection bias; however, a more likely explanation is the presence of unsuspected coronary disease among patients without a documented history of angina or myocardial infarction.

TI ICE IN THE 1994 RABAUL ERUPTION CLOUD - IMPLICATIONS FOR VOLCANO HAZARD
   AND ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB VOLCANIC clouds are an important natural hazard to aircraft(1), and host chemical reactions that interest both volcanologists(2,3) and atmospheric scientists(4-6). Ice has been suggested as a possible component of eruption clouds', but there has been no direct evidence for its presence. Here we report the detection, using a satellite-borne infrared sensor, of greater than or similar to 2 million tonnes of ice in the cloud produced by the September 1994 eruption of Rabaul volcano, in Papua New Guinea. The cloud also contained relatively low levels of sulphur dioxide (80+/-50 kilotonnes), compared with other stratospheric eruption clouds. The unusual aspects of this cloud may be related to the entry of sea water into the volcanic vent, and its participation in the eruption column. Past eruptions that occurred in similar (coastal) settings, such as those of Krakatau and Santorini, might have had less effect on the atmosphere than their volume alone would suggest, because the presence of ice may decrease the residence time of ash and sulphur in the atmosphere. In addition, the ability of ice to mask the characteristic spectral signature of volcanic ash will increase the difficulty of designing airborne ash detection systems for aviation safety.

AB Objective: To estimate the frequency of acute retroviral syndrome associated with HIV infection among injecting drug users (IDU), and to determine the extent to which acute retroviral syndrome predicts a faster rate of progression to AIDS and immunosuppression in this population.
   Design: Prospective study of HIV seroconverters (median follow-up, 50.5 months).
   Setting: Sixteen clinical centres throughout Italy established to study the natural history of HIV infection.
   Patients: Three hundred and ninety-one IDU for whom the date of HIV seroconversion was established with a 9-month precision.
   Main outcome measures and methods: Incidence of acute retroviral syndrome with signs and symptoms that included fever (temperature >38 degrees C) occurring within 6 months prior to the time of first positive HIV test, progression to AIDS, crude and adjusted relative hazard of AIDS using survival analysis techniques, and trajectories of CD4+ cell counts using a piece-wise linear regression model incorporating the degree of dependency of within-person measurements.
   Results: Of 391 HIV seroconverters, 39 (10.0%) were diagnosed with acute retroviral syndrome. During follow-up, 13 seroconverters with acute retroviral syndrome and 24 asymptomatic seroconverters developed AIDS. The Kaplan-Meier estimates for the cumulative AIDS incidence during 4.5 years of follow-up were 26.8 and 6.5%, respectively; the relative hazard of developing AIDS for acute retroviral syndrome was 5.59 (95% confidence interval, 2.79-11.20) after adjustment for age, sex and year of seroconversion. Although CD4+ level within the first year from seroconversion was similar, the rate of CD4+ cell decline after 1 year from seroconversion was faster in individuals with acute retroviral syndrome than in those without this syndrome (P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Among HIV-infected IDU, a distinct acute retroviral syndrome is apparent and associated with a faster rate of clinical progression to AIDS and HIV-related immunosuppression.

AB The treatment of idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy remains an enigma. We have reviewed many of the important clinical trials concerning membranous glomerulopathy using a meta-analysis and a secondary pooled analysis to test the effects of corticosteroid or alkylating therapy compared with no treatment on renal survival and complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome, A search was performed using MEDLINE (1968 through 1993) for articles on idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy and glomerulonephritis. Bibliographies of articles were reviewed for completeness. Sixty-nine articles were reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed for four trials that evaluated corticosteroids compared with no treatment and for three trials that evaluated alkylating therapy compared with no treatment, Pooled analysis was performed on randomized and prospective studies (10 studies) and then with 22 case series added. All studies evaluated renal biopsy-proven disease. Meta-analysis was performed on the relative chance of being in complete remission for each study. Renal survival could be evaluated by pooled analysis only. For pooled analyses, Cox's proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to test the effect of therapy on renal survival and the nephrotic syndrome, respectively. Data concerning gender, nephrotic syndrome, and geographic region were used in all statistical models. Evaluation of renal survival revealed no differences by treatment group (P > 0.1). By meta-analysis, the relative chance of complete remission was not improved for corticosteroid-treated patients (1.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 2.44; P > 0.1), but was improved for patients treated with alkylating agents (4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 15.96; P < 0.05) when compared with no treatment. Pooled analysis of randomized and prospective studies, as well pooled analysis with all studies, supported the findings of the meta-analysis. Corticosteroids or alkylating therapy did not improve renal survival in idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy. Complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed more frequently with the use of alkylating agents. (C) 1995 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB Over 1200 patients with motor neuron disease have been carefully diagnosed, followed, and included in a detailed database delineating characteristics of the disease. Of these patients, 831 were identified as exhibiting typical sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The progression of the disease in these patients has been followed with our scoring system and the ALS score was verified as a significant covariate of survival. Age at first symptom, delay from first symptom to entering ALS clinic, and rate of change of respiratory function were also identified as significant covariates of survival. These measures, applied to the Cox proportional hazards model, were used to develop a mathematical model for prediction of survival time in ALS, which proved highly accurate for the 80% of patients at intermediate risk. For those patients, a second model was developed which accurately predicts, after an initial period of observation, the time over which ALS patients will decline a set number of points in total ALS score. Such validation permits initial trials for drug therapies in ALS by comparison of relatively small groups of treated patients to this historical control group, based on the model of predicted time to a particular decrement in fetal ALS score.

TI An assessment of coping with environmental hazards in northern

SO CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
LA English
DT Article
AB impressions of the north, its landscape, and people are drawn largely from public images, not personal experience, making misconceptions commonplace among non-residents. The objective of this research is to improve our understanding of how communities cope with flood hazards through an assessment of the complex integration of traditional knowledge, community evolution, and modern technologies. This intersection of forces could influence vulnerability to natural hazards and affect preparedness and response. Field investigations were conducted in Aklavik, N.W.T. Attawapiskat, Ontario, and Fort Liard, N.W.T. as case studies. Central to the research design are distinctions between perceptions, attitudes, and activities at three operational levels: individual; communal; governmental - and an appreciation of how these levels interrelate in response to flood hazards. The research findings confirm the crucial value of local environmental knowledge, identify the influence oi changing social structures on community vulnerability, and underline the jurisdictionally integrated character of disaster response.

AB Three fish species (Diplodus annularis, Scorpaena porcus and Scorpaena scrofa) were sampled off the coast of the industrialized area of Sfax, The distribution of Cd, Cu and Zn was examined in different fractions of both gills and liver: insoluble fraction and cytosol divided into thermolabile compounds and heat-stable compounds, In the latest fraction, quantitative analysis of metallothionein-like proteins (MTLP) was achieved by using differential pulse polarography, In the gills, the insoluble fraction was the major compartment for the storage of all three metals, In the liver, 50% Cd and Cu at least were also associated with this fraction whereas Zn was bound primarily with heat-stable compounds, a pattern which is probably due to the role of MTLP in Zn homeostasis and to the fact that Zn is a constituent element of metallothionein, According to the species, one eighth to a little more than one quarter of Cd, Cu or Zn was bound to the thermolabile fraction in the liver, probably due to the presence of numerous enzymes involved in the metabolic functions of this organ, In both gills and liver, Cd and Cu concentrations in the thermolabile fraction were increased with increasing organ burden of these metals, This observation suggests an enhancement of the toxic hazard since this fraction includes metabolic targets of metals, Statistically significant relationships have been shown between metals and MTLP concentrations in both organs, However, the use of MTLP as a biomarker has to be revised in the light of natural changes (according to age, sex, etc.) which could conceal variations due to metabolic pollution.

AB We present three empirical methods for risk assessment in field studies of free-ranging vertebrates. First, we advocate statistical inference concerning population recruitment or mortality in response to ecological hazards. Second, if inferences about both recruitment and mortality are available, one can use a Leslie-Lefkovitch matrix to estimate the finite rate of population change (lambda) as a function of ecological hazards. Third, designed experiments can be conducted on samples of marked animals in natural environments to assess impacts and risks. These methods rely on either sophisticated capture-recapture or radio-tracking models, and on well-developed analysis theory. The use of uniquely marked animals is somewhat analogous to the use of tracers in other areas of risk assessmenl. We present examples of each approach and discuss some limitations.

TI ON SOME APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICAL-METHODS IN REMOTE-SENSING
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED MATHEMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the recent years Remote Sensing of earth has gained wide popularity in view of its regional and repetitive coverage in a cost effective manner. Remote sensing data being bulk in nature is subjected to statistical analysis for deriving meaningful information pertaining to mapping, monitoring and assessment of natural resources in addition to monitoring of natural hazards. Classification techniques are extensively ,applied for generation of thematic maps of soil, forestry applications. The sampling techniques are used for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps and generation of forest resources inventory. Relaxation techniques are being utilised in image analysis for edge detection and enhancement, shape recognition etc. Texture analysis of remote sensing data reveals regions of interest in an image. The multivariate statistical analysis of geological maps derived from remote sensing data are being applied for mineral exploration studies. The soil expert system developed utilising satellite image can be put to use as a tool for training soil scientistis. The present paper deals with many of these statistical techniques as applied in remote senging data for natural resources mapping and management.

ID ABATTOIR-ASSOCIATED DISEASE; TRANSMISSION; MELITENSIS
AB In 1992, the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources received 18 case reports of brucellosis from a county health department. All patients had potential exposure to the hill floor of one pork processing plant. A subsequent National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health health hazard evaluation surveyed 154 (99%) of 156 kill floor workers of this plant and found that 30 (19%) had evidence of recent (or persistent) brucellosis. These data show that significant exposure to Brucella is occurring among packing plant workers in North Carolina and suggest that some of the approximately 38,000 production workers in pork processing plants in the United States are at risk of contracting swine brucellosis. Additional measures may need to be taken to prevent occupational exposure to Brucella.

AB The species-specific advantages and significant nutritional and health benefits of breast-feeding are widely acknowledged. Less recognized are the advantages of the process of breast-feeding itself. Adherence to the natural mechanics of breast-feeding will preclude many of the problems associated with improper bottle feeding. For example, the semiupright position of the infant during breastfeeding helps eliminate the entry of milk into the middle ear and reduces choking and regurgitation. The action of suckling during breast-feeding minimizes the intake of air. In addition, the direct eye contact that is natural to breast-feeding fosters bonding, and the close body contact promotes a sense of security in the child. These advantages, so natural to breast-feeding, are likely to be absent from bottle feeding unless some of the natural techniques associated with breast-feeding are adopted. This article describes various aspects of the breast-feeding process with the goal of urging practitioners to instruct patients to transfer these techniques to bottle feeding. In so doing, clinicians may help their patients avoid the hazards of improper bottle feeding.

AB About 1 million people live at risk in Arequipa city which lies 15 km from the vent of the active El Misti stratovolcano (5,825 m), in the Pliocene to Holocene Central Andean Volcanic Zone.  Built on volcaniclastic bedrock, El Misti encompasses a stratovolcano of Pleistocene age and a modern stratocone.  The bulk of the modern strato-cone consists of a series of stubby lava flows and pyroclastic debris reaching 2,800 m in thickness.  The interpretation of eighteen tephra profiles situated in gorges of the western to southeastern foot of the El Misti volcano shows that the volcano has erupted repeatedly during the upper Pleistocene, the more recent products corresponding to repeated plinian eruptions.  The uppermost huge tephra sequence lies on a poorly developed palaeosol containing charcoal that was dated by C-14 method at 1,920 +/- 200 yrs BP.  Historical data refer to some volcanic activity at AD 1440-1470.  Based on the tephrostratigraphic study, the most important volcanic hazards for the 900,000 inhabitants of Arequipa are four-fold:  tephra fallout as thick as 50 cm falling from high plinian columns, pyroclastic flows expected in any valley towards the northern suburbs, lahars during the wet season (December to March), and uncommon debris avalanches.

AB Background. Anatomic location has been identified by several investigators as a significant prognostic factor for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma (CM). However, the best determination of higher and lower risk sites is still controversial, and the biologic significance of tumor site in the course of primary CM is unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify higher and lower risk sites based on multivariate analysis.
   Methods. A series of 5093 patients with invasive primary cutaneous melanoma followed from 1970 to 1988 at four university centers in Germany was investigated using the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model to analyze the importance of anatomic location for survival probability.
   Results. The anatomic location was found to be a highly significant prognostic factor for patients with primary melanoma by multivariate analysis (P < 0.0001). An optimized classification into sites of higher and lower risk with respect to survival was evaluated by multivariate analysis controlling for the possible confounding effects of the other significant prognostic factors. Relative to the lower leg as the prognostically favorable baseline, the following locations were associated with a significantly higher risk of death caused by primary cutaneous melanoma: back and breast (thorax), upper arm, neck, and scalp (TANS regions). The lower trunk, thigh, lower leg, foot, lower arms, hands, and face were identified as lower risk sites.
   Conclusions. Anatomic location was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. The TANS regions were identified as high risk sites, and the lower trunk, thigh, lower leg, foot, lower arms, hands, and face were identified as intermediate sites.

AB PURPOSE: Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study was undertaken to identify the natural history of this condition, including risk factors for its development, and outcome.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of atrial fibrillation among 3,983 male air crew recruits observed continuously for 44 years was calculated based on person-years of observation. Age and 23 variables were examined to identify risk factors for atrial fibrillation. Controlling for age and 9 prognostic variables, the effect of atrial fibrillation on 8 outcomes was examined. Analysis of risk factors for atrial fibrillation and outcome after atrial fibrillation was based on a Cox proportional hazard model using time-dependent covariates.
   RESULTS: Of the 3,983 study members, 299 (7.5%) developed atrial fibrillation during 154,131 person-years of observation. The incidence rose with age from less than 0.5 per 1,000 person-years before age 50 to 9.7 per 1,000 person-years after age 70. Risk for atrial fibrillation was increased with myocardial infarction (relative risk [RR] 3.62), angina (RR 2.84), and ST-T wave abnormalities in the absence of ischemic heart disease (RR 2.21). The RR for atrial fibrillation was strongest at the onset of ischemic heart disease and diminished over time. The rate of atrial fibrillation was 1.42 times increased in men with a history of hypertension. Congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy were important but uncommon risk factors. Atrial fibrillation independently increased the risk for stroke (RR 2.07) and congestive heart failure (RR 2.98). Total mortality rate was increased 1.31 times; cardiovascular mortality including and excluding fatal stroke were also increased (RR 1.41 and 1.37, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of atrial fibrillation in men increases with advancing age. Clinical cardiac abnormalities, particularly recent ischemic heart disease and hypertension, are strongly associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation increases morbidity and mortality, but the magnitude of the increase may be less than previously reported.

AB Topical toxicity bioassays were undertaken with the organophosphate compound dimethoate, O,O-dimethyl S-methylcarbamoylmethyl phosphorodithioate, against six species of predatory Coleoptera that are recognized predators of cereal aphids: the, staphylinid Tachyporus hypnorum, the coccinellid Coccinella septempunctata and the carabids Demetrias atricapillus, Trechus quadristriatus, Bembidion obtusum and Nebria brevicollis. LD(50) values for formulated dimethoate, diluted in water, varied between 3.4 and 98.8 ng a.i. insect(-1) and 1.45 and 18.20 mu g a.i. g(-1) body weight. These values were similar to those obtained in another study by Wiles and Jepson (1992) for the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin, (S)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1R)-cis-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2,-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate. Hazard ratios were calculated for dimethoate and deltamethrin by dividing recommended field mass application rate in g a.i. ha(-1) by LD(50) in mu g a.i. insect(-1): this gave an indication of potential direct exposure hazard. The range of values for dimethoate (3,441 to 100,000) were well in excess of those for deltamethrin (28.6 to 500) because of its greater field application rate (340 g a.i. ha(-1) compared with 6.25 g ai ha(-1)). LT(50)s were determined for adult C. septempunctata exposed to wheat leaves treated with either dimethoate or deltamethrin at full or half field rate within in-situ bioassays. At both rates, the dimethoate LT(50)s were shorter, ranging at full rate from 0.06 to 7.70 h, between 2 and 96 h after treatment, compared with 1.04 to 20.89 h after the same time intervals for deltamethrin. At half-field rate, the equivalent LT(50) ranges were 0.52 to 13.65 h for dimethoate and 3.75 to 31.76 h for deltamethrin. The relative toxicities of the two insecticides, expressed as the ratio of log (x + 1) LT(50) deltamethrin:dimethoate, narrowed greatly between 2 and 24 h, especially in the full rate treatment, indicating a more rapid loss of dimethoate than deltamethrin from foliage in the field shortly after spray application. The ecotoxicological consequences of exposure to dimethoate and deltamethrin are compared relative to their differing mass application rates, physicochemical properties and environmental fate. The role and value of laboratory-based toxicological testing within risk analysis procedures is discussed.

TI TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC - SPATIAL PATTERNS AND
   RELATIONSHIPS TO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION AND SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA English
DT Article
ID REGION
AB An analysis of a 20-yr dataset of tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific has been made to determine the spatial patterns of cyclone occurrence and how these depend on the Southern Oscillation (SO) and sea surface temperature. A local measure of cyclone incidence is defined as the number of cyclones that enter into a 2 degrees lat-long square during some period (e.g., within one season) and this quantity is mapped for four Southern Oscillation index (SOI) categories. The maps show that the geographical distribution of cyclone incidence shifts eastward and northward during negative SOI phases and vice versa. The mean annual incidence for the whole region is 28% higher than average for our strongly negative SO category and 16% below average for our near-zero category.
   To explore the roles of the SO and local SST, correlation analysis was applied to mean values of cyclone incidence for four subregions of 20 degrees longitude width between 10 degrees and 22 degrees S. Markedly different SOI/SST responses were found on either side of 170 degrees E. In the Coral Sea subregion (150 degrees-170 degrees E), seasons with a relatively high tropical cyclone incidence were preceded by significant positive anomalies in SST and weak positive anomalies of the SOI. The behaviors of the three eastern subregions (lying between 170 degrees E and 130 degrees W) were similar to each other, but were very different to that of the Coral Sea subregion. Their seasons of higher cyclone incidence were preceded by significant negative anomalies of SOI and Tahiti pressure,which continued into the cyclone season, but with only weak or nil SST relationships. Analysis of variance was used to determine the relative contributions of the main variables for each subregion. Altogether, SOI/SST variables before the cyclone season can explain from 20% to 50% of the variance for the individual subregions. Concurrent variables can explain 70% of the variance for the three eastern subregions taken as a single unit.
   On the basis of these statistical results, the authors proposed that the primary influence on tropical cyclone incidence west of 170 degrees E is the local oceanic conditions, as represented by SST, while to the east of 170 degrees E it is the eastward extent of favorable atmospheric conditions, as indicated by the SOI or Tahiti pressure. The results have application to seasonal cyclone forecasting and natural hazard assessment and mitigation activities within the region.

AB The neurotoxic effects of monocrotophos on the brain of the nile tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) were examined, using a static bioassay under laboratory conditions. By probit analysis the 96 h LC(50) value of monocrotophos was 4.9 mg/l. After 96 h exposure to acute levels of monocrotophos, the brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity decreased progressively as the concentration of monocrotophos increased. In addition, four weeks following transfer to toxicant-free water after exposure to 1 mg monocrotophos, nile tilapia fish brain regained 95% of control AChE activity. The results indicate that inhibition of AChE activity in fish exposed to monocrotophos may serve as an indicator of hazard due to application of this chemical in the natural environment.

AB There are areas in the boreal forest where the combination of highly flammable vegetation and frequent ignition events create a high fire hazard. The resultant fires cause considerable economic and social damage. During global change, fire frequency may increase in parts of the boreal forest. We are investigating the feasibility of using less-flammable vegetation to reduce the number of people-caused fires in herbaceous communities of northern Ontario. Herbaceous species abundant in these areas were ranked according to potential ignitability. Ignitability was estimated from chemical and physical fuel characteristics measured on live and dead tissue. Achillea millefolium, Aster macrophyllus and Anaphalis margaritacea had the lowest potential ignitability. Their rank was consistent for fuel characteristics measured on live and dead leaf tissue. Many of the commercially available forbs tested (e.g., Trifolium spp.) were of low to intermediate ignitability. Grass species such as Poa compressa and Agrostis scabra had the highest potential ignitability. Physical characteristics were not significantly correlated with chemical characteristics (p > 0.05, n = 20). There was a significant but trivial correlation between surface area to volume ratio and volume (r = -0.80, p less than or equal to 0.05, n = 20). There was a significant correlation between surface area to volume ratio and density (r = 0.54, p less than or equal to 0.05, n = 20). There was a significant correlation between total ash and silica-free ash content (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05, n = 47), between total ash and energy content (r = -0.55, p less than or equal to 0.05, n = 47) and between silica free ash and energy content (r = -0.28, p less than or equal to 0.05, n = 47). Research is continuing to evaluate the feasibility of using less-flammable plants for fire hazard reduction. Planting less-flammable vegetation in fire prone areas, or around property and fire-sensitive natural areas, may help prevent ignition or slow fire spread. This technique could be a long term, cost effective and environmentally friendly method of fire prevention and control in selected areas of the boreal forest.

AB Insect populations have a substantial impact on Canada's forest. They are a dominating disturbance factor and during outbreaks they can cause tree mortality over vast areas of forest. If the predicted climate changes take effect, the damage patterns caused by insects may be drastically altered, especially for the many insects whose occurrence in time and space is severely limited by climatic factors. This possibility substantially increases the uncertainties associated with the long-term planning of pest control requirements, with hazard rating models, with depletion forecasts, and with projections for the sustainability of future timber supplies. Moreover, because insect damage affects the rates of various processes in nutrient and biogeochemical cycling, potential changes in damage patterns can affect ecosystem resilience. This paper presents a number of plausible scenarios that describe how some key processes in the boreal forest's insect defoliator outbreak systems may respond to climate change. The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clem. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is used as an illustrative case study throughout. The potential importance of phenological synchrony in the dynamical interactions between species is emphasised. It is argued that natural selection may be a particularly important process in the response of insects to climate change and that climate change may already be influencing some insect lifecycles. The importance of threshold effects, rare but extreme events, and transient dynamics is emphasised, and the inadequacy of 'equilibrium' models for forest:pest systems noted. We conclude by discussing approaches to developing forecasts of how one of the boreal forest's insect defoliator-based disturbance regimes, as a whole, might respond to climate change.

AB Background: Imported fire ants (IFA) are a common cause of insect venom hypersensitivity in the southeastern United Stares. The purpose of this study was to determine the sting attack rate and development of specific IgE in an unsensitized population.
   Methods: Study participants consisted of 137 medical students with limited exposure to IFA-endemic areas who were temporarily training in San Antonio, Tex. Subjects were surveyed for prior IFA exposure with a questionnaire, and IFA-specific IgE was evaluated with RAST and intradermal skin testing. Evaluations were performed on arrival and reported at departure from the endemic area 3 weeks later.
   Results: One hundred seven subjects completed the study. Field stings were reported in 55 subjects, resulting in a sting attack rate of 51%. In these 55 subjects 53 (96%) reported a pustule or a small local reaction at the sting site, one (2%) reported an isolated large local reaction, and none reported a systemic reaction. At the 3-week follow-up skin test and RAST conversions occurred in seven subjects (13%) and in one subject (1.8%), respectively.
   Conclusions: Even brief exposures to IFA-endemic areas result in significant sting rates and concurrent rapid development of IFA-specific IgE in 16% of stung subjects.

TI INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG SEISMIC AND SHORT-TERM TECTONIC ACTIVITY, OIL
   AND GAS-PRODUCTION, AND GAS MIGRATION TO THE SURFACE
SO JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental impacts of (1) oil and gas production from hydrocarbon fields, (2) seismic and short-term tectonic activity, and (3) increase in upward gas migration along faults and fractures due to seismic activity are discussed, Natural seismic activity, generally underestimated for platform conditions, may cause disruption of oil and gas production. There is a vast amount of experimental data showing the influence of the processes of petroleum production on local seismic activity and demonstrating that petroleum production may be the cause not only of ground subsidence but may also trigger small- and medium-size earthquakes. In turn, experiments with artificial sources of vibro-seismic energy show that seismic vibrations (artificial or natural) may cause an increase in gas migration to the surface, This means that in seismically active areas, gas leakage at the surface over petroleum reservoirs can present more serious environmental problems, compared to the areas with relatively low seismic activity, Increased hydrocarbon gas migration from the oil and gas fields to the surface can be caused by artificial seismic sources, The authors observed that upon release of artificial energy to the reservoirs, the migration of gases to the surface increases.
   Additional information for identification of faults that may serve as structural traps for hydrocarbons may be obtained via monitoring short-term tectonic activity in the vicinity of hydrocarbon fields and monitoring of gas concentration anomalies near the earth surface over petroleum fields.
   The multi-parameter monitoring of tectonic, seismic and geochemical factors in the Tengiz (a very large oilfield in Kazakhstan) gives an important example of the system aimed at monitoring of the potential environmental hazards related to interaction of tectonic and seismic factors with petroleum production.

AB Background. Controversy exists concerning the natural history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, including its pathologic expression and treatment. This controversy has been fostered largely bf the retrospective nature and limited sample sizes of extant studies.
   Method. Resolution of some of these issues was attempted by analyzing the pathologic features of 573 examples of DCIS obtained from a larger cohort of 790 women with DCIS enrolled in Protocol B-17 of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project. This prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to assess the efficacy of local breast irradiation to reduce the incidence of second ipsilateral breast tumors (IBT) after lumpectomy.
   Results. Tumor and patient characteristics, including significantly less IBT for those treated by lumpectomy and irradiation than lumpectomy alone, were almost identical for the subset comprising this analysis and the total B-17 cohort reported previously. The presence of moderate/marked comedo necrosis, which was evaluated as an independent parameter rather than as a specific histologic type of DCIS and uncertain/involved lumpectomy margins were the only statistically significant independent predictors of IBT for patients treated by lumpectomy as well as irradiation. The latter markedly reduced the annual hazard rates for the IBT associated with these indicators.
   Conclusions. Although not an endpoint of this study, the authors' findings suggest that the beneficial effect of irradiation in reducing IBT after lumpectomy for DCIS occurs with small (<1.0 cm.) and larger lesions. Moderate/marked comedo necrosis and uncertain/involved lumpectomy margins represent independent predictors of IBT.

AB Objective: To determine the impact of the introduction of clarithromycin and azithromycin on the treatment and survival of patients with AIDS and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (DMAC).
   Design: Retrospective review over a 3.5-year interval.
   Setting: Tertiary-care, university teaching hospital.
   Patients: Charts of all patients with cultures of brood or bone-marrow positive for acid-fast bacilli (n = 103) were reviewed. Data on laboratory results at the time of DMAC diagnosis, antimycobacterial therapy, antiretroviral therapy, and survival was collected.
   Results: Prior to the availability of clarithromycin and azithromycin 61.5% of patients received antimycobacterial treatment compared with 92% afterwards (P=0.0014). Median survival of treated patients was 255 versus 145 days for untreated patients (P<0.001). Median survival of macrolide-treated patients was 284 versus 168 days for patients receiving treatment without a macrolide (P=0.09). Univariate predictors of survival were antimycobacterial treatment, use of antiretrovirals, and year of diagnosis. In a multivariate model, no antimycobacterial treatment (hazard ratio, 3.83; P=0.003) was associated with shorter survival, and treatment without a macrolide (hazard ratio, 2.29; P=0.075) showed a trend towards shorter survival versus treatment with macrolide-containing regimens.
   Conclusions: The introduction of clarithromycin and azithromycin has been associated with an increase in the proportion of patients with DMAC receiving treatment and with increased survival of these patients.

TI ESTIMATING ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY - QUANTIFYING THE UNKNOWN
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CANCER; 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-PARA-DIOXIN; RISKS
AB This article describes a methodology firms can use to estimate their unknown future environmental liabilities.  The authors developed it for a U.S. manufacturing firm to help it better negotiate with its insurance carriers about past and future coverage.  The basic method can be applied by any company to estimate its own overall future environmental liability.  The article examines multiple categories of potential liability such as hazardous waste, community exposure, occupational hazards beyond workers' compensation, product liability, and natural resource damage.  Initial hazardous waste estimates can be derived from aggregate clean-up costs for the nation as a whole.  The other categories entail more subjective estimates based on possible pathways to exposure, legal proceedings, and comparisons against benchmark cases such as asbestos.

DT Article
DE LASER SAFETY; ELECTRICAL HAZARDS
AB The range and degree of electrical hazards associated with lasers is generally greater than encountered with other forms of equipment in the industrial, commercial, or scientific sectors. In laser equipment the electrical energy conversion to 'optical' wavelength energy is achieved by many methods, each method having differing electrical safety hazard exposures. Laser output is described in terms of beam power, energy, wavelength, and spatial characteristics, enabling common points of comparison and beam hazard characterization. In contrast, the methods of electrical energy conversion have unique characteristics which are not generally appreciated. It is natural to expect this, as it is the laser beam that is the instrument of useful work, not the manner in which the beam is produced. The fact that certain energy conversion methods require electrical equipment having more in common with radar transmitters leaves open the problem of severe electrical hazards through unfamiliarity and inexperience. Many severe electric shock accidents with laser power-supply and pulse-forming equipment have occurred for these reasons. Several common electrical energy conversion systems and their general electrical safety requirements are discussed and connections to the requirements and expectations of current codes and regulations are explored. An understanding of the triad of equipment exposures, equipment environment, and the human element is developed to provide a greater appreciation of the necessity for recognition, evaluation, and control if electric shock accidents are to be avoided.

AB When survival data can be divided into natural groups, such as in a clinical trial with patients from a number of different institutions, the question arises whether effects are different for the different groups. For situations where one is concerned with a random pattern of variation over groups, this article proposes testing the null hypothesis of no variation using statistics based on the sums of martingale residuals over subjects within groups. These tests are closely related to the locally most powerful tests of Liang for testing for variation across a large number of strata. The tests are applied to data from a lung cancer trial conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.

TI THE MARINE CORRIDOR PROJECT - AN INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP OF
   GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, AND ACADEMIA
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Marine Corridor (MARICO) Project is a bold and visionary concept that is expected to transform Japan's Osaka Bay into a trade and industry center, marine and environmental research site, international cultural and intellectual center, and prototypical city of the future-while concurrently addressing the severe housing, transportation and pollution problems common to heavily urbanized areas, including the Kansai region encompassing Osaka Bay. In fact, very high population density and limited coastal space for expansion are major factors that have led to MARICO.
   The heart of MARICO is a marine-based transportation utility, and telecommunications infrastructure corridor linking nine urban centers now located on the bay's perimeter. It will serve as the foundation upon which will be constructed marine-based city complexes to accommodate urban growth in land-poor Japan and to stimulate business and industrial growth. For descriptive purposes, MARICO could be considered analogous to the high way beltways developed to support growth in Boston, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis, and other U.S. cities (Conway 1993). The MARICO Project will give high priority to prevailing concerns on the impact of natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons.
   Construction of the 17-trillion-yen ($170 billion, at 100 yen per $1) public works project is proposed to commence at the turn of the century and be completed in phases over the following eighteen years. A mammoth scientific and technological challenge, MARICO was conceived and launched as a model requiring the cooperation of government, industry, and academia. Initial funding has been provided by the private sector and local governments, with conceptual input by key ocean technology faculty from national and foreign institutions. The enormity and multidisciplined aspects of this project preclude an in-depth analysis in this paper, and instead a technical overview is presented.

LA English
DT Article
DE VOLCANIC EMISSIONS; VOLCANIC AEROSOLS; DRY FOGS; VOLCANIC HAZARDS;
   VOLCANOS; ITALY
ID IONIAN SEA CORES; GREENLAND
AB Intense natural pollution has occurred in the past in Italy corresponding to intense volcanic activity, which appears to have diminished somewhat in recent times. Between 1500 and 1900, Etna, Vesuvius, Vulcano and Stromboli, plus volcanoes outside Italy were very active and there are numerous, well documented episodes of atmospheric acidification which caused widespread damage, especially to the vegetation. Other than the acid rains, volcanic emissions also caused so called dry fogs which consist of a more or less dense mist composed of foul smelling gases and aerosols, characterized by a reddish color, that could appear and persist when the relative humidity was low as shown by measurements taken on such occasions. This phenomenon appeared most frequently at the beginning of the hot season. In fact, volcanic clouds of gases and aerosols formed especially when the Tyrrhenian sea water was relatively cold giving rise to very stable atmospheric conditions locally and the summer anticyclone meant that the winds were calm. Under such conditions the emissions of Stromboli and Vulcano, especially those emitted at low levels, remained entrapped in the stable layer, which were then transported towards the land reaching Northern Italy at a distance on the order of 10(3) km. The dry fogs could persist for days or weeks. Harvests were seriously damaged and frequently the crops were subsequently attacked by parasites. The leaves of the vegetation became discoloured with numerous punctiform lesions or gangrene at the edges of the leaves. The phenomenon was so frequent that, in texts on agricultural meteorology of the 1800s, it distinction was made between the caustic dry fogs which damaged the vegetation and damp fags which instead were good for it. The most important episode occurred in 1783 due to the activity of Laki Grimsvotn (Iceland) with the contribution of Italian volcanoes. This dry fog lasted many months and affected the greater part of the northern hemisphere including Europe and Asia, harming people, animals and vegetation. Apart from paroxysmal cases, from the 1300s up to today, some tens of dry fogs have been noted, all of which have been sufficiently well documented. The frequency of these events culminated between the middle of the 1700s and the middle of the 1800s. There is reason to believe that this well documented phenomenon of the past, with sufficient volcanic activity, could recur on the meso and large scale; with present day activity the emissions continue to cause damage to vegetation, both in the Aspromonte mountains (Calabria, Southern Italy) as well as in other parts of Italy.

AB Risk factors predicting deterioration to diabetes mellitus were examined in 181 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance. Fifty-seven subjects had impaired glucose tolerance on one occasion followed by normal glucose tolerance at a repeat oral glucose tolerance test, and 124 subjects had impaired glucose tolerance on two successive oral glucose tolerance tests. Subjects were followed for a median period of 5.0 years (range 1.0-17.2). The age- and sex-adjusted cumulative incidence of diabetes at 10 years of follow-up was higher in subjects who had impaired glucose tolerance on both tests (70%) than in those whose glucose tolerance was normal at the repeat test (53%), [rate ratio (RR) = 1.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.0-2.5]. Proportional hazards analyses were used to identify baseline risk factors (measured at the repeat oral glucose tolerance test) for subsequent diabetes, and incidence rate ratios were calculated for the 90th percentile compared with the 10th percentile of each continuous variable for the whole group. In all subjects, in separate models, higher body mass index [RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 2.2-9.9], high fasting serum insulin concentrations [RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-4.2], and low early insulin response [RR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.8] 30 min after a glucose load were significant predictors for deterioration to diabetes. In a multivariate analysis which controlled for age and sex, 120-min post-load glucose, fasting insulin and late insulin response predicted diabetes. In subgroup analyses the predictors of diabetes were generally similar in subjects who had impaired glucose tolerance at only one test and those who had impaired glucose tolerance on both tests. These findings suggest that in those subjects with impaired glucose tolerance whose glucose tolerance has returned to normal, the risk of subsequent diabetes is high. Insulin resistance, impaired early insulin response, or both, are predictive of subsequent development of diabetes in Pima Indians with impaired glucose tolerance.

AB The continuous response variable controlled trial design is developed as a model for the efficient screening of candidate treatments in motor neuron disease. A TRH analogue (RX77368) and placebo were randomly allocated to 15 matched pairs of patients with motor neuron disease. With validated composite interval scores, this trial excluded a 50% or greater improvement with RX77368 at month 12 in scores of respiratory, lower limb, and activities of daily living function with greater than 90% power, and in bulbar function scores with 80% power. For upper limbs, 52% and 75% improvements were excluded at months 9 and 12 respectively with 80% power. Patients who died during the study had faster deterioration rates in bulbar and respiratory scores than their surviving pairs.
   The feasibility of screening drugs for significant biological effects with small sample sizes and good statistical power is shown. The difficulties of handling deaths and dropouts when using this design are discussed. Comparisons are made with sample sizes required using other scores and rating scales, as well as with those required in hazard and event rate studies. A simple clinical grading scale for motor neuron disease, with its corresponding composite interval scores, is described.

TI FAT INTAKES IN INDIA - AN UPDATE
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID ACIDS
AB New dietary data and information on the nature of the fats and fatty acids present in foodstuffs have been put together. National average visible fat consumption is about 13 g/head/d, made up of vegetable oil 79%, ghee 3% and vanaspati 18%, with distinct regional variations. Average rural diets carry about 21.5 g/CU/d (range 37.1 to 14.0 g) of invisible fat, about two-third of which is from cereals. In the southern states, fresh coconut and spices are both substantial contributors. The contribution of total fat (visible plus invisible) to dietary energy in rural diets averages 13.2 en%, and ranges for 13 stares from 19.9 to 7.7 en%; the poorest sections show a figure of 10 en%, and affluent groups in urban areas from 25 to 37 en%, exceeding sometimes the health risk figure of 30 en%. Of the two essential fatty acids, linoleic acid contributes an average of 3.32 en%, or 8.7 g/CU/d, to rural diets (of which 74% derives from invisible fat), and linolenic acid 0.38 en%, or 1.01 g/CU/d (of which 62% comes from invisible fat). The 1989 recommendations of the Indian Council for Medical Research, based on these considerations, prescribe for an adult male, e.g., 20 g/d of a fat containing 20% of linoleic acid. The desirable relative proportions of saturated, oleic and polyunsaturated fatty acids on current evidence are about 40:28:32, which Indian diets approach closely. A higher dietary intake of linolenic acid would serve to attain a better linoleic/linolenic acid ratio of about 8:1, and could be had by regular consumption bf more green leafy vegetables, of some rape-mustard oil, or of some fish. The presence in sesame, ricebran, and palm oils of powerful natural antioxidants favour their inclusion as cooking fats. Health risks could arise on several counts. The high erucic acid level in traditional mustard oils, suggests caution in their use till varieties low in this component are produced in India. Other hazards are posed by aflatoxins in unrefined groundnut oil, from argemone oil as a contaminant in other oils, ar;d through excessive consumption of trans-fatty acids by way of vanaspati. Newborn babies obtain from breast milk as much as 30 g of fat/d with a high content of varied polyunsaturated fatty acids. Weaning constitutes a distinct danger point in respect of both the quantity and quality of fat imbibed.

AB Objectives. This study characterized mortality in a group of Mexican children (n = 18, mean [+/-SD] age 9.9 +/- 3 years) with primary pulmonary hypertension and investigated the factors associated with their survival.
   Background. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a progressive, fatal disease of unknown cause. Establishing the diagnosis earlier in life may influence prognosis.
   Methods. A dynamic cohort of children with primary pulmonary hypertension were enrolled between December 1977 and May 1991 and followed up through September 1992. Measurements included hemodynamic and pulmonary function variables in addition to demographic data, medical history and response to vasodilator treatment. We also compared the survival estimates of these children with those of our adult patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 42, mean age 27.9 +/- 8.5 years).
   Results. Baseline mean (+/-SD) pulmonary artery pressure a-as similar in children and adults (66 +/- 15 vs. 65 +/- 18 mm Hg, p = NS), but a higher cardiac index resulted in a lower er mean pulmonary vascular resistance index in children (18 +/- 7 vs. 26 +/- 12 U/m(2), p < 0.01). The proportion of patients,rho had a positive hemodynamic response to vasodilator treatment was higher in children than in adults (41% vs. 25%). Estimated median survival in children was 4.12 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 8.66) and 3.12 years in adults (95% CI 0.5 to 13.25, chi-square log-rank 0.81, p = NS). Elevated right atrial pressure (rate ratio 10.2) and decreased stroke volume index irate ratio 32.9) were the only significant predictors of mortality (Col proportional hazards model).
   Conclusions. Children with primary pulmonary hypertension have a poor survival expectancy, which does not appear to differ from that in adults with primary pulmonary hypertension. Mortality in childhood primary pulmonary hypertension is also associated with variables that assess right ventricular dysfunction.

AB There are an estimated 1,500 natural gas facilities across Canada, most of which used mercury (Hg) in metering equipment at one time or another. Although the use of mercury has ceased, many gas industry buildings still contain detectable levels of Hg in air. Air Hg levels are generally low but indoor remediation is suggested. Worker exposure to the air Hg levels is not considered a significant hazard. Very high soil Hg levels have been observed at numerous sites. Soil Hg levels do not pose an immediate human hazard but are sufficient to be hazardous to ecological receptors. The area of soil contamination is generally within the buildings or within a few metres of the nearest door. Downward movement of the Hg does not generally extend more than one metre. Remediation of contaminated soil with on-site thermal desorption is recommended as the appropriate soil clean-up technology.

TI An unstable mountain catchment in the northern Alps: Geomorphological

AB A 4-year-long research programme has adressed the geomorphological factors and processes acting in a small catchment in order to assess future streamflood and debris-flow hazards (L'Eglise, 5 km(2), 2500-770 m a.s.l.), in Tarentaise, the northern Alps. The nearby watershed (La Ravoire, Bourg St. Maurice) was badly eroded on March 31-April 1, 1981, when mudflows and debris flows swept down the channel and adjacent slopes and removed about 300 000 m(3) of debris. This study analyses the factors which render the slopes unstable, and the channel able to carry small to large debris flows. We identify 5 morpho-climatic factors and 4 geologic-hydrological factors which may trigger debris flows in a steep mountain catchment. Such severe events are medium- to large-sized (about 0.1 to 1 x 10(6) m(3)), and not very frequent in the Tarentaise valley (4 to 5 streamfloods, but only I or 2 debris flows per century). Conclusions are drawn from comparisons between the geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of similar mountain catchments, and debris flows in the northern Alps.

SO EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Tatras Biosphere Reserve the surface is threatened by water erosion processes as well as snow avalanches and debris flows, scarcely also by other mass movements particularly due to powerful relief energy.
   By a catastrophic erosion due to surface runoff 0.6 % and by a very strong erosion 73.6 % of area of both the core and buffer zones of the Biosphere Reserve are threatened. The average rate of potential soil losses is up to 8.09 mm per annum there.
   The area affected by snow avalanches ranges at altitudes from 1300 to 2600 m a.s.l. and amounts to 8557 ha. The number of avalanche tracks is 1042 (29.7 % of them are avalanches which have occurred very often and 33.8 % of avalanches are regularly occurring). Nearly 49 % of all avalanche tracks are running down into a montane belt.
   In the Tatras Mts 830 tracks of debris flows (with an enormous destructive power) have occurred. Length of 51 % of the tracks amounts to 500-1000 m. A trigger - point of 65 % debris flows in situated above 1900 m a.s.l. whereby the flows are running down below 1400 m a.s.l.

TI NUTRIENT-LOSS TRENDS FOR VEGETABLE AND CITRUS FIELDS IN WEST-CENTRAL
   FLORIDA .2. PHOSPHATE
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Vegetable and citrus production in west-central Florida has come under suspicion as a hazard (with respect to NO3-N and ortho-P) to local groundwater and surface-water bodies, including a 33 000-ha drinking-water supply reservoir near Bradenton in Manatee County. Using a combination of multilevel samplers in the shallow (surficial) aquifer beneath selected vegetable fields and citrus groves, coupled with piezometric wells around each field's periphery to assess depth-integrated solute concentrations and direction and rate of groundwater flow, ortho-P levels have been assessed at 10 sites for three vegetable-production seasons during 1990 and 1998. Some ortho-P movement from vegetable production beds to surface waters and shallow groundwater appears likely, but ortho-P concentrations also are elevated at a native range site that has not received P fertilizers, and in both man-made and natural surface-water retention ponds plus nearby intermittent streams throughout the area. Naturally occurring phosphatic clays appear to be introducing considerable P into local shallow groundwater and associated surface-water bodies. Regulatory strategies requiring sizeable retention ponds for tailwater-return flow capture may be contributing to P loadings of the surface water, whenever pond construction intercepts phosphatic clay materials.

TI NATIONAL WIND HAZARDS REDUCTION PROGRAM
SO JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE

DT Article
AB Recent events such as Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki have shown that wind-related disasters occur in the United States with consequences much more far-reaching and severe than expected.  During this International Decade for Natural Disaster Mitigation, (1991-2000), the U.S. wind engineering community is calling for the establishment of a wind hazards reduction program analogous in function to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.  This proposed wind hazards program would provide badly needed leadership in improving our understanding of wind-induced structural behavior, in improving codes of practice, in providing advanced methods for evaluating and predicting wind loadings, and in providing an impetus to structural engineers to develop new technologies for improving structural performance.  In the present paper, the need for such a program is discussed, and its organization and goals are outlined.

AB The time to failure of an item is observed under a high stress, and the estimates are needed for the normal stress levels.  This paper is concerned with empirical Bayes estimation of one of the two shape parameters (k) and the reliability function R(t) of the Burr type XII failure model based on type-2 censored data obtained from an accelerated life test.  It is assumed that the effect of acceleration is to scale up the hazard rate, and that the parameter k has the natural conjugate prior with a known mean and unknown variance.  Computations show good performance of the empirical Bayes estimators as compared with the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators.

AB Specimen life statistics are presented from an accelerated field simulator (AFS) study of the natural durability of the heartwood of 66 timber species. Replicate stakes were exposed in three tanks. The first tank offered only a decay hazard, while the others offered either 20 weeks of decay or two weeks of decay followed by exposure to the termites from a mound colony of Coptotermes lacteus Froggatt). The exposure period with termites lasted approximately 2.5 years, while the other (only decay) lasted approximately twice as long. The decay test resulted in extensive white rot of the out-of-ground portion of stakes. The high correlation between median specimen life (MEDSL) values of timbers in the decay study compared to a previous AFS decay test in different soil suggests that the difference in soil type had no significant effect on the order of unserviceability of the timber species. The high correlation between MEDSL values from stakes exposed to termites after a short (2 weeks) or long (20 weeks) predecay period suggests that the longer predecay period was not necessary to accurately determine the order of termite resistance of the timbers. However, for this large group of diverse timber species, there is only a weak relationship between decay resistance and termite resistance. The latter finding clearly justifies the inclusion of a termite hazard in these AFS determinations of natural durability. Further discussion emphasises the need to include results on the variability of performance.

AB The nature-society system is proposed as the relevant analytical unit for the sociological study of disasters. Like other complex systems, this system has emergent properties: its instabilities are the disasters. They often arise as a result of adoption by a community of specific technologies, e.g., housing technologies, that turn out to be unstable in the presence of critical natural or social changes. The following earthquake disasters were caused by unplanned and unforeseen features of housing or siting technologies: Huaxian 1556 (caves in loess), Yungay 1970 (siting in the path of an avalanche), and Mexico 1985 (high-rise buildings on soft ground). Disasters have an archaeology, in the sense that the instabilities in the nature-society system are not static. This is demonstrated by tracing the 1985 Mexico earthquake disaster back to decisions on urban planning taken after 1521. It is not enough to know the hazard and the vulnerability in order to understand disasters. Technological solutions also have a local history.

AB The applicability of aerospace technology varies with the kind of hazard. Some are limited in extent and require high resolution images while for others low resolution satellite data are appropriate. The magnitude of a disaster caused by high-intensity low-frequency natural events depends on the susceptibility (S) of the land and the vulnerability (V) of the society. Risk R = fS.fV.
   Aerospace data give the spatial extent of disasters and thus serve in emergency operations. Data acquisition then is time-critical; high temporal resolution and all weather capability are essential. More important is the use for disaster preparedness. The imagery needed then is not time critical and other capabilities (spatial/spectral resolution, 3D info, etc.) determine the selection of sensors. The survey should result in hazard zoning to guide physical planning and in monitoring to issue early warnings.

ID RADAR INTERFEROMETRY
AB The power of SAR interferometry in earthquake monitoring has been demonstrated with the Landers earthquake, where the movement of coseismic features have been measured with a typical precision of 2 to 10 millimetre over a 35000 km(2) area surrounding the event.
   The basic results of this technique and its limitations will be discussed and the results obtained on various sites representing various applications will be shown. These sites include the Landers site which has been monitored from April 92 to August 93. The technique may also contribute to significant advances in flood prediction by creating elevation map of flat areas with a precision better than one meter. Our method of digital elevation model elimination greatly enhances the quality of the results.
   Some of the limitations of the radar data used so far are now well understood. We may therefore outline the technical features of a radar satellite devoted to Earth crustal motion survey, This satellite would bring a revolution in the monitoring and assessment of natural hazards by allowing a high rate survey of the global land cover with a precision which could ultimately be on the order of a few millimetres.

AB Mankind and nature is threatened by a significant number of natural disasters every year. Early detection of hazards and time effective disaster monitoring is necessary. Remote sensing satellites can provide valuable inputs on disaster management both for an accurate prediction and for a rapid assessment of the location and extent of damage. Currently, several remote sensing satellites are orbiting the Earth, collecting large amount of data. Characteristic parameters of spaceborne remote sensing are spectral coverage, spectral resolution, revisit time and spatial resolution. The analysis of currently operating spaceborne infrastructure makes evident that it covers global aspects of environmental monitoring excellently but is not well suited for disaster mitigation /1/. This is mainly due to a low repitition in time and a relatively bad spatial resolution. For disaster monitoring a growing demand for observations with high repetition rates between 1/2 - 1 hour and 7 days and medium to high resolution in time between 10 m and 1 lan is evident. Constellations of small satellites can close the gap, left by the existing systems, in a cost-effective manner. Small satellites are characterized by low volume, a mass limited to 250 - 400 kg and a power consumption below 350 W. A design to cost is achieved by using subsystem components which are commercially onhand. Indicative are the short development time and the numerous launch possibilities, making small satellites highly attractive for constellations. Different constellations with 4 to 32 satellites were investigated. Main focus was given to constellations using sunsynchronous orbits. It will be inferred that a resolution in time of about 1/2 hour can be achieved by a system comprising 32 satellites.

AB Frost is a natural hazard, which may cause significant damage to agriculture depending also on the phenological stage of the affected crops. In this paper, several features of the frost-affected areas are examined by using digital data of METEOSAT IR images. In particular the areal extent of frost is delineated by using the estimated temperature from the raw satellite data. Moreover, since digital METEOSAT IR images are recorded every thirty (30) minutes, it is possible to monitor the changes in the size of the frost-affected areas as well as the fluctuations in frost intensity and severity. The phenomenon is investigated in several regions in Greece.

AB The Great Lakes shoreline in Ontario is subject to severe flooding and erosion due to frequent high water level periods and storm events leading to wind and wave action. After extensive property damages in 1985 and 1986, the province established a shoreline management program to be administered by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. A key component of this program is the development of Great Lakes shoreline management plans by Ontario conservation authorities. A review of three such plans reveals a focus on understanding the range and frequency of shoreline flooding and erosion, and the use of land use regulations and shoreline protection structures to reduce the impact from these hazards. Limited attention and responses are provided for the range of issues and concerns that occur in these shoreline areas such as ecosystem management, species and habitat protection, and water quality. A lack of consistency, enforcement, monitoring and coordination occurs in the provincial program which has also recently been affected by related land use and environmental planning initiatives and government financial restraints.

AB Today, clay mineral sealings are often used for the construction of new waste disposal sites in order to protect the ground water from contamination by hazard seepage waters.  In 1977 one part of the newly constructed waste disposal site in Geldern-Pont near Monchengladbach, western Germany was reserved in order to investigate the long-term stability of such sealings.  After 8 years, the clay sealing of the dump, filled only with conventional domestic waste, was sampled in order to study its geochemical alteration.  In the present study a core of the clay liner was investigated using conventional organic geochemial methods.  Results showed that the upper half of the 46 cm thick sealing has accumulated abundant organic matter.  The extractable part is primarily composed of long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and polar compounds.  The dominant constituents are odd-numbered n-alkan-2-ones and even-numbered n-alkanols associated with minor amounts of long-chain odd-numbered n-alkan-2-ones and even-numbered n-aldehydes.  The composition is similar to that of natural waxes of higher plants.  Aromatic compounds, present in the original clay, disappeared from the sealing as shown by quantitation of phthalic acid esters, linear alkylbenzenes and phenanthrenes.  Several parameters indicate that the activity of anaerobic microorganisms, in the dump and in the upper part of the sealing, governed the geochemical composition observed after 8 years.  Aliphatic constituents resisted biodegradation and replaced the aromatic compounds present in the interlayer space of silicate layers.
