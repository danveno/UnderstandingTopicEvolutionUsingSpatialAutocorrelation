TI ESTIMATES OF THE OCCUPATIONAL RADIOLOGICAL HAZARD IN THE PHOSPHATE
   FERTILIZERS INDUSTRY IN POLAND
SO RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The radiological hazard for workers in the phosphate fertilisers industry was assessed based on measurements in five phosphate plants in Poland. Measurement of absorbed dose rates in air, gamma doses, radon gas concentrations in air, and concentrations of natural radionuclides (U-238, Ra-226, Po-210, Th-232, and K-40) in samples of raw phosphate rocks, products and byproducts were performed using an ionisation chamber, thermoluminescent detectors, solid state nuclear track detectors, alpha and gamma spectrometry, respectively. Using models for dose estimates, individual occupational doses were evaluated for phosphate industry workers involved in the production of fertilisers. On average, the estimated dose for yearly exposure ranged from 2.8 to 5.6 mSv, with the biggest contribution typically coming from phosphate dust. This is a significant amount when compared with the value of the annual dose limit of 1 mSv for the public, but still well below the occupational dose limit of 50 mSv per year.

TI A NOTE ON DISTRIBUTION OF AMPLITUDES OF PEAKS IN STRUCTURAL RESPONSE
   INCLUDING UNCERTAINTIES OF THE EXCITING GROUND MOTION AND OF THE
   STRUCTURAL MODEL
SO SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB This note is an extension of earlier works that presented probability distribution functions for amplitudes of the peaks (the highest, the second highest... the m-th highest) in response of deterministic single degree-of-freedom (SDOF) and multi degree-of-freedom (MDOF) structures to ground motion, with deterministic Fourier spectrum and duration. It shows how these probability distribution functions can be evaluated if the Fourier spectrum and duration of the excitation are random variables specified via distribution functions. Two cases are considered: (1) when the structural model is deterministic, and (2) when the modal frequencies are random variables. The procedure presented here approximates the transfer function of the structural response by Dirac delta functions at the modal frequencies, and is applicable to multi-storey buildings with small modal damping, and with natural frequencies that are not too close. The resulting probability distribution functions are needed in seismic hazard calculations of peak response amplitudes of SDOF and MDOF structures that will not be exceeded with given confidence during the service time of the structure from any earthquake at all known faults within certain distance from the structure.

AB Managing the hazards from orbital debris is fundamentally an issue of managing the residual energy associated with operations in space. Access to and operations in space require a large expenditure of energy. Current objects placed into orbit contain a large amount of residual energy. This energy can include stored energy in the form of unburned propellant, batteries, or pressurized containers, but always includes an even larger amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy. The importance of this residual energy is that it is the energy source for re-distributing the kinetic energy into various debris sizes. The only natural ''sink'' for the residual energy is atmospheric drag, which is more fundamentally expressed as an energy loss rate.
   By approaching orbital debris as an energy management rather than object management problem, some of the fundamental issues concerning orbital debris become more obvious. For example, the amount of kinetic energy in orbit far exceeds the amount of stored energy; consequently any long-term debris management strategy must consider managing kinetic energy. These principles can be applied to both low Earth orbit and Geosynchronous orbit and illustrate the need for different strategies in these two regions.

TI MERCURY IN NATURAL-GAS
SO VISION TECNOLOGICA
LA English
DT Article
ID GOLD
AB Metallic mercury as well as ils organic and inorganic compounds, have long been known to exist as trace components in many natural gas streams. Besides its corrosive effect mercury has also been said to be a highly toxic element and it is therefore not desirable a by-product in the hydrocarbon industry since it could eventually result in pollution of soil, air and water. Also, the gas industry has realized the potential exposure hazard to which crew men, who handle raw natural gas, co-produced liquids, and plant wastes, are subjected during production, processing and maintenance field operations. This paper presents a review of the occurrence, analysis measurement, and removal of mercury in natural gas flows, as well as some aspects concerning the; environmental impact mercury might cause. Measurement and speciation information of mercury in natural gas streams is very important for proper gas plant design, maintenance, and continuous improvements of clean-up processes.

AB Reclaimed lakes (surface greater than or equal to 3 m below sea level) in a coastal plain with formerly more or less stagnant flow conditions, act as huge groundwater discharge areas and convert the bordering land into groundwater recharge zones. The main consequences are: (1) the infiltration of fresh polder and river-Rhine water, both of poor quality; (2) the moving in of fresh groundwater of excellent quality, from relatively remote sandy recharge areas like the coastal dunes and Pleistocene uplands; (3) the encroachment of salt North Sea water along the west coast; and (4) the bleeding-out of relict brackish to salt water.
   The sluggish change in the spatial distribution of water types, leads to new possibilities of groundwater pumping for public water supply in and around the deep polders, in future. The chemical consequences are discussed. Salinization hazards for well fields in the coastal dunes and Pleistocene uplands may increase.

AB Objective-To compare the progression of HIV-1 infection in men and women followed up for up to nine years after an accurately estimated date of seroconversion.
   Design-Prospective observational study.
   Setting-16 HIV outpatient clinics across Italy.
   Subjects-321 women and 533 men infected with HIV through injecting drug use or heterosexual sex and with accurately estimated dates of seroconversion.
   Main outcome measures-Progression to severe CD4 lymphocytopenia (CD4 lymphocyte count < 200 x 10(6)/1), development of AIDS defining diseases, and death from AIDS.
   Results-Thirty two women and 67 men developed AIDS at Kaplan-Meier progression rates of 25% (95% confidence interval 13.8% to 35.5%) and 23% (15.6% to 30.4%), respectively, 7 years after seroconversion. In a Cox proportional hazards model the relative hazard was 0.93 (that is, a slightly lower hazard in women) before and 1.10 (0.70 to 1.72) after adjusting for age, HIV exposure group, and year of seroconversion. When CD4 lymphocytopenia and death from AIDS were used as end points the results were similar, with adjusted relative hazards of 0.95 (0.63 to 1.42) and 0.72 (0.48 to 1.79) respectively. In both women and men the risk of developing AIDS before the CD4 lymphocyte count had declined below 200 x 10(6)/1 was small (3% in women, 6% in men). The estimated median count at which AIDS developed in women (34 x 10(6)/1; 10 x 10(6) to 44 x 10(6)) was similar to that for men (44 x 10(6)/1; 22 x 10(6) to 60 x 10(6)).
   Conclusion-There seems to be little evidence for appreciable differences in the natural course of HIV infection between men and women followed up from the time of seroconversion.

AB Background This study describes the impact of clinical, angiographic, and demographic characteristics on the longterm survival of Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) patients while they were under medical treatment. Revascularization rates for the population are also provided.
   Methods and Results All CASS patients who had not received heart surgery before enrollment (23 467 patients) were included in this survival analysis while they were under medical treatment or surveillance. Follow-up time ranged from 0 to 17 years (median, 12 years). Long-term vital status is known for 95.8% of these patients. Log-rank tests, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox proportional-hazards regression are used to describe and assess the impact of patient characteristics on survival. Characteristics that had a significant impact on survival, in order of observed explanatory power, are age, number of diseased vessels, congestive heart failure score, smoking history, ejection fraction, sex, presence of left main coronary artery disease, presence of diabetes, left ventricular wall motion score, presence of other illnesses, history of myocardial infarction, and presence of left main equivalent disease. Overall, 12-year survival for patients with zero-, one-, two-, and three-vessel disease is 88%; 74%, 59%, and 40%, respectively. Twelve-year survival for patients with at least one diseased vessel and ejection fractions in the ranges of 50% to 100%, 35% to 49%, and 0% to 34% is 73%, 54%, and 21%, respectively. High myocardial jeopardy, high anginal class, and two or three proximal diseased vessels characterize the profile of patients most likely to have received surgical treatment during follow-up.
   Conclusions These results contribute to the understanding of the natural history of coronary artery disease and are also of historical interest: The poor survival of patients with three-vessel disease and low ejection fractions continues to emphasize the importance of considering revascularization for these patients.

AB Latex allergy is an occupational hazard for health care workers. Extractable latex proteins are known to be allergenic, but most latex allergens have not been specifically identified. The purpose of this study was to characterize the IgE response of latex-allergic patients to latex proteins and to identify common protein allergens. Serum was obtained from 40 individuals who were skin test-positive to latex; 85% were health care workers. Western blots for IgE reactivity were performed using both ammoniated (AL) and non-ammoniated (NAL) latex proteins and IgE-reactive NAL proteins were analysed by microsequence analysis. The patients were grouped according to common patterns of reactivity. Pattern 1, the most common pattern of reactivity (9/40 patients) recognized two protein bands in both NAL and AL at 46 and 110kD. A second, heterogeneous pattern of reactivity (pattern 2) recognized a diffuse pattern of polypeptides in the AL preparation. The n-terminal amino acid sequences for allergens at 14, 18, 29, 46 and 110kD were determined. Sequence analysis identified the 14-kD and 18-kD allergens as the hevein preprotein. The 46-kD and 110-kD had identical sequences which were unique from known latex proteins. We conclude that multiple latex proteins are allergens with hevein preprotein and a previously unidentified 46/110-kD protein being commonly recognized in health care workers.

TI FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARDS - RECENT LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTS TO ASSESS

LA English

ID NATURAL-GAS FLARES; RADIATIVE CHARACTERISTICS; SIZE
AB British Gas has always adopted high engineering standards to ensure the safety of gas production, storage and supply systems and a significant proportion of the annual research budget is associated with projects which have safety implications. However, despite the emphasis on good design, maintenance and operating practices, there always remains a small probability that an accidental release of a flammable material could occur. It is therefore important to be able to demonstrate that the combination of failure probability and the resulting consequences does not give rise to an unacceptable level of risk.
   In order to define accurately the likely consequences of such a release, British Gas is supporting an experimental research programme which considers dispersion, fire and explosion related issues, as part of a wide range of safety related research activities. This work has enabled both a proper understanding and definition of the hazards involved in gas industry operations to be obtained, together in appropriate cases, with the assessment of practical measures which can be employed to mitigate, or eliminate, such hazards.
   In 1990, a paper which summarised the research undertaken by British Gas Research and Technology (R&T) to assess and mitigate the consequences of gas release, was presented to the Midlands Section of the Institution of Gas Engineers (1). This current paper provides an overview of the large scale experimental research on hazardous releases, which has been carried out since that time in support of the British Gas safety related research programme.

AB Experimental results are reported on four types of freshwater model ecosystem after administration of a single dose of chlorpyrifos. The fate, and primary and secondary effects of chlorpyrifos were compared between the model ecosystems, and were evaluated in the light of the predictive value of the current ecotoxicological hazard assessment procedure for pesticides, `Slootbox', a fate model used in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of pesticides in the Netherlands, overestimated chlorpyrifos concentrations, The primary effects of chlorpyrifos can be predicted accurately on the basis of single species laboratory toxicity data. The population effects observed in the microecosystems, microcosms, and mesocosms were consistent between all experiments and with the single species tests, Community metabolism, as a functional endpoint, was less sensitive than the structural parameters measured, Secondary effects, both for structural and functional endpoints, varied between the micro- and mesocosm experiments. At the present 'state of the art' in ecotoxicology, no a priori prediction of secondary effects in natural ecosystems will generally be possible. 0.1 times the lowest acute L(E)C-50 for chlorpyrifos, as measured in the current ecotoxicological hazard assessment procedure, matched the NOEC(mesocosm) for a single dose of chlorpyrifos, Recovery of populations affected by insecticide stress was found to depend on factors such as life cycle characteristics and ecological infrastructure, in addition to the toxicant concentration. The onset of (potential) recovery is likely to start at an approximate concentration of the EC(10)(48 h).

AB To expand the scope of natural resource values included in USDA Forest Service fire management analysis system, a mail survey of Oregon households regarding their willingness to pay for a fire prevention and control program on northern spotted owl critical habitat units in Oregon was performed. Using the voter referendum format, annual willingness to pay of $77 per Oregon household was estimated. This translates into a value of $28 per acre protected. The contingent valuation method may provide a promising avenue for incorporating society's broadening concern about biodiversity and natural values into public land management agencies fire management decisions.

AB The objective was to document the 5 year prognosis of patients who had cardiac complications after non-cardiac surgery. Design: 5-year follow-up of 218 patients originally enrolled in a prospective study to identify risks factors for perioperative complications. Setting: an academic medical center. Participants were hypertensives and diabetics who underwent elective surgery between 1982 and 1985. In the original study, patients were evaluated pre-operatively, monitored intra-operatively by an independent observer, and followed daily for 7 days post-operatively according to a standard surveillance protocol. Outcomes were judged by assessors blinded to the pre-operative status and intra-operative course. Patients were interviewed at 3 and 5 years post-operatively. Patients with post-operative cardiac complications had significantly higher rates of overall mortality, mortality attributable to cardiac causes (MI, CHF, arrest), and mortality attributable to other cardiovascular causes (stroke, renal failure) than patients without cardiac complications. For example, at 5 years 11% of those patients without post-operative cardiac complications had cardiac deaths, in contrast to 45% of those patients with post-operative cardiac complications. Proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that post-operative cardiac complications remained a significant predictor of cardiac (p < 0.001) and cardiovascular (p < 0.0001) mortality controlling for pre-operative cardiac disease, other non-cardiovascular comorbid diseases, age, sex, diabetes, and pre-operative renal insufficiency or stroke. Similarly, patients with post-operative non-fatal cardiac complications had higher rates of cardiac or cardiovascular events during the 5 year follow-up period. We conclude that post-operative cardiac complications have a significant adverse long-term prognostic impact comparable to the prognostic impact of myocardial infarction, ischemia or congestive failure in the non-operative setting. Understanding these events could be an important factor in identifying patients at high risk for subsequent peri-operative complications.

AB The theory of wavelets is a developing branch of mathematics with a wide range of potential applications. Compactly supported wavelets are particularly interesting because of their natural ability to represent data with intrinsically local properties. They are useful for the detection of edges and singularities in image and sound analysis and for data compression. But most of the wavelet-based procedures currently available do not explicitly account for the presence of noise in the data. A discussion of how this can be done in the setting of some simple nonparametric curve estimation problems is given. Wavelet analogies of some familiar kernel and orthogonal series estimators are introduced, and their finite sample and asymptotic properties are studied. We discover that there is a fundamental instability in the asymptotic variance of wavelet estimators caused by the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet transform. This is related to the properties of certain lacunary sequences. The practical consequences of this instability are assessed.

AB The effect of pH in the range 5.2-6.7 on the thermal destruction of Clostridium sporogenes PA3679 spores suspended in mushrooms in brine acidified with citric acid was examined by the 'inoculated pack test' method. The results indicated that increasing acidity is accompanied by decreasing decimal reduction times at 121.1 degrees C: D-121.1 at pH 6.0 and 5.2 was, respectively, 64% and 17.5% of that at pH 6.7, the pH of natural mushrooms (D-121.1 = 2.22 min). A linear model (r = 0.988, alpha = 0.05) was developed where the D-121.1 value was a function of the pH over the range studied. The inoculated pack test seems to be the only method to evaluate the actual microbial heat resistance, whether of spore or of vegetative forms, in order to estimate within reasonably close limits a suitable process time required to eliminate health hazards and to prevent spoilage losses in a given food product.

LA English
DT Article
AB The fission track technique has been used to estimate the U concentrations in water samples collected from the Hamirpur, Una, Bilaspur and Kangra districts of Himachal Pradesh, India.  The sources comprise wells, springs, a municipal supply (tap water) and drains.  The smallest U concentration of 0.006 +/- 0.01 ppb has been found in the spring water of Palampur city and the highest concentration 20.94 +/- 0.14 ppb was in the drain water of Samurkalan village.  A comparison of the U concentrations in nearby sources, and the time variation in a particular source, have been assessed.  The dissolved Rn-222 content in some of these sources has also been estimated in situ by radom emanometery.  The risk of health hazard due to ingestion of the dissolved radon has been assessed.  The problem of optimization of the thermal neutron dose in order to obtain a countable track density for experimental purposes is discussed.

AB Creosote, a distillation product of coal tar, is made up of an extremely complex mixture of phenols and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) which include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen (NSO) containing heterocyclics. It is considered to be an environmental hazard. This report presents some preliminary results from a large field experiment that is evaluating the mobility, persistence and fate in groundwater of compounds present in coal tar creosote. This involved setting up a long-term field experiment where a limited plume of contaminated ground water was created by placing creosote into an extremely well characterized sand aquifer. The original creosote was dominated by PAH components with minor amounts of NSO containing PAC. The concentration of the dominant nitrogen heterocyclic (quinoline) was only 10% of the abundance of the major PAH components (naphthalene and phenanthrene). Analysis of groundwater samples collected 278 days after the emplacement of the creosote shows that with increasing distance from the source the concentration of naphthalene is reduced while that of quinoline increases, eventually becoming dominant. A similar trend was also observed for samples collected after 471 days and this can be related to the relative aqueous solubilities and mobility of the two compounds. Also observed in the outermost 471 day samples was the presence of quinolinone which is believed to be an aerobic metabolite of quinoline. Strategies for the final parr of the project which involve cleaning up the Borden experimental site are briefly discussed in light of these results.

Progression free survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed according to the Cox proportional hazards model. During the observation period 16 patients (31%) experienced progression. Tumor volume, grade and seminal vesicle invasion emerged as statistically significant predictors of tumor progression in the survival analyses while age at surgery, preoperative stage and different levels of capsular penetration were not statistically significant. The findings in the Cox models were in accordance with those at actuarial survival analyses though tumor volume was the only variable proven to have an independent statistically significant influence on progression.

AB Background. Great progress in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has led to an increased number of resectable cases. Much attention has been paid to the factors affecting long term survival of patients with HCC after partial hepatectomy.
   Methods. Survival rates for approximately 5800 patients with HCC registered by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan who received partial hepatic resection from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 1989 were calculated relative to 14 clinicopathologic variables. Cox's multivariate analysis and the stepwise method then were performed to determine significant prognostic variables and to investigate the appropriate combination of these variables for predicting prognosis.
   Results. The use of Cox's multivariate proportional hazard model indicated that significant prognostic indicators were alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor size, number of tumors, accompanying cirrhosis, age, surgical curability, and portal involvement. The stepwise method showed that the most valuable prognostic factor was portal involvement, followed by number of tumors, alphafetoprotein level, tumor size, accompanying cirrhosis, age, and surgical curability. Furthermore, it was found that the best predictive combination of two factors was number of tumors and alpha-fetoprotein level and that the best predictive combination of three factors was the alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor size, and number of tumors.
   Conclusion. This extensive analysis provides information that can be used to predict the prognosis of patients with HCC after undergoing partial hepatectomy.

AB Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a natural platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist, BN 52021 (Ginkgolide B), in the treatment of patients with sepsis syndrome.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III, multicenter clinical trial.
   Setting: Twenty-one academic medical center intensive care units in France.
   Patients: Two hundred sixty-two patients with sepsis syndrome who received standard supportive care and antimicrobial therapy, in addition to the administration of platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist or placebo.
   Interventions: Patients received either a 120-mg dose of platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist intravenously every 12 hrs over a 4-day period or placebo.
   Main Outcome Measurements: All patients were evaluated for 28-day, all-cause mortality.
   Results: The 28-day mortality rate was 51% for the placebo group and 42% for the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist group (p = .17). However, the efficacy of platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist was significantly greater in patients with Gram-negative sepsis (test for interaction, p = .03). In a separate analysis of patients with and without Gram-negative sepsis, the 28-day mortality rate was 57% for the patients receiving placebo (30 deaths of 53 patients) and 33% for patients receiving platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (22 deaths of 67 patients; p = .01). Platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist also significantly (p = .01) reduced the mortality rate among pa. tients with Gram-negative sepsis who were in shock at entry into the study (mortality rate was 65% for placebo vs. 37% for platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist) and among pa. tients > 60 yrs of age (mortality rate was 74% for placebo vs. 31% for platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist). A Cox proportional-hazards model identified five independent prognostic factors: a) adequacy of antibiotic therapy; b) severity of illness; c) renal failure; d) hematologic failure; and e) hepatic failure at study entry. When the Gram-negative sepsis population was stratified by age and these five prognostic factors were controlled for, the relative risk of death of the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist group was 0.61 (0.34 to 1.08, 95% confidence interval; p = .09). This risk corresponds with an adjusted reduction in mortality rate of 39% for patients receiving platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist. No differences in mortality rates were found between the placebo and the platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist groups in the absence of Gram-negative sepsis. There were no differences in adverse events between the placebo and the treated groups.
   Conclusion: The studied platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021) seems to be a safe and promising treatment for patients with severe Gram-negative sepsis.

TI HYDRAULIC AND DRAINAGE PROPERTIES OF ENTISOLS AND INCEPTISOLS
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB A study was conducted during 1989-92 to evaluate the hydraulic and drainage characteristics of the soils of right-bank canal-command area of Mahi river in Gujarat.  The soils of the command comprise Vertic Halaquept, Typic Halaquept, Typic Ustochrept, Fluventic Ustochrept, Vertic Ustochrept, Typic Ustorthent and Fluventic Ustorthents.  The soils varied widely in their hydraulic and drainage properties.  The highest saturated hydraulic conductivity (36.4 cm/day) was found in Typic Ustorthents and lowest (2.2 cm/day) in Vertic Halaquept.  Critical water-table depth, when the upward flux was reduced to 0.1 cm/day, was 142, 164, 204, 178, 162, 124 and 150 cm respectively in Vertic Halaquept, Typic Halaquept, Typic Ustochrept, Fluventic Ustochrept, Vertic Ustochrept, Typic Ustorthent and Fluventic Ustorthent under bare soil condition.  The salinity hazards were in the order:  Typic Ustochrept < Fluventic Ustochrept < Vertic Ustochrept < Typic Halaquept < Fluventic Ustorthent < Vertic Halaquept and < Typic Ustorthent.  The chances of salinization were more in medium-textured soils than in fine- and coarse-textured ones.  The highest maximum drainable porosity (0.117 cm3/cm3) was observed in Typic Ustorthent and lowest (0.070 cm3/cm3) in Vertic Halaquept.  Under natural condition of drainage, Typic Ustorthent and Fluventic Ustorthent gave more water per unit fall of water-table, followed by Typic Ustochrept and Fluventic Ustochrept; whereas Vertic Halaquept, Typic Halaquept and Vertic Ustochrept gave less water.

TI MICROBIAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH EXFOLIATIVE DEVICES
SO MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural exfoliative devices such as plant and animal sponges support bacterial growth in the absence of any other food substrate. Inanimate devices such as synthetic sponges and pumice stones support bacterial growth after use when devitalized skin entrapped in the interstitial spaces of the device serves as a growth source. Exfoliative devices should be decontaminated with 10% hypochlorite bleach.

TI MOUNTAIN HAZARD GEOMORPHOLOGY OF TYROL AND VORARLBERG, AUSTRIA
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSLIDES; QUARTZ
AB This is a compound paper derived from the field guidebook prepared for the 1989 Salzburg Symposium on Mountain Hazard Geomorphology. It consists of seven separate parts, each prepared by one of the three co-authors. The first constitutes an introduction to the hazard geomorphology of the Tyrol and Vorarlberg, Austrian Alps. It provides outlines of the geology, tectonics, glacial history, topography, and present-day climate of the larger region within which the detailed field demonstrations of the excursion were set. Special attention is paid to the Otztal and its long history of natural disasters.
   The second part is a description of the Hall-Mils alluvial fan in the vicinity of Innsbruck. It provides a basis for understanding much of the Pleistocene and Holocene evolution of the Inn Valley terraces and alluvial fans, which are closely related to the development of the human settlements and the varying degree of hazard they sustain, depending upon their precise location.
   The details of the Enterbach torrent and alluvial fan are given the third section, with special attention to the 1969 debris flow disaster which destroyed 42 of the pre-existing 44 check-dams and caused US $1.8 million in damages to the village of Inzing and vicinity.
   Part four is an account of the giant landslide of Kofels that, about 8,700 years ago, collapsed into the Otztal between the sites of the present-day villages of Langenfeld and Umhausen. The earlier volcanic and meteorite impact hypotheses are reviewed and the current explanation of a giant landslide is presented. The force of the impact on the opposite valley wall was equivalent to a moderate-scale earthquake and the kinetic energy along the glide planes was sufficient to melt some of the underlying rock to create frictionite.
   The account of the 1987 Otztal flood disaster, as part five, demonstrates that mountain hazards remain a serious threat to this prime Alpine center of tourism and winter sports.
   Part six indicates that during the thirteenth, and seventeenth to nineteenth centuries the Otztal was even more hazardous than today. When the Gurgl and Vernagt glaciers extended to their historic maxima, ice-dammed lakes formed that periodically experienced catastrophic drainage and devastated the valley below them.
   The seventh and final article demonstrates how clear-cutting in the mountain forests of Schesa, near Bludenz, Voralberg, in the late-1770s, led to the development of an immense gully with recurrent disasters between the late-eighteenth century and the present.
   Taken together, these several parts combine studies in geology, geomorphology, and climatology, historical documentation, and the knowledge of the limited success of technical solutions, to demonstrate the complexity of mountain hazards research. They also demonstrate the need for caution, as well as sound legal basis, for human intervention in high energy mountain terrain.

AB Background. Relationships between tumor doubling time (DT) and other prognostic factors and the risk of death related to these factors are ndt yet fully understood.
   Methods. Tumor doubling time of primary lung carcinomas of 174 patients, detected in a limited number of local municipalities during a limited period, was calculated using the Schwartz formula. Survival rate of the 174 patients was compared with reference to categories of prognostic factors (univariate analyses) and significant factors affecting survival were identified by multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model.
   Results. Tumor doubling time had a log normal distribution. There was a significant difference in mean DT in relation to sex, smoking history, presence of symptoms, cell type, primary tumor factor, and stage. Univariate analyses showed a significant difference in survival in relation to DT, age, sex, method of tumor detection, smoking history, symptoms, therapy, cell type, primary tumor (T) factor, regional lymph node (N) factor, distant metastasis (M) factor, and stage. Multivariate analyses using the Cox's proportional hazard model in a stepwise fashion identified a final set of five significant variables: N factor (P = 0.0001); therapy (P = 0.0016); M factor (P = 0.0017); T factor (P = 0.0018), and DT (P = 0.0152).
   Conclusions. Tumor doubling time was an independent and significant prognostic factor for lung cancer patients.

AB Objective: To characterize the associations of age and progression rates to AIDS-defining neoplasms and opportunistic infections (OI) in HIV-infected homosexual men.
   Methods: Data from 407 homosexual men with documented dates of HIV seroconversion participating in cohort studies from four geographic locations were merged. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted with respect to the association of age with time from seroconversion to the first AIDS-defining neoplasm and OI.
   Results: Among the 307 participants, 139 (34%) were diagnosed with AIDS; 45 (11%) with neoplasms and 90 (22%) with OI. Older age at seroconversion was significantly associated with faster progression to neoplasms, but not to OI. For each 10-year increase in age the risk for neoplasms increased 1.65-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.43], after adjustment for clinical treatments. For OI this risk estimate was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.72-1.34).
   Conclusions: Increasing age is associated with faster progression to AIDS-defining neoplasms, but not with progression to OI. This has not been previously reported and may explain conflicting results in other studies among homosexual men that considered AIDS as a single entity. Our findings suggest that age and AIDS manifestations should be considered, particularly in the context of natural history studies, clinical trials and mathematical modelling.

TI RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF RISK-FACTORS FOR SPRUCE BEETLE OUTBREAKS
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE

LA English
DT Article
ID ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DECISION-MAKING
AB Nine factors were initially suggested by spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kby.)) experts in Alaska as potentially important in determining the risk of a spruce beetle outbreak in stands. Factors suggested were stand hazard, size and trend of spruce beetle population in neighboring stands, degree-days in the past June, total rainfall in the past summer, and availability of four types of breeding material. Risk factors were organized into a hierarchical model of spruce beetle risk, and the relative importance of factors for determining risk was analyzed in three stages with the analytic hierarchy process. This process derives subjective estimates of factor importance values through a process of pair-wise comparisons. Analysis in stage 1 involved independent responses of two experts from Alaska. In stage 2, three experts from Alaska provided responses as a group. In stage 3, five experts, representing Alaska, British Columbia, and the Rocky Mountain region, provided responses as a group. In the final stage of analysis, stand hazard and windthrown trees were identified as the two most important factors determining risk of a spruce beetle outbreak. Hazard and windthrow were considered about equally important and together accounted for almost two-thirds of the total allocation of importance values among risk factors. The analytic hierarchy process is an effective method for eliciting expert knowledge and can be a useful tool for development of expert systems in natural resource management, where even expert knowledge is often incomplete.

TI AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO HEALTH RISK - A CASE-STUDY OF URBAN ELDERLY
   HOMELESS PEOPLE
SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING
LA English
DT Article
ID OLDER
AB The purposes of this paper are:  to describe an ecological approach to assessing health risk, and to apply the approach to a sample of elderly homeless within the context of a single day in a single urban setting.  In the approach described, a method of progressive contextualization was used by adding different hazards to the risk profile in a single geographic area.  The various hazards were applied to the same time and space frame, that of a 24-hour period and in the urban space used by elderly homeless people.  Incorporated into the approach are the concepts of high-risk areas and space-time geography, and the theory of disease ecology.  The spatial-temporal distribution of resources, factors in the natural environment (patterns of daylight and dark and ambient temperature) and factors in the human-created environment (traffic and crime patterns) were identified as important hazards within the urban environment.  Homelessness itself, the effects of aging, the social milieu, and behavior patterns commonly seen in homeless people-particularly, alcohol abuse-were identified as important hazards for elderly homeless people.  Each hazard's spatial-temporal pattern within the 24-hour period is discussed.  Then the convergence of hazards forming an interactive effect is discussed.  Finally, approaches to nursing interventions aimed at reducing risk are presented.

   STEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS
AB New reagents and reactions for use in the chemistry of Natural Products can be invented and not just discovered by hazard.  First, we must recognize a reaction that would be important synthetically, but which does not yet exist in a satisfactory form.  Thus, the reaction proposed either does not exist, or if it does, is carried out under harsh conditions and is non-selective.  Poor yields, uneconomic reagents and lack of stereoselectivity are other factors that spur invention.  Thus, one has only to read the great syntheses of the day and ask for the yield, the conditions, the cost and the stereoselectivity at each step.  It is a rare academic synthesis that does not have a weak step.  It is even more unusual that new reagents or reactions are presented to alleviate the defects.  Some modest efforts to help will be presented.

AB Background and Purpose This study concerns the long-term prognosis of lacunar infarcts.
   Methods We report the analysis of our hospital-based series of 178 patients consecutively admitted for a lacunar syndrome due to a lacunar infarct diagnosed with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Demographic data, medical history, vascular risk factors, and imaging data were recorded for each patient. The follow-up was 35+/-22 months.
   Results The lacunar syndrome was pure motor hemiparesis in 69 patients (39%), ataxic hemiparesis in 45 patients (25.4%), pure sensory stroke in 15 patients (8.5%), sensorimotor stroke in 14 patients (7.9%), and miscellaneous syndrome in 34 patients (19.2%). The 4-year survival rate was 80+/-4% and the 4-year survival rate without recurrent stroke was 85+/-3.5%. Using Cox proportional-hazards analysis, the predictors of death were age (P<.02), diabetes mellitus (P<.05), and cigarette smoking (P<.05). We did not find any predictors of recurrence. After 1 year, 74% of the patients had mild or no disability. Using logistic regression analysis, the predictive factors of disability were age more than 70 years (P<.01), diabetes (P<.01), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (P<.05), and type of lacunar syndrome (P<.01). Imaging data, number of lacunes, and presence of leukoaraiosis were not predictors of outcome.
   Conclusions Our study suggests that with a high survival rate, a low recurrence rate, and a relatively good functional recovery, lacunar infarcts have a relatively favorable prognosis.

AB Objective: To examine survival differences in HIV-infected individuals between the sexes and the categories of transmission.
   Patients and setting: Subjects assumed to have been infected by injecting drug use, by male homosexual contact or by heterosexual contact and enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a national multicentre cohort study of adult HIV-infected patients.
   Methods: Kaplan-Meier lifetable and Cox regression analyses were performed (time 0 = date of study entry) and survivors were censored at their last follow-up visit.
   Results: A total of 4428 patients (mean duration of follow-up, 2.1 years) were considered. At entry, men were older and had lower CD4+ counts than women (P < 0.0001). Homosexual men were the oldest group with the lowest CD4+ counts and the most advanced disease at study entry (P < 0.0001). Crude hazard ratios indicated a 28% tower mortality from all causes in women compared with men (P < 0.0001) and, among men but not in women, a 28 and 32% higher mortality in homosexuals and heterosexuals compared with injecting drug users (IDU) (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.008, respectively). After adjusting for differences at entry, the mortality difference between the sexes disappeared (P = 0.5) and differences across transmission categories were reversed. Mortality in homosexual men was an estimated 13% (P = 0.057) lower than in male IDU; mortality was 22% lower in heterosexual women than in female IDU (P = 0.098). In stratified analysis the increased risk in IDU was confined to subjects with CD4+ cell counts > 500 x 10(6)/l cells at study entry.
   Conclusions: These results indicate a uniform mortality risk across the sexes but indicate an increased risk in IDU without CD4+ cell depletion at entry, the latter probably attributable to causes not related to progression of HIV infection. This study underscores the importance of adjusting for prognostic factors when comparing survival between different patient groups.

AB Cohorts of the epiphytic marine copepod Tisbe furcata were chronically exposed to copper in life-table experiments to test whether ecologically relevant impacts can occur at sublethal concentrations. Data on fecundity, longevity, and rate of development were used to calculate r(m) - the intrinsic rate of natural increase. Acute toxicity tests (96-h LC50 tests) were done to compare the concentrations of copper affecting individual lethality and population biology. The LC50 value for Tisbe furcata nauplii was 2.8 muM copper (178 mug/L). The results from the life-table experiments show that 0.9 muM copper (32% of LC50) can cause significant negative effects on demographic parameters (total production of nauplii, life span, and reproductive period for fertile females) and reduce the percentage of fertile females leading to a 61% reduction of r(m). However, r(m) was still positive at 0.9 muM copper, and the net reproductive rate (R(o)) indicated a fivefold increase in population size from one generation to the next. Although there were no significant effects of copper at 0.5 muM (18% of LC50), there was a negative trend in almost all the demographic parameters, indicating that the observed 10% reduction of r(m) at this concentration was an effect of copper. For the substances tested so far with both acute LC50 tests and life-table experiments, r(m) was not reduced at concentrations below LC50/10. When life-table experiments are used as part of environmental hazard assessments, concentrations below LC50/10 should be tested to detect substances that are potentially harmful to the environment at sublethal concentrations, rather than testing concentrations close to LC50.

TI Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario Region: Intermittent scattered activity,

SO GEOSCIENCE CANADA
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADA
AB Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario region (1840-1991) were examined for geographical groupings of possible significance for seismic hazard assessment. Prior to the 1970s, the earthquake locations were too inaccurate to support any geographical pattern of epicentres or to justify any correlation with other proposed geological or geophysical trends. For the period of best earthquake monitoring (1970 to 1991), most of the natural earthquakes were scattered under and south of Lake Ontario, with very few near its north shore and no earthquakes located on the Niagara Peninsula. Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario region are characterized by intermittent scattered activity, with no preferred trends identifiable to date.

AB Our uncontrolled phase II study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of transarterial embolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and to determine the parameters associated with a favorable response to treatment, improved survival or both. Fifty consecutive patients (25 corresponding to Okuda's stage I and 25 to stage II) with hepatocellular carcinoma (41 being multinodular or massive) were included. Transarterial embolization induced a self-limited postembolization syndrome that was well tolerated. Nevertheless, three patients died shortly after the procedure because of tumor progression (two cases) or progressive liver failure. A favorable response (extensive necrosis with reduction of tumor area greater than 50%) was achieved in 81% of the cases, and this result was independently (p < 0.05) related to a preserved performance status and to a lower alphafetoprotein concentration. The survival of the patients at 1 and 2 yr was 65% and 38%, respectively, better than the expected survival according to a mathematical model obtained from a historical series of untreated cases (42% and 20%, respectively). Cox regression analysis disclosed that both a favorable therapeutic response and a preserved physical condition (reflected by performance status of 0 or 1) were independently associated with better survival (regression coefficient -2.248 and 0.869, respectively). These data indicate that transarterial embolization has a marked antitumoral effect in patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma and that the therapeutic success is associated with improved survival. Nevertheless, because the potential benefit for survival observed in this uncontrolled study appears to be moderate, prospective controlled trials to ascertain the real usefulness of this therapeutic approach are mandatory.

TI PLANT UPTAKE OF PCBS AND OTHER ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS FROM SLUDGE-TREATED
   COAL REFUSE
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID MUNICIPAL
AB A field study of industrial organic contaminant uptake, in particular PCB uptake, by growing crops was conducted during 1990 at the St. David Coal Refuse Pile Reclamation Site, Fulton County, Illinois. The site had received one-time applications in 1987 of 785, 1570 and 3360 Mg ha-1 dry wt. of Chicago municipal sewage sludge. Corn (Zea mays L.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea capitata L.), and carrot (Daucus carota L.) were grown on the sludge treatments and soil (i.e., sludge treated coal refuse) and plant samples were analyzed. Mean PCB concentrations in the soils were less-than-or-equal-to 4 mg kg-1 dry wt. and there was no consistent effect on them of sludge application rate. Measurements on the 3360 Mg ha-1 dry wt. of sludge treatment soil indicated that several organochlorine pesticides occurred at concentrations less-than-or-equal-to 217 mug kg-1 dry wt. and several polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons occurred at <1 to 3 mg kg-1 dry wt. Mean PCB concentrations in the plant materials were <300 mug kg-1 dry wt., however, there were differences among and within crops. Concentrations decreased in the order: carrot peels > carrot tops > cabbage wrapper and inner leaves > carrot core > corn ear leaf and stover > corn grain. There was insignificant PCB in corn grain. Except for cabbage wrapper leaves, the PCB concentrations in plant materials were not related to those in soil. Soil PCB concentrations accounted for 24% of the variance in cabbage wrapper leaf PCB concentrations and the bioconcentration factor (mg PCB kg-1 dry wt. of leaf/kg PCB ha-1 dry wt. of soil) was 0.0042. There was no detection of organochlorine pesticides in plant materials grown on the 3360 Mg ha-1 dry wt. of sludge treatment soil and, except for indole and isophorone, only trace amounts of a very few other organic contaminants were observed in the plant materials. Indole ranging from no detection to 52 mg kg-1 dry wt. may have been a natural constituent of cabbage. Isophorone ranging from 14 to 79 mg kg-1 dry wt. was observed in three samples of cabbage wrapper leaves and its source is unknown. Despite the very large rates of Chicago sludge employed in this study, findings indicated that they did not (i) result in high levels of organic contamination in the treated coal refuse, and (ii) represent a significant organic contaminant hazard to the quality for food and feedstuffs of crops grown on the treated coal refuse.

AB Proliferating tumour cells in 92 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were identified by an immunohistochemical method using a monoclonal antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The rate of PCNA-positive cells in HCC tissues was positively correlated with histological grade and the tumour size and T factor of the tumour.
   In order to analyse the relationship between prognostic factors and cumulative survival rate after obtaining tumour specimens, 49 patients whose clinical courses could be followed after needle biopsy were selected for evaluation. These patients were treated by medical therapy alone. Analyses of prognostic factors by Cox's proportional hazard model revealed that the patient's prognosis was significantly correlated with PCNA-positive rates as well as the tumour size and mode of therapy. Moreover, the cumulative survival rates were significantly (P < 0.001) higher in patients with rates of PCNA-positive cells <15% than in those with greater than or equal to 15%, even when tumour sizes were under 50 mm or tumours demonstrated the same degree of histological differentiation.
   These findings indicate that the PCNA-positive rate in biopsied tissues provides useful prognostic information in patients with HCC treated only by medical therapy.

AB Patients with AIDS and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease (DMAC), as defined by the presence of a positive blood culture for MAC, were studied retrospectively to define the natural history of DMAC. All patients had fevers, severe anemia (hematocrit <26%), or both. Eighty-seven (76%) had signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings related to the gastrointestinal tract, but no distinct syndrome was identified. Sixty-nine patients received antimycobacterial therapy; assignment to therapy was not randomized. In a proportional hazards analysis, shorter survival was associated with higher initial level of mycobacteremia (relative risk [RR], 1.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.31; P < .001), while administration of antimycobacterial chemotherapy (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.70; P < .001) and antiretroviral therapy (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.73; P < .01) had protective effects. Thus, the initial level of mycobacteremia of patients with DMAC may have prognostic value, and administration of antimycobacterial and antiretroviral agents may be associated with prolonged survival.

AB It is currently recommended that patients with AIDS and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteremia receive antimycobacterial treatment. However, no study has prospectively evaluated the impact of this infection and its treatment on survival. This study prospectively followed a cohort of 367 AIDS patients with less than or equal to 50 CD4(+) cells/mu L and found that MAC bacteremia was independently associated with an increased risk of death (relative hazard [RH] = 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-2.4, P < .001). Patients with MAC bacteremia who were treated had a longer median survival than those who were not (263 vs. 139 days, P < .001); treatment was independently associated with a lower risk of death (RH = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.23-0.89, P < .001). However, 23% of patients with bacteremia died within 28 days of that diagnosis; few were treated. MAC bacteremia contributes to the death of patients with AIDS, and treatment increases survival. However, many patients will not survive long enough to receive treatment. These results underscore the importance of early diagnosis and chemoprophylaxis for MAC bacteremia.

TI EFFECTS OF SATELLITE BUNCHING ON THE PROBABILITY OF COLLISION IN
   GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid increase in the satellite population in geostationary Earth orbit is a matter of international concern, in part because of increased collision hazard. Collocated satellite pairs in GEO experience natural drift requiring periodic station-keeping impulses, leading to similar trajectories and close encounters. To assess this risk, a procedure was devised that ranks satellite pairs in GEO according to the highest number of encounters over an extended time interval. Probability of collision was determined by a geometric and a statistical approach. It was found that many pairs of satellites in GEO remain in close proximity and experience many close approaches over time. The top 10 pairs in terms of closest encounters were identified, and mean-time-to-collision based on encounter statistics was determined. Results of the study suggest that the bunching of active or inactive satellites at certain longitudes is a significant effect to be considered in the assessment of the collision hazard in the geosynchronous ring.

AB Background. The prognosis of patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia (thalassemia major) has been improved by transfusion and iron-chelation therapy. We analyzed outcome and prognostic factors among patients receiving transfusions and chelation therapy who had reached the age at which iron-induced cardiac disease, the most common cause of death, usually occurs.
   Methods. Using the duration of life without the need for either inotropic or antiarrhythmic drugs as a measure of survival without cardiac disease, we studied 97 patients born before 1976 who were treated with regular transfusions and chelation therapy. We used Cox proportional-hazards analysis to assess the effect of prognostic factors and life-table analysis to estimate freedom from cardiac disease over time.
   Results. Of the 97 patients, 59 (61 percent) had no cardiac disease; 36 (37 percent) had cardiac disease, and 18 of them had died. Univariate analysis demonstrated that factors affecting cardiac disease-free survival were age at the start of chelation therapy (P<0.001), the natural log of the serum ferritin concentration before chelation therapy began (P=0.01), the mean ferritin concentration (P<0.001), and the proportion of ferritin measurements exceeding 2500 ng per milliliter (P<0.001). With stepwise Cox modeling, only the proportion of ferritin measurements exceeding 2500 ng per milliliter affected cardiac disease-free survival (P<0.001). Patients in whom less than 33 percent of the serum ferritin values exceeded 2500 ng per milliliter had estimated rates of survival without cardiac disease of 100 percent after 10 years of chelation therapy and 91 percent after 15 years.
   Conclusions. The prognosis for survival without cardiac disease is excellent for patients with thalassemia major who receive regular transfusions and whose serum ferritin concentrations remain below 2500 ng per milliliter with chelation therapy.

AB The natural history of patients with severe nonischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) from mitral valve prolapse, who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and have normal right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) performance, has not been evaluated previously. To define natural history in this population and to deter mine if any objective variables could predict disease progression, 31 patients were followed annually with severe MR due to prolapse, who at entry were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and had normal RV and LV performance at rest by radionuclide cineangiography. Average follow-up in patients not reaching surgical end point was 4.7 years. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates were used to determine the rate of progression to either ''operable'' symptoms or to previously defined ''high risk'' ventricular performance descriptors, if the latter occurred first. Univariate comparisons of Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to define prognostically Important variables measured at entry. Fourteen patients developed symptoms warranting referral for operation; none developed high-risk ventricular performance descriptors. The annual end point risk was 10.3%. Of all covariates, only change in RV ejection fraction from rest to exercise was significantly associated with disease progression. Annual risk of progession to surgical end point was 4.9% in the subgroup in which this parameter increased with exercise and 14.7% in the subgroup without an increase (p = 0.04). Patients with severe MR due to mitral valve prolapse, who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic with normal ventricular performance, can be expected to progress to surgical indications at an annual rate of 10.3%. The change in RV ejection fraction during exercise is useful in predicting the likelihood of such progression.

AB Results in the Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) on 11 mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HA) tested for carcinogenicity in rats, mice and cynomolgus monkeys are compared to results for other chemicals. An analysis of strength of evidence of carcinogenicity for HA vs. other mutagenic carcinogens and vs. all rodent carcinogens, indicates strong carcinogenicity of HA in terms of positivity rates and multiplicity of target sites. The liver is the most frequent target site in each species. Despite several target sites in each species, concordance in target sites between rats and mice is restricted to the liver for each HA except one. In cynomolgus monkeys, liver tumors have been induced rapidly by 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). Human exposures to HA in cooked animal foods are small, in the low ppb range. A comparison of possible carcinogenic hazards from a variety of exposures to rodent carcinogens in the American diet is presented, using an index (Human Exposure/Rodent Potency, HERP) that relates human exposure to carcinogenic potency in rodents. Results indicate that there is a large background of exposures to naturally occurring rodent carcinogens in typical portions of common foods, and that possible hazards from HA rank below those of most natural pesticides and products of cooking or food preparation; synthetic pesticide residues also rank low.

AB Technology licensing is common in agricultural and natural resource sectors. An important characteristic of technology licenses is that they provide incentives for further innovation on the part of the buyer. This paper develops a risk sharing model to analyze how risk preferences and expectations about further innovation possibilities alter technology payments and the incentives for complementary local innovation. Higher buyer risk aversion, which is associated with lower fixed payments, reduces the technology buyer's level of innovation. Sellers are generally better off when innovation is anticipated, but buyers are generally better off when innovation is unanticipated, although less innovation may be realized.

AB Background The prognostic implications of alterations in heart rate variability have not been studied in a large community-based population.
   Methods and Results The first 2 hours of ambulatory ECG recordings obtained on original subjects of the Framingham Heart Study attending the 18th biennial examination were reprocessed to assess heart rate variability. Subjects with transient or persistent nonsinus rhythm, premature beats >10% of total beats, <1 hour of recording time, processed time <50% of recorded time, and those taking antiarrhythmic medications were excluded. The associations between heart rate variability measures and all-cause mortality during 4 years of follow-up were assessed. There were 736 eligible subjects with a mean age (+/-SD) of 72+/-6 years. The following five frequency domain measures and three time domain measures were obtained: very-low-frequency power (0.01 to 0.04 Hz), low-frequency power (0.04 to 0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (0.15 to 0.40 Hz), total power (0.01 to 0.40 Hz), the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power, the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals, the percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are >50 milliseconds, and the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals. During follow-up, 74 subjects died. In separate proportional hazards regression analyses that adjusted for relevant risk factors, very-low-frequency power (P<.0001), low-frequency power (P<.0001), high-frequency power (P=.0014), total power (P<.0001), and the standard deviation of total normal RR intervals (P=.0019) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. When all eight heart rate variability measures were assessed in a stepwise analysis that included other risk factors, low-frequency power entered the model first (P<.0001); thereafter, none of the other measures of heart rate variability significantly contributed to the prediction of all-cause mortality. A 1 SD decrement in low-frequency power (natural log transformed) was associated with 1.70 times greater hazard for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval of 1.37 to 2.09).
   Conclusions The estimation of heart rate variability by ambulatory monitoring offers prognostic information beyond that provided by the evaluation of traditional risk factors.

DT Article
ID NATURAL FERTILITY; FECUNDITY; AGE; RESIDUALS; HISTORIES
AB This paper develops a multistate hazards model for estimating fecundability and sterility from data on waiting times to conception. Important features of the model include separate sterile and nonsterile states, a distinction between preexisting sterility and sterility that begins after initiation of exposure, and log-normally distributed fecundability among nonsterile couples. Application of the model to data on first birth intervals from Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and the Amish shows that heterogeneity in fecundability is statistically significant at most ages, but that preexisting sterility and new sterility are unimportant before age 40. These results suggest that sterility may not be an important determinant of natural fertility until later reproductive ages.

TI GEOMORPHOLOGY AND NATURAL HAZARDS
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY

DT Article
AB Natural hazards research was initiated in the 1960's by Gilbert White and his students who promulgated a research paradigm that involved assessing risk from a natural event, identifying adjustments to cope with the hazard, determining people's perception of the event, defining the process by which people choose adjustments, and estimating the effects of public policy on the choice process. Studies of the physical system played an important role in early research, but criticisms of the paradigm resulted in a shift to a prominence of social science. Geomorphologists are working to fill gaps in knowledge of the physical aspects of individual hazards, but use of the information by social scientists will only occur if information is presented in a format that is useful to them. One format involves identifying the hazard according to seven physical parameters established by White and his colleagues: magnitude, frequency, duration, areal extent, speed of onset, spatial dispersion, and temporal spacing.
   Geomorphic hazards are regarded as related to landscape changes that affect human systems. The processes that produce the changes are rarely geomorphic in nature, but are better regarded as atmospheric or hydrologic. An examination of geomorphic hazards in four fields - soil erosion, mass movement, coastal erosion and fluvial erosion - demonstrates that advances in those fields may be evaluated in terms of the seven parameters. Geomorphologists have contributed to hazard research by focusing on the dynamics of the landforms. The prediction of occurrence, the determination of spatial and temporal characteristics, the impact of physical characteristics on people's perception, and the impact of physical characteristics on adjustment formulation. Opportunities for geomorphologists to improve our understanding of geomorphic hazards include research into the characteristics of the events particularly with respect to predicting the occurrence, and increased evaluation of the impact of human activities on natural systems.

AB The development of landscapes is commonly interpreted as the outcome of the operation of a few simple phenomenological principles amongst which the Antagonism Principle is the most fundamental one.  It states that there are two types of processes active in the formation of a landscape at the same time:  the endogenic (tectonic) and the exogenic (climate-driven) processes.  These two types of processes may more or less balance each other, in which case the actual aspect of a landscape corresponds to the instantaneous dynamic equilibrium between them.  If one of the external parameters is changed, the equilibrium is supposed to be re-established by a corresponding continuous change of the other parameters (process-response theory).  The dependences between various landscape parameters may become multivalued at junctions, cusps, etc.  In that case, the system can jump from one branch of the process-response curve to another:  a natural disaster occurs.  However, modern views on the behavior of complex systems allow a somewhat different interpretation of the above phenomenological landscape interpretation, but also in the context of the Principle of Antagonism.  However, a ''stationary'' landscape-state does now not correspond to a dynamic equilibrium, but to self-organized exogenic order at the edge of chaos.  Under conditions of such self-organized criticality there are no natural space and time scales, so that fractal statistics are applicable; spatial and temporal correlations follow a power law.  Extremely small accidental perturbations can cause the system to become unstable, leading to rapid changes in the landscape which are experienced as hazard-events.  These follow a power law distribution for size versus frequency, provided the endogenic input occurs at a constant rate; they are therefore simply part and parcel of geomorphic systems.

AB The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) was designed to focus the attention of scientists, engineers and economists on the increasing losses and deaths occurring globally as a result of natural hazards.  Geomorphologists have considerable expertise in process studies and the mapping of precursors and antecedent conditions of surficial phenomena, and important understanding of ''magnitude and frequency'' concepts applied to the earth sciences.  This paper examines several projects where geomorphologists provide significant contributions to interdisciplinary research, and suggests a framework for a comprehensive approach to natural hazards studies.

AB Assessment of hazard of erosion of shoreline bluffs requires an understanding of the natural processes and human use in these high risk areas.  As an important component associated with erosion and natural evolution of bluff shorelines, alongshore sediment transport is an essential process in defining the hazard associated with bluff erosion.  The objective of this study is the integration of an understanding of alongshore sediment transport into a proposed management framework for cohesive bluff shorelines.  A study of a ten kilometre area along the southeastern Lake Huron shoreline, at the cottage community of Horizon View, north of Goderich, Ontario examines the natural and human components which have led to the development of bluff erosion hazards.  Although dominant sediment transport is north to south alongshore, the pattern of wave refraction during south and southwest waves, suggests frequent northward transport of material from the 30 meter high bluffs at the site.  Examination of beach sediments and bluff conditions support this finding and indicate long term sediment supply and bluff instability.  Planning of future development at this location must appreciate the potential for continued bluff erosion and the study results suggest that when combined with other factors such as wave energy, bluff morphology, groundwater conditions, vegetation cover, land uses and impacts of fluctuating lake levels, studies of alongshore sediment transport can be a useful tool to assist in management of cohesive coastlines and understanding the natural hazard of bluff erosion in developed coastal areas.  A management framework for cohesive bluffs attempts to integrate an understanding of natural processes with human uses and land use policies in order to identify, assess and select a preferred management option reflecting this understanding.

AB Climatic warming during the last 100-150 years has resulted in a significant glacier ice loss from mountainous areas of the world.  Certain natural processes which pose hazards to people and development in these areas have accelerated as a result of this recent deglaciation.  These include glacier avalanches, landslides and slope instability caused by glacier debuttressing, and outburst floods from moraine- and glacier-dammed lakes.  In addition, changes in sediment and water supply induced by climatic warming and glacier retreat have altered channel and floodplain patterns of rivers draining high mountain ranges.
   The perturbation of natural processes operating in mountain environments, caused by recent climatic warming, ranges from tens of decades for moraine-dam failures to hundreds of years or more for landslides.  The recognition that climatic change as modest as that of the last century can perturb natural alpine processes has important implications for hazard assessment and future development in mountains.  Even so, these effects are probably at least an order of magnitude smaller than those associated with late Pleistocene deglaciation ca. 15,000 to 10,000 years ago.

AB Many times human perceptions of geomorphic hazards are fallacious.  Three types of misperceptions are (1) a perception of stability, which leads to the conclusion that any change is not natural, (2) a perception of instability, which leads to the conclusion that change will not cease, and (3) a perception of excessive response, which leads to the conclusion that changes will always be major.  Examples, which include the Snake, Ohio, Colorado, and Nile Rivers, incised channels, and Rocky Mountain Streams demonstrate how these perceptions can lead to litigation and unnecessary engineering works.

AB The summer 1993 flooding of the upper Mississippi River valley reminds us that floods are the most globally pervasive, environmentally diverse and continually destructive of all natural hazards.  The fact that flood damages continue to rise raises commonsense questions about conventional flood science.  Like much modern environmental science, conventional flood science has followed the model of theoretical physics.  It advanced from early emphasis on streamflow measurement to the use of simple formulae, and finally to the abstract theoretical sophistication of modern modeling studies.  Two approaches are now used to ''predict'' flood phenomena:  (1) beginning with the conventional database of measured properties of small common floods, a conceptual generalization is made to the idealized properties of the large, rare floods from which society is assumed to be at risk, and (2) explanation of detailed, specific flood phenomena is achieved through theoretical generalization (models) based on ''first principles'', which are assumed to apply to the entire class of phenomena.  Unfortunately, both approaches devote almost all their attention to methodology, increasingly mathematical, without questioning basic underlying assumptions.  Increasingly it is the assumptions, often unstated, that serve to embody the understanding of floods as real-world particular phenomena, rather than as conceptual generalities.  Such trends lead to an unease that it is not floods that are being researched by much of conventional flood science.  Rather, such flood ''science'' is increasingly becoming the mathematical manipulation of idealized parameters that are assumed to have flood-like properties.  These idealizations of flood attributes are generalized, and the resulting predicted consequences are imposed upon society through engineering designs, flood-hazard zonations, and the like.
   Geomorphological understanding of floods derives from a long geological tradition of studying indices of real processes operating in the past.  In contrast to the conceptual, theortical treatment of floods as classes or generalizations, geomorphologists study particular floods revealed as a natural experience that is recorded in the sediments, landforms, and erosional scars of past floods.  The strength of this approach is in its affinity to the commonsense perceptional basis that underpins human action.  Geomorphological flood studies, including recent advances in paleoflood hydrology, are needed as a complement to conventional hydrological approaches.  The resulting complementarity will allow the predictions of the conventional approach to be grounded in the concrete particulars of experience.  Without such grounding, flood science risks continuing as an empty quest for universal ideals while humanity, paralyzed by inaction, continues to suffer from the reality of particular floods.

AB High-magnitude floods during the monsoon season are considered to be India's recurring and leading natural disaster.  Such large floods are extremely important events, not only in terms of human impact, but also from the standpoint of geomorphic effectiveness and geomorphic work.  The Narmada and Tapi Rivers in central India are characterized by one of the most intense flood regimes in the seasonal tropics.  Modern, historical and palaeflood records indicate that large floods are relatively common hydrologic and geomorphic events on the Narmada and Tapi Rivers.  A catastrophic flood on Tapi in July 1991, that occurred from heavy rains and a dam break, represents one of the highest unit discharges yet recorded in any part of central India.  Flood competence studies indicate that the flood power of the two rivers is comparable with some of the largest historic and prehistoric floods reported from other parts of the world.  The rivers have preserved geomorphic and sedimentologic records of palaeofloods for the last two millennium, and in Choral River a 5000 year old flood record has been located.  Examination of the synoptic conditions associated with the flood generating low-pressure systems reveals that all but a few of them are the result of Bay of Bengal depressions.  The flooding in such large rivers profoundly challenges flood-hazard management, because of limited instrumental records and large spatio-temporal variation.  It is therefore imperative that the design engineering community in India incorporates the geomorphic, sedimentologic and botanic information in the planning and design of water resource development projects.

AB Debris flows are one of the natural hazards present in the southern Sierra Nevada of California.  Historic debris flow activity is documented at a USDA Forest Service research facility in the Kings River drainage related to a 1937 storm event.  No subsequent study of this phenomenon was undertaken until 1982.  Observations of debris flows over the succeeding 10 years offer an initial assessment of the physical geomorphology of debris flows in this area.  This information provides a starting point for future efforts to avoid or limit the effect of this natural hazard.
   Observations were made in the Tuolumne, Merced, San Joaquin, and Kings River drainages.  Of the twenty-six debris flows observed, six were examined in detail to provide specific data on this phenomenon.  Triggering events for debris flows in the southern Sierra Nevada include intense rainfall, rain-on-snow storms, and seasonal melting of heavy snowpacks.  Movement typically occurs at depths between 0.3 and 5 m below ground surface.  This is representative of depths for the three interfaces associated with initiation of movement:  (1) at the base of the root zone, (2) at the contact of well-weathered and less-weathered soil, and (3) at the contact between soil and unweathered bedrock.  Measurement of debris flow velocity based on indirect methods found values ranging from 2.6 m/s to 7.2 m/s (9 km/h to 26 km/h).  Recurrence intervals based on radiocarbon dates are between 425 and 500 years BP.
   Roads and other land use investments have suffered damage from debris flow activity during the 1982 to 1993 period.  Stump Springs road in the San Joaquin river drainage required US$1.4 million to repair damage primarily from 1982 debris flows.  The threat to life arising from debris flows is illustrated by the consequences of vegetation losses from wildfire near El Portal, California.  The projected population growth with associated increased infrastructure raises concern for greater impacts from future debris flow occurrence in the southern Sierra Nevada.

AB A new model is described for predicting the size and orientation of large-scale, accidental, horizontally released natural gas jet fires and the thermal radiation emitted to external objects.  The flame is represented by a frustum of a cone.  The relative influences of the jet momentum flux, buoyancy forces and the wind momentum flux are determined by correlations derived from large-scale experiments carried out over a wide range of release and weather conditions.  The surface radiative emission, from the ends and sides of the model flame shape, differs in a way that is representative of the variation of radiative emission with emitting path length through the flame.  Predictions and experimental measurements are compared.  The model can be implemented on personal computers.

AB Five hundred thirty-six residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who underwent supine vest and exercise radionuclide angiography because of known or suspected coronary artery disease, were followed for a median of 46 months to determine the prognostic value of exercise radionuclide angiography in a community population who generally did not undergo coronary angiography. There were 71 persons who experienced a new cardiac event (the initial events were cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction in 26 and 45 persons, respectively). A propartional hazards model identified 4 independent predictors of cardiac events: exercise ejection fraction (p < 0.001), exercise heart rate (p < 0.001), history of myocardial infarction (p = 0.01), and age (p = 0.04). Four-year infarct free survival was 98% for the 152 patients with a peak exercise heart rate at or above the median (122 beats/min) and an exercise ejection fraction at or above the median (0.58). In the 150 patients with a peak exercise heart rate < 122 beats/min and an exercise ejection fraction < 0.58, 4-year infarct-free survival was 68%. when this population-based cohort was compared with a referral case series previously reported from our institution, these population based patients were significantly more likely to be men, to have typical angina, to have higher exercise heart rates and exercise ejection fractions, and were less likely to be receiving beta-receptor antagonist therapy. At each level of exercise ejection fraction, the population based patients had a slightly but insignificantly greater risk than referral patients for subsequent cardiac events. These population-based data provide strong evidence of the prognostic value of exercise radionuclide angiography in community practice.

AB The exploitation of natural resources and the improper use and disposal of thousands of chemicals have resulted in environmental pollution and a potential threat to human hearth on a global scale. Increasing public concern about environmental exposure to and consequent ill health from contaminants demands informed answers based on valid risk assessment. By assessing internal exposure to pollutants, human biomonitoring focuses on early markers of potential risks to prevent serious adverse effects. Exposure assessment may provide a rational basis for risk assessment, with knowledge of the adequacy of limit values; it may also uncover long-term changes in body burdens and thus help identify the sources and transfer pathways of environmental pollutants. The techniques of biological exposure assessment should be incorporated into epidemiological studies if suitable specimens are available, such as exhaled air, blood, urine, breast milk, or adipose or keratinous tissue. Special precautions must be taken in sampling, storage, and analysis if the findings are to be interpreted correctly and reliable conclusions drawn.

ID REGIONALISM
AB Policy windows are transitory opportunities during which the likelihood of adopting new policy or legislative proposals is greater than usual. Accepted wisdom has held that natural disasters serve as focusing events that generate policy windows in their wake. This paper highlights the need for a more circumscribed understanding of when and where policy windows occur based on the experiences of three US regional planning organizations: a hand-picked commission of community leaders, a council of governments, and a special-purpose substate organization. The first operated in the San Francisco Bay Area of California following the Loma Prieta earthquake (October 1989), and the other two in South Carolina's Atlantic coastal plain after Hurricane Hugo (September 1989). The analysis concludes that natural disasters did not transform the agenda or mission of these entities. Policy windows were neither automatic outcomes of focusing events nor did they ensure the adoption of pertinent policy within the organizations investigated. Several conditions are minimally necessary for using policy windows to bring about hazard mitigation: comprehensive institutional conceptualization of hazards management, institutional strength and flexibility, and well-placed, effective policy entrepreneurs.

AB Recent epidemiologic studies have reported an association between migraine and major depression. Little is known about the mechanisms that link the two disorders, or the natural history of their co-occurrence. We examined the association between migraine and major depression in a sample of young adults, using longitudinal data.
   Method: A random sample of 1,007 young adults (21-30 years of age) members of a large HMO in Southeast Michigan was interviewed in 1989; 97% of the sample were reinterviewed 3.5 years later, in 1992. A structured diagnostic interview was used to elicit information on DSM-III-R major depression and IHS migraine in lifetime (in the 1989 interview) and during the 3.5 year follow-up interval (in the 1992 interview). Using Cox-proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates, we estimated the relative risk for major depression associated with prior migraine and the relative risk for migraine associated with prior major depression.
   Results: In this sample of young adults, the incidence of migraine per 1,000 person years, based on the prospectively gathered data, was 5.0 in males and 22.0 in females. The estimated relative risk for major depression associated with prior migraine, adjusted for sex and education, was 3.2 (95% CI 2.34. 6). The adjusted relative risk for migraine associated with prior major depression was 3.1 (95% CI 2.0-5.0).
   Conclusions: The study provides the first body of evidence that the previously observed cross-sectional association between migraine and major depression can result from bidirectional influences, with each disorder increasing the risk for first onset of the other. The explanation that major depression in persons with migraine represents a psychologic response to migraine attacks would have been more plausible had we found an influence only from migraine to depression. By diminishing the plausibility of a simple causal explanation for the migraine-depression comorbidity, the findings favor the shared mechanisms explanation.

AB The progression of primary biliary cirrhosis was studied in 312 patients who were seen at the Mayo Clinic between January 1974 and May 1984. Follow-up was extended to April 30, 1988, by which time 140 of the patients had died and 29 had undergone orthotopic liver transplantation. These patients generated 1,945 patient visits that enabled us to study the change in the prognostic variables of primary biliary cirrhosis (age, bilirubin value, albumin value, prothrombin time and edema) from the time of referral. Also, using this database and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model, we developed an updated model for primary biliary cirrhosis that can be used to predict short-term survival at any time in the course of the disease. This model uses the values of the prognostic variables measured at the latest patient visit. Comparison of predicted survival from the update model and the natural history model of primary biliary cirrhosis showed that the updated model was superior to the original model for predicting short-term survival. This finding applied to both the Mayo Clinic patients and an independent set of 83 Dutch patients. The Mayo updated model is recommended for improving the accuracy of predictions of survival during the 2 yr after a patient visit.

AB The small drainage basin of Cal Parisa was instrumented in early 1989 to study the hydrological and sediment routing behaviour of Mediterranean mountain areas formerly used for agriculture but now abandoned. Environmental changes produced by agricultural land use included the construction of terraces on the major part of the basin and subsequent artificial channelling of surface waters. Field observations and hydrological data suggest that storm runoff is generated by the contributing role of saturated areas, most of them originating from the terrace system. Modelling of the natural conditions before terracing, with the help of TOPMODEL, supports the hypothesis that terracing promotes the premature formation of saturated areas, increasing saturation overland flow at the expense of lower baseflow and actual evapotranspiration. Now, after land abandonment, the more relevant environmental hazard is linked to the spontaneous reorganization of the unmaintained artificial drainage network.

AB In order to utilize limited historical wind records for estimating extreme wind speeds for natural hazards damage mitigation, a Markov chain model for generating long-term annual extreme winds, on the basis of short-term records, is investigated. Basically, this simulation model consists of three components. They are state of wind speeds, wind speed distribution functions, and transition probability matrices.
   The basic strategy of our simulation model is to generate the time series of hourly wind speeds in parts: for those wind associated with well-behaved climates and those with extreme winds. Applications of this model to generate long-term extreme winds, on the basis of short records at Houston Intercontinental Airport of Texas, are demonstrated.

AB Purpose: Among various surgical techniques for renal artery reconstruction (RAX), anatomic aortorenal bypass has been the preferred standard. Yet concern regarding origin of the bypass from a diseased aorta and desire to avoid a major aortic operation in these patients who are often at poor risk has led to increasing use of extraanatomic bypass grafting, particularly hepatorenal and splenorenal bypass. This study was conducted to compare the safety and long-term performance of these different techniques of renal artery reconstruction.
   Methods: We reviewed a 15-year (1976 to 1991) experience with 323 surgical RAR performed in 285 patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease. Long-term patency and survival rates were analyzed by life-table methods. Variables potentially affecting early failure of the RAR and perioperative and late mortality rates were examined by Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: Diffuse atherosclerosis characterized the patients' clinical profile. Clinically evident coronary artery disease was present in 54% of patients, and some degree of renal insufficiency was present in 60%. Ninety-five percent of patients had hypertension with poor control of hypertension seen in 50%. Aortic disease necessitated combined aortic grafting and RAR in 43% of the study group. Various techniques of RAR were used as follows: endarterectomy or patch angioplasty, 8.5%; extraanatomic bypass grafting, 37% (hepatorenal, 62; splenorenal, 52; iliorenal, 7); and aortorenal bypass grafting, 54% (native aorta, 34; combined aortic graft and RAR, 140). Early failure of the RAR occurred in 5% of cases, and the operative mortality rate for the entire cohort was 5.6%. Median follow-up duration was 9.4 years. A comparison of early and late patency for the major types of RAR revealed equivalent (p = 0.44) performance of aortorenal and extraanatomic bypass grafting. Perioperative complications occurred more frequently (p < 0.02) in patients undergoing combined operations. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 75%.
   Conclusions: Because extraanatomic bypass grafting can provide long-term results equivalent to aortorenal bypass grafting, the choice among techniques for RAR in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis should be based on both technical and operative safety considerations, rather than adherence to aortorenal bypass grafting as an inherently superior technique.

AB 1175 premenopausal women whose date of last menstrual period was known were followed up for up to 20 years (average 8 years) after surgery for breast cancer. 525 patients were in the follicular phase and 650 in the luteal phase.
   We observed 192 unfavourable events among patients operated on during the follicular phase (36.6%) and 192 among patients operated on during the luteal phase (29.6%). The effect of phase was restricted to patients with positive axillary nodes. The 5-year relapse-free survival was 75.5% in 246 node-positive patients operated on during the luteal phase and 63.3% in 190 node-positive patients who had surgery during the follicular phase. The hazard ratio at Cox multivariate analysis was 1.329 for all patients (p=0.006) and 1.431 for node-positive patients (p=0.03).
   In our study, premenopausal patients with breast cancer and positive axillary nodes operated on during the luteal phase had a significantly better prognosis than patients operated on during the follicular phase. It may be that the processes of cell metastases, such as loss of adhesiveness, may be enhanced by high concentrations of unopposed oestrogens or by reduced activity of natural killer cells during the first half of the menstrual cycle.

AB Objective: To estimate the age-specific relative risk of progression from HIV seroconversion to onset of AIDS in hemophiliacs and homosexual men.
   Design: Prospective follow-up data from HIV seroconversion to AIDS was analyzed for hemophiliacs in the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study and for homosexual men in the International Registry of Seroconverters. Follow-up was censored at 1 July 1987 to obtain natural history estimates unaffected by therapies that were widely used after this date. The age-specific relative hazard of progression was estimated using nonparametric proportional hazards models and the baseline hazard function was described using spline models.
   Results: Among the 373 children and adults with hemophilia and the 1020 adult homosexual men, each 10-year increment in age at seroconversion was associated with a 1.6- and 1.4-fold increase in the hazard of progression, respectively. The effect of age was highly significant among hemophiliacs. The magnitude of the effect was consistent in different cohorts of homosexual men, although it was not nominally significant. Furthermore, there was a significant increase (1.9-fold higher) in progression rates among homosexual men above rather than below 35 years of age at seroconversion. After adjusting for age, progression Fates among hemophiliacs were significantly slower, possibly because Kaposi's sarcoma was rare. In both groups, the annual hazard rate increased during the first 5 years after seroconversion, but broad confidence limits prevented us from establishing hazard trends beyond this time.
   Conclusions: Estimates of the aggregate incubation time distribution were substantially shorter in older compared with younger individuals. The increasing risk with age was similar in hemophiliacs and homosexual men, suggesting that age is an endogenous host factor. These findings can be incorporated into newly developed backcalculation models to estimate HIV infection incidence by age group from age-specific AIDS surveillance data.

AB The mortality and a drift-related response of juvenile Gammarus Pulex (L.) exposed for 10 days to natural sediments and to copper treatments in the presence of a sediment were recorded. Tests were performed under non-acidified and acidified conditions. Mortality of G. pulex exposed under non-acidified conditions was not greater than 20%. Acidification caused an increase in mortality related to the buffering capacity of the sediments and the test concentrations of copper. Sediment type affected the drift response under non-acidified and acidified conditions. Gammarids in systems ultimately causing the highest mortality spent the most time in the water column for each 'sub-lethal' exposure period. The behavior of G. pulex was affected by the copper treatments in a dose-related manner, and responses in the 702, 942 and 1343 mug l-1 initial test copper concentrations were significantly higher than in the control. Acidification accentuated behavioral differences and gammarids in the 136 mug l-1 initial copper test concentration had a significantly higher drift response than control animals after 168 h of exposure. The findings are discussed with respect to the buffering capacities of test systems, the fate of copper under non-acidified and acidified conditions, and the potential of drift for assessing the hazard of chemicals.

TI INCIDENCE AND PROGNOSIS OF OBSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT-VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW
   TRACT IN LIVERPOOL (1960-91) - A STUDY OF 313 PATIENTS

AB Objective-To determine the incidence of the various types of obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract in patients born in the five health districts of Liverpool and to compare their prognosis into early adult life.
   Design-Notes of all patients with obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract born in the study area between 1960 and 1991 were reviewed. Patients with hypoplastic left ventricle, mitral valve atresia, and those with discordant atrioventricular or ventriculoarterial connections were excluded. Survivors were traced and assessed clinically; eight were lost to follow up.
   Results-Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract occurred in 313 patients (67% male), giving an incidence of 6.1/10 000 live births. The median (range) age at presentation was 13.9 months (0-20 yr). Aortic valve stenosis occurred in 71.2%: subvalve in 13.7%, supravalve in 7.7%, and multilevel in 7.4%. The median (range) duration of follow up was 10.0 (1-29) yr. Aortic regurgitation at presentation occurred more often (p < 0.001) in patients with subvalve stenosis than in those with other types of obstruction, but there was an increased incidence (p < 0.001) at follow up in patients with valve stenosis. Ninety eight patients (31.3%) underwent operation. The reoperation rate was 27% for valve stenosis and 9% for subvalve obstruction. No patients with supravalve stenosis underwent reoperation. The median duration from first operation to aortic valve replacement (17 patients) was 12.3 years. Hazard analysis confirmed that the risk of death was higher in patients presenting at a younger age, with more severe stenosis, and those with subaortic, multilevel obstruction or a syndrome. Hazard analysis also showed that the risk of a clinical event (surgery, balloon dilatation, or endocarditis) was greater in patients who presented at a younger age, with more severe stenosis or aortic regurgitation, and in those with subvalve or multilevel obstruction.
   Conclusions-Aortic valve stenosis was the most common type of obstruction. Hazard analysis indicates that the age and severity of obstruction at presentation have a significant effect on survival and freedom from a clinical event. The risk of premature death in patients presenting with moderately severe stenosis is reasonably small, increases considerably in those with subvalve, supravalve, and multilevel obstruction. Patients who present with mild valve stenosis have a good prognosis. The risk of sudden death is less than previous predictions. Patients with subvalve and multilevel obstruction, even when mild at presentation, are more likely to undergo intervention or develop endocarditis than those with valve or supravalve stenosis. Follow up into adult life is essential.

AB Fumonisins are secondary metabolites of Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium proliferatum and several other Fusaria that commonly contaminate com. Only recently discovered in 1988, these mycotoxins appear to be the causative agents of several toxicoses in animals that result from ingestion of moldy com or corn-based feeds. The syndromes observed vary considerably among the different species affected and include brain lesions in equids, lung edema in swine, and nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and hepatocellular carcinoma in laboratory rats. There is also evidence that suggests that F. moniliforme and fumonisins may also be responsible for esophageal cancer in humans in certain areas of the world where moldy com is frequently consumed. Studies are currently underway to determine the extent of the hazards posed by fumonisins, and whether controls in the form of regulatory action levels may be necessary.

AB Mineral fibers are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are widely used in industry in such applications as insulators. We have previously shown that asbestos fibers induce aneuploidy in oocytes of Drosophila melanogaster; here we extend those studies by testing refractory ceramic fibers (RCFs) for their mutagenicity to germ cells. The results establish that the tested RCFs are inducers of aneuploidy following feeding of adult females. A subset of the RCFs were also effective following larval feeding. Our results suggest that RCFs, like certain asbestos fibers, may pose a hazard to germ cells.

AB Objective: To compare the long-term outcome in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) among those treated with carotid endarterectomy (CE) or medical therapy.
   Background: Until randomized trials are completed, treatment of ACS will depend on identification of subgroups likely to benefit from CE.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was done on 215 patients with ACS: 107 underwent CE, and 108 were treated medically (MED). A neurologist reviewed medical records and performed a telephone interview to detect outcome (stroke and death). Mean follow-up was 3.8 years; only 4% were lost to follow-up.
   Results: Among CE patients, there was a 4.7% risk of postoperative ipsilateral stroke within 30 days. Four of five postoperative strokes occurred among patients with prior contralateral symptoms. There was no significant difference between CE and MED in the cumulative life-table 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke, any stroke, or survival free of any stroke. Among diabetics, however, there were no ipsilateral strokes at 5 years after CE compared to 20% in MED (p = 0.03). Excluding postoperative complications, the 5-year risk of ipsilateral stroke was reduced among CE patients who ''ever smoked'' (CE 1%, MED 8%, P = 0.03) and the 5-year risk of any stroke was reduced among CE patients who had no prior myocardial infarction (CE 6%, MED 16%, p = 0.02). Among those with prior contralateral carotid territory symptoms, the 5-year risk of any stroke was worse in the MED patients (CE 5% MED 32%, p = 0.004). Among CE patients, a Cox proportional hazards model determined that the independent predictors of worse long-term outcome were: a history of myocardial infarction; admission systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg; and age greater than 65.
   Conclusion: The approach to patients with ACS will await completion of large, randomized clinical trials, now in progress. Even if these studies are negative, there may remain specific subgroups of patients who show clear benefit from carotid endarterectomy.

TI RISK IN CHINA - COMPARATIVE AND HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ITS SOCIAL
   CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB China's rapid industrial development and growing environmental problems call attention to how China approaches the management of risk. Traditional approaches to flood control, as well as contemporary approaches to technological hazards, suggests that risk management in China has been biased by historical and cultural forces tending towards highly centralized schemes. Unfortunately, these can be defeated by natural and social phenomena beyond the reach of the state's authority, often with a loss of confidence in the government. Contemporary China can be thought of as in a ''risk transition'' with regard to the hazards it faces, and the institutional strategies devised to deal with them.

AB Background: Previous malignant melanoma studies regarding prognostic factors have often selected their patients from hospitals. Unfortunately, most of these studies have had small numbers of patients, consisted of short-term data sets, omitted important factors, did not optimize histopathologic classification, had too short or inadequate follow-up, and did not test their predictive models. Purpose: Our study goals were to identify independent clinical and histopathologic determinants of survival in malignant melanoma, to analyze changes in prognostic value over follow-up time, and, finally to construct a prognostic index. Methods: A random sample from the Swedish Cancer Registry of the records of 498 (246 men and 252 women) patients defined by gender, five 5-year time periods of diagnosis from 1960 through 1984, and five anatomic sites formed the cohort on whom data were analyzed by univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses were based on data on 476 patients with complete information about all variables. All patients in the cohort had complete follow-up through December 31, 1989. Clinical information was abstracted and recorded as: date of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, sex, age, anatomic site of primary tumor, date of death, and cause of death. Histopathologic slides were re-examined and classified with regard to histogenetic type, level of invasion, tumor thickness, ulceration, vascular invasion, regression, lymphocytic reaction, pre-existing nevus, and cell type. Results: All variables, except pre-existing nevus and cell type, were significant predictors of survival. In the multivariate analyses including all variables, women still had a significant, 33% lower relative hazard than men. The prognosis was poor in the youngest age group. Patients with external ear, scalp-neck, and trunk-located melanoma had increasing relative hazard when all variables were included. Regional metastases and tumor thickness remained independent prognostic factors. No significant association between histogenetic type or level of invasion persisted. Patients whose tumors showed ulceration or vascular invasion had lower relative hazard when all variables were included. Level of invasion, tumor thickness, ulceration, and vascular invasion were significantly associated with the prognosis during both short- and long-term follow-up. The patients were subgrouped according to percentage fractions of their score on the prognostic index. Survival curves for these groups of patients were well separated, thus identifying patients with a low or high risk of death from malignant melanoma. Conclusion: The present population-based study identifies independent clinical and histopathologic predictors of survival in cutaneous malignant melanoma and emphasizes the role of histopathologic characteristics such as tumor thickness, ulceration, and vascular invasion besides anatomic site.

AB The authors examined the association of fatal breast cancer and cigarette smoking in a large, prospective mortality study of US adults. After 6 years of follow-up, 880 cases of fatal breast cancer we re observed in a cohort of 604,412 women who were cancer-free at interview in 1982. Cox proportional hazards modeling, adjusted for other risk factors, found that current smoking was significantly related to fatal breast cancer risk (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.50). A negative association was observed for former smokers, but this was not statistically significant (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03). The association of current smoking with fatal breast cancer risk increased with increasing numbers of cigarettes per day and with total number of years smoked. For smokers of 40 or more cigarettes per day, the rate ratio was 1.74 (95% CI 1.15-2.62). The authors hypothesize that these results may be due to either a poorer prognosis among breast cancer cases who smoke or a delayed diagnosis among current smokers who do not receive mammograms as often as never or former smokers. Women who smoke should be targeted for breast cancer screening services.

AB Under natural conditions, the incidence of Penicillium citrinum was more in linum cake (48%) than in mustard cake (22%).  But, the population of P. citrinum was quite high in mustard cake (9.2x10(2)) colonies/g) as compared to linum cake (4.2x10(2) colonies/g).  The samples of mustard and linum cakes were naturally infested with 42.3 and 55.2 per cent toxigenic strains of P. citrinum, as they elaborated traces to 1850 ppb and 120 to 2670 ppb citrinin in YES liquid medium respectively.  Chemical analysis revealed presence of citrinin in both, but it was more in mustard cakes (34.9%) than in linum cakes (32.2%).  Though, the concentration was higher in linum cake (210 to 2960 ppb) against 180 to 2270 ppb in mustard cake.  Occurrence of citrinin in mustard and linum cakes is a serious health hazard to dairy cattle.

TI RESEARCH PRIORITIES IN OCCUPATIONAL-MEDICINE - A SURVEY OF
   UNITED-KINGDOM MEDICAL OPINION BY THE DELPHI TECHNIQUE

DT Article
ID HEALTH RESEARCH; WORK
AB An attempt to achieve an agreed set of priorities for research in occupational medicine was undertaken by the Delphi technique. Fifty three senior practitioners of occupational medicine in academe (25) and industry or government (28) were canvassed about their views and choices for priority activity. Forty six (86%) responded to the initial enquiry and 48 (91%) provided rank order choices from a second, more detailed questionnaire. The first priority for more research on the natural history of work related ill health identified musculoskeletal disorders of the back and upper limbs followed-by asthma, accidents, skin disorders, vibration induced disease, suicide and depression, and finally hearing loss. The second priority area was audit and particularly the need for its use in occupational health screening procedures. Environmental impact of industrial activity was third with the community health effects being more important than individual health effects. Stress related disease was fourth with emphasis on risk factors. The fifth area was neuropsychological effects of work exposures particularly the need for more research on diagnostic tests. Other assorted areas of concern were the cost effectiveness of occupational health, risk assessment, reproductive hazards, the effects of pharmacological agents, and the development of biomarkers as early evidence of an exposure effect. The remarkable degree of unanimity on the issues and choices and the general agreement between physicians from academe and industry on what constitute the priorities warrants further discussion and positive action.

TI PLANS CAN MATTER - THE ROLE OF LAND-USE PLANS AND STATE PLANNING
   MANDATES IN LIMITING THE DEVELOPMENT OF HAZARDOUS AREAS
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION
AB How can governments (and communities) reduce susceptibility to losses in natural disasters? Can formally adopted plans be used as a tool in the policy-making process? Raymond J. Burby and Linda C. Dalton link these two issues in an analysis which uses empirical data gathered from 176 local governments in five states to show that land-use plans can serve as a vehicle for limiting development of areas at risk from natural hazards. The authors demonstrate that without state mandates requiring both plans and attention to natural hazards, a number of local governments will ignore opportunities for risk reduction through planning and development-limiting land use regulations. Their findings have important implications for administrative theory and practice because they provide systematic evidence that the rational consideration of community needs and policy alternatives involved in preparation of land use plans can produce tangible community benefits, and that such benefits may not be realized without state requirements for local planning.

DE LANDSLIDING; SLOPE STABILITY; RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Definitions for risk and hazard which are suited to landslide risk assessment are presented. Acceptable risk is discussed in relation to other risks accepted by the community, and acceptable specific risks are proposed, depending on whether the landsliding is natural or sliding of a man-made slope. Methods for quantifying the risk are discussed, and qualitative definitions are suggested for use when these are desirable. Examples are given of use of risk assessment in areas affected by landsliding and debris flows.

AB Background. The spectrum of pulmonary fibrohistiocytic lesions (PFL) ranges from benign fibrohistiocytoma or inflammatory pseudotumor, fibrohistiocytic type (IP), to fibrohistiocytic lesions of borderline malignant appearance (B), to unequivocal malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). The authors reviewed a spectrum of PFL in an attempt to define their natural history and establish independent factors of prognostic significance.
   Methods. Thirty-one fibrohistiocytic lesions were analyzed by multiple clinical, gross, and microscopic factors. Prognostic factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results. After histopathologic review, the cases were classified into IP (15 cases), B (3 cases), and MFH (13 cases). IP tended to occur in younger patients (median age, 30 years; range, 11-64 years) than did MFH (median age, 54 years; range, 12-81 years) (P = 0.03). All 15 patients with IP and 3 patients with B survived. Local recurrence developed in 2 patients with IP and 6 patients with MFH. Distant metastases occurred in 7 patients with MFH. Eight of 13 patients with MFH died of disease, with a median survival time of 16 months (range, 6-36). For all pulmonary fibrohistiocytic lesions, univariate Cox regression analysis disclosed several statistically significant prognostic factors associated with mortality: metastasis (P = 0.0005), significant necrosis (P = 0.0015), local recurrence (P = 0.003), bizarre giant cells (P = 0.0282), mitoses greater than or equal to 3 per 50 high-power fields (P = 0.0286), stage at surgery (P = 0.002), high cellularity (P = 0.0267), and poor circumscription (P = 0.0294). Other parameters (age, sex, symptoms, laterality, location, atypical mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, degree of fibrosis, and size) were not significant prognostic factors. By multivariate Cox regression analysis, metastasis was the most significant individual parameter (P = 0.002), overriding all other prognostic factors. With metastasis removed from the model, local recurrence (P = 0.0199) and necrosis (P = 0.037) were the other significant independent prognostic factors.
   Conclusions. Certain individual clinical, gross, and microscopic features have prognostic relevance in determining survival time in pulmonary fibrohistiocytic lesions.

AB Background The prognosis of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) remains a major problem for the planning and assessment of therapeutic interventions. The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize mortality in a Mexican population of patients with PPH and to investigate factors associated with survival and (2) to test the applicability in this population of the prognostic equation proposed by the US National Institutes of Health study on PPH.
   Methods and Results A dynamic cohort of patients with PPH at our institution were enrolled between June 1977 and August 1991 and prospectively followed at regular intervals through September 1992. Measurements at diagnosis included hemodynamic and pulmonary function variables in addition to information on demographic data and medical history. The response to vasodilator treatment was also analyzed. The estimated median survival of the group was 4.04 years (95% confidence interval, 2.98 to 5.08 years). Variables associated with poor survival (univariate analysis) included an elevated mean right atrial pressure, a decreased cardiac index, and a decreased mixed venous Po,. A reduced forced vital capacity and the absence of vasodilator treatment were also associated with poor survival. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to assess the adjusted hazard ratios, hence the relative contributions of the variables controlling for confounding. Reduced forced vital capacity and cardiac index and increased right atrial pressure were still significantly associated as risk factors for survival in patients with PPH. Survival as computed by the equation correlated with real survival of PPH patients with positive predictive values of 87%, 91%, and 89% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The equation, however, was relatively unable to predict deaths in our population, in part because of the strict limits of poor prognosis.
   Conclusions Mortality in PPH is largely associated with hemodynamic variables that assess right ventricular function. The proposed prognostic equation had a high sensitivity and a relatively low specificity to predict survival in our PPH population. To improve this specificity it may be necessary to increase the limits of poor prognosis as defined by the equation.

AB The independent predictors of progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) were investigated by multivariate life table analysis, using Cox's proportional hazard model, in 225 patients with IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy (Bx). There were 105 men and 120 women. Mean age at Bx was 32.5 years. The follow-up period following Bx was 4.0 +/- 2.6 yrs, ranging from 5 months to 11 yrs. The clinical parameters analyzed were age at the time of discovery of the disease, age at Bx, intervals from discovery to Bx, presence or absence of macrohematuria, and clinical data at Bx such as presence or absence of hypertension, the degree of hematuria, the amount of urinary protein excretion, serum creatinine and serum IgA concentration. The following immunopathological parameters were also examined; glomerular hypercellularity index, percentage of glomeruli associated with segmental lesions such as tuft adhesions, crescents and segmental sclerosis, percentage of obliterated glomeruli by global sclerosis, severity of interstitial infiltration, fibrosis, arterial wall thickening, arterial hyaline changes, and intensity of the depositions of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q and fibrinogen by immunofluorescent study. Among all clinical and pathologic parameters examined, the following parameters were proved to be significant independent predictors of progression of IgAN: serum creatinine exceeding 1.5 mg/dl in men and 1.3 mg/dl in women, proteinuria over 2 g/day, segmental lesions involving more than 25% of glomeruli and interstitial fibrosis occupying more than 25% of cortical area. Since the interstitial fibrosis is an irreversible sclerotic change which is the secondary abnormality to glomerular change, glomerular segmental lesions such as tuft adhesion, crescent or segmental sclerosis, all of which are frequently found to be associated with each other, seems to be the most important primary pathological change, indicating ongoing inflammation and subsequent progression to irreversible obliteration of glomerular capillaries.

AB The incidence of and risk factors for renal failure were determined in 912 Oklahoma Indians with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in a follow-up study conducted between 1987 and 1990. The incidence rate was 15.7/1,000 person-years after an average follow-up time of 10.2 years. Among those who had no qualitatively positive proteinuria at baseline, the incidence of renal failure was 10.3/1,000 person-years compared with 19.3 and 56.2/1,000 person-years, respectively, in those with slight and heavy proteinuria at baseline. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) greater-than-or-equal-to 11.1 mM (200 mg/dl) increased the risk of renal failure to 2.9-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-4.6) higher than a level <7.8 mM (140 mg/dl), and twofold (95% CI = 1.4-3.1) higher than a level between 7.8 (140 mg/dl) and 11.1 mM (200 mg/dl). The hypertensive patient had twice the incidence of renal failure than the normotensive subject (rate ratio = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.4-3.0). Patients with a lower blood pressure under antihypertensive medication had a lower incidence of renal failure than those whose hypertension remained uncontrolled with or without use of medication. Significant independent risk factors for renal failure, identified from Cox's proportional hazards model, were duration of diabetes, FPG, age, hypertension, and insulin use (P < 0.05). In patients without proteinuria at baseline, FPG and hypertension were significant predictors of renal failure as identified by multivariate analyses, whereas in patients who had proteinuria at baseline, insulin use was significant. Thus, hyperglycemic and hypertension control are suggested strongly for diabetic Oklahoma Indians as potential strategies to prevent the development of renal failure.

AB This study was undertaken to (a) determine wastewater treatment effectiveness using two freshwater organisms, (b) compare acute toxicity results from the two species exposed to the wastewaters, and (c) link acute and potential developmental toxicity of wastewaters in one organism. The acute toxicities of several pretreatment and post-treatment industrial waste-water samples were evaluated with adult Hydra attenuata (92- or 96-h exposure) and fathead minnows (96-h exposure). The acute LC50s agreed closely when results in Hydra attenuata were compared with those from fathead minnow tests. Acute LC50s ranged from 3 to > 100% of sample with hydra, and from 1.0 to > 100% of sample with fathead minnows. The results provided strong evidence of treatment effectiveness because toxicity decreased with progressive stages of treatment. Previously the Hydra Developmental Toxicity Assay (Hydra Assay) was used as a prescreen mainly for in vitro assessment of developmental toxicity with pure compounds and to prioritize toxicants according to selective toxicity to the developing embryo (A/D ratio). Recently we modified the assay for testing natural waters and wastewaters; hence, some of the wastewater samples also were tested for their developmental toxicity. In this case, the relative selective toxicity (A/D ratio) of these wastewater samples ranged from 0.7 to 2.1, indicating that no sample was uniquely toxic to the developing embryo, although acute toxicity was manifested. Overall, our results indicate the Hydra Assay functions appropriately in assessments of acute and developmental toxicity of industrial wastewaters and may be a simple and useful tool in a battery of tests for broader scale detection of environmental hazards.

TI THE ROLE OF GEOMORPHOLOGY IN ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper aims to define the role of Geomorphology in the assessment of the impact of human activities on the environment. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) should be carried out for specific projects, in order to evaluate their suitability for the quality of the environment. In fact, each planned activity may have an impact on various environmental components. Among these, the natural component must be examined in terms of geomorphological hazards, which may endanger a project, and of geomorphological assets (elements forming the educational and cultural heritage of the landscape), which may be damaged to various extents by human activities. The relationships between humans and environment are taken into account. with particular attention to the effects of a project on the geomorphological environment. From a geomorphological point of view, after having assessed the suitability of a certain location, mainly with respect to its morphography and morphometry. the geomorphological hazards of the area which may threaten the project (risk) must be considered; then the geomorphological assets, which may be damaged by the same project (direct impact) have to be individuated. Human activities may produCe two other kinds of effect: the first refers to the consequences of the geomorphological hazards induced by a project on the project itself (direct risk ) and on the surronding areas (indirect risk); the second takes into account the potential deterioration of a geomorphological asset due to hazards induced by the project ( indirect impact). Examples of these different cases are presented.

DT Article
DE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL; CHEMICAL PESTICIDES; INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT;
   PESTS; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Food production in Africa is declining, while her population is increasing rapidly. Some factors responsible for low food productivity are mentioned; special attention is given to the problem of agricultural pests. The hazards of overuse of pesticides in developed countries are cited to caution farmers in developing countries from getting drawn into a similar situation when attempting to solve pest problems. Integrated pest management (IPM), which aims to increase food productivity and profitability without endangering the environment, is recommended as a sustainable solution to the pesticide problem. The role of biological control agents, i.e., introduction, augmentation and preservation of natural enemies is emphasized. In developing sustainable agriculture through IPM, the importance of incorporating farmers' traditional methods of farming into an IPM package and of identifying farmers' overriding concerns, is recommended as a prerequisite to the acceptability and success of such packages.

AB The purpose of this study was to characterize quantitative changes in circulating infected cells over the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in relation to clinical/immunological outcome. HIV-1 gag DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) co-cultures were performed on limiting dilutions of cryopreserved PBMC from specimens collected at enrollment and after 5 years of follow-up from nine seropositive subjects classified as rapid progressors, nine intermediate progressors, and 10 nonprogressors. Limiting dilution PCR was also performed on serial pre/postseroconversion specimens from 18 seroconvertors. By quantitative DNA PCR analysis, the infected cell burden was significantly higher at enrollment in the RP [mean of 330 PCR units (PCRU)/10(6) PBMCs] than in the IP (160 PCRU/10(6) PBMCs) and NP (73 PCRU/10(6) PBMCs) groups (p = 0.05). When results were analyzed on an individual level with proportional hazard regression, baseline PCRU (p = 0.05) and CD4 slope (p = 0.0007) were significantly associated with developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 5 years, but baseline tissue culture infectious units (TCIU) was not. The increase in PCR-positive cells after 5 years was modest in all three groups (two- to fivefold), whereas the proportion of PCR-positive cells that yielded virus in culture increased significantly (21- to 31-fold) over time in all three groups. Infected cell burden in postseroconversion specimens was relatively stable within each subject, but varied greatly (from 1.6 to 1,024 PCRU/10(6) PBMCs) among subjects. Decline in CD4 cell count during the 4 years following seroconversion was significantly greater for subjects who stabilized at higher (>50 PCRU/10(6)) infected cell burdens following initial infection (p = 0.001). The concentration of circulating infected cells is determined to a great extent at seroconversion and remains relatively stable over the ensuing course of infection. Host response to initial infection may be critical in determining extent of early viral dissemination and subsequent disease course.

AB Wage and unemployment responses to changes in economic environment are compared for efficiency wage and frictional models. Changes in aggregate demand, persistence of job-specific shocks, cost of living, and unemployment benefits are considered. Wages and unemployment move in the same direction in the two models, except that an upward shift in aggregate labor demand can reduce the real wage in the efficiency wage, but not the frictional, model. In a numerical simulation calibrated to U.S. data, real productivity shocks in the efficiency wage model yield a ratio of unemployment to wage variability close to that of the United States.

AB Several models of a population survival curve composed of two piecewise exponential distributions are developed. In one formulation the hazard rate changes at a point that is an unobservable random variable that varies between individuals. The population hazard function may decrease with age even when all individuals' hazards are increasing. In a second formulation, the population hazard function is modeled directly. Several models are fit to the survival history of a cohort of 5751 highly inbred male Drosophila melanogaster and the British coal mining disaster data.

AB The People's Republic of China suffers each year from various environmental hazards. Although risk perception study has a 40-year history in Europe and North America, little is known about risk perception in China. Previous studies of risk perception have primarily focused on unnatural hazards, but China has experinced many natural environmental hazards. Therefore, the Chinese public's perceptions of environmental hazard risks must be considered in order to support the IDNDR program. The Chinese public's perceptions of environmental hazards are similar to those of Europeans and North Americans, but different characteristics are observed.

AB Generally, hazards research and literature has treated natural and technological disasters as separate entities. This study attempts to determine how frequently interaction between these two types of disaster took place in the United States from 1980-1989. Data were collected by performing a literature review, contacting organizations and individuals active in hazards research and mitigation, and through a questionnaire sent to the emergency management agencies of all 50 states. The consensus derived from the data is that the number of incidents where natural and technological disasters interact is rising while preparations, which recognize the complications inherent in such combined events, remain cursory. There is a pressing need for states to record, and make available to managers, information regarding the number of combined natural/technological events affecting their areas. Only when such data are available will it be possible to make appropriate decisions regarding the best way to reduce the effects of a natural disaster causing a catastrophic release of hazardous materials.

AB The inconclusive debate about Fries' theory of ''natural death and the compression of morbidity'' has diverted attention from two key issues-the modifiability and related dynamics of functional impairment in late adulthood. Evidence is presented from a large (N = 11,000) panel of adults aged initially 58-63 over the period of a decade which documents substantial modification of functional status. Further, patterned changes in functional status are related to the dynamics of income, historically a major determinant of functional status, and independently to educational attainment. The dynamics of functional status, of income, and of their relationship are explored using discrete time hazard models in an event history analysis incorporating time-varying income and functional status indicators. The importance of income and of education as positive, independent predictors of functional status and patterned changes of functional status is confirmed. The implications of this finding for differentiating distal (e.g. education) and proximate (e.g. income) measures of socioeconomic status and for assessing competing theories of social causation and social selection are discussed.

AB The loss of soil fertility is an important problem in large areas that have been utilised for agricultural production during the last 20 years. Enhanced concentration, intensification and specialisation of crop and livestock production without sufficient consideration of the natural site specific soil and climate conditions caused pronounced degradation and partly irreversible damage of the soil including such processes as soil compaction, water and wind erosion, water logging, chemical degradation and humus loss. With regard to Germany the sandy and loamy to sandy soils in the northern part of the country are more impacted than the naturally loamy soils in southern Germany. Clearly, damaged soils cannot accomplish their ecological 'tasks' (e.g. buffer, filter, storage function) in the various ecosystems of the landscape. In addition, man's activity particularly in highly industrialized nations brought about severe problems with regard to forest ecosystem health. For example, in Germany and elsewhere new types of forest decline are occurring since the mid 1970s. This damage is related to air pollution and other factors. Despite much controversy there exists no doubt that air pollution stresses like 'acid rain' and enhanced N deposition affect forest soils by e.g. accelerating soil acidification. This process increases the loss of cationic nutrients such as Mg, Ca and K from the ecosystem. Therefore it is not surprising that various types of this new damage involve Mg and K deficiencies. In this context fertilizer and lime applications have proven useful mitigation tools. However, when these practices are conducted improperly, i.e. not related to site and stand conditions, ecological hazards may arise. It is therefore necessary to develop new solutions to restore soil fertility and to improve soil protection in agricultural and forest ecosystems.

AB Background: Although the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is unknown, its unique epidemiology suggests that an infectious, sexually transmitted agent or agents may contribute to its pathogenesis.
   Methods: To assess the natural history of KS associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and to identify factors associated with its development, data were analyzed from a multicenter, observational cohort study of 1044 persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex and a total CD4 cell count of less than 0.25 x 10(9)/L who were treated with zidovudine between April 1987 and April 1988. Records were reviewed bimonthly. Follow-up continued for 2 years or until death.
   Results: One hundred thirty-one patients (13%) had KS at study enrollment, and 143 developed KS (14%) during follow-up, with a 2-year actuarial risk of 21%. The probability of KS at 2 years for patients with initial CD4 cell counts of less than 0.1X10(9)/L was 25%, compared with 15% for those with counts of 0.1X10(9)/L or more. By logistic regression, a baseline CD4 cell count of less than 0.1x10(9)/L (relative odds, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.95), homosexuality (relative odds, 3.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.82 to 7.56), cytomegalovirus disease (relative odds, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.41), and white race (relative odds, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 2.43) were independently associated with KS. Median survival after KS was 408 days, and KS was an independent predictor of death (relative hazard, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 2.52).
   Conclusions: Kaposi's sarcoma contributes to human immunodeficiency virus-related morbidity and mortality, especially among male homosexuals. This large cohort study provides further evidence for an association between risk for cytomegalovirus infection and KS.

AB The cellular immunoincompetence which follows bone marrow transplantation (BMT) allows both primary and reactivation infection with herpes viruses. We report the overall incidence and timing of varicella tester virus (VZV) infections after BMT, including the clinical course, complications and associated clinical risk features. Of 1186 patients undergoing BMT through 1989, 216 patients developed VZV infection between 4 days and 10.8 years after BMT; 86% of them within the first 18 months. Of all patients transplanted, 15 +/- 3% by 6 months and 52 +/- 14% by 5 years had developed VZV infection, Dermatomal tester represented 62% of the infections, while 32% had complicated VZV infection - CNS, disseminated or visceral tester. All serious infections occurred within 7 months of BMT but only two patients died, both from VZV pneumonitis. Allogeneic and autologous recipients had a similar incidence of VZV infection. VZV seropositive patients had more frequent, earlier and often more complicated or disseminated infections. Age greater than or equal to 10 years and radiation in the pre-transplant conditioning were significantly and independently associated with higher rates of VZV infection within a multivariate regression model. Using this model, we could define clinical risk groups with distinctly different hazards of VZV infection: age >10 years, radiation pre-BMT and VZV seropositive patients had a 44% incidence by 3 years versus age < 10 years, no radiation and VZV seronegative had a 0% incidence by 3 years. Acyclovir assigned for prophylaxis of CMV or HSV infection had no effect on the timing or incidence of VZV infection. The frequency of VZV infection, its morbidity and occasional serious complications suggest that continuing attention to prophylactic techniques and promptly applied therapy are necessary following BMT.

   CONSEQUENCES
AB Bodies in the solar system have been bombarded by interplanetary debris throughout time. In early solar-system history, collisions between proto-planets occurred and one such impact of a Mars-sized object with the proto-Earth may have resulted in the formation of the Moon. For the first 600 million years of geological time, impact was a dominant geological process and shaped the surface and crustal evolution of the terrestrial planets. On Earth, it may also have resulted in the erosion of the atmosphere and massive excursions in temperature that affected the viability of the biosphere. As this early intense flux died off with time, impact played less of a role in planetary evolution. Occasional large-impact events by bodies in the ten kilometre size range, however, continued through the Phanerozoic and at least one resulted in a mass extinction event in the biostratigraphic record. Smaller-impact events by bodies in the one kilometre size range, which occur less than every million years, are of little danger to the global biosphere. However these impacts could severely affect or even destroy the complex infrastructure of modern human civilizations through the equivalent of a 'nuclear winter'.

TI MEDIA CONSTRUCTIONS OF RISK AND SAFETY - DIFFERENTIAL FRAMINGS OF HAZARD
   EVENTS
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-PROBLEM; DISCOURSE
AB The media play an important role in the social construction of risk and safety, In this article, we analyze how reports in a New Orleans newspaper defined the risk and safety associated with a series of four events during the summer of 1988: a drought, low water levels in the Mississippi River, a saltwater intrusion, and toxic pollution in local bodies of water. The newspaper reports defined some of the events as hazards by assessing their negative consequences and, in turn, defined them as specific kinds of hazards by identifying their causes. Specifically, we found that the reports defined the nonlocal consequences of an event as more varied and severe than its local consequences. Further, the reports consistently defined each of the events as natural events rather than attributing their causes to social or technological events or conditions. Our results suggest the importance of news sources, economic and political power, and a preference for monocausal frames in the social construction of news. Our results also suggest the importance of local cultural world views in defining hazards and risks. We use the findings to suggest avenues for future research and theory.

TI CLINICAL COURSE AND PROGNOSTIC FACTORS IN ACUTE LOW-BACK-PAIN - AN
   INCEPTION COHORT STUDY IN PRIMARY-CARE PRACTICE
SO BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID LUMBAR SPINE RADIOGRAPHS; DISABILITY; RELIABILITY
AB Objective-To describe the natural course of recent acute low back pain in terms of both morbidity (pain, disability) and absenteeism from work and to evaluate the prognostic factors for these outcomes. Design-Inception cohort study. Setting-Primary care. Patients-103 patients with acute localised nonspecific back pain lasting less than 72 hours. Main outcome measures-Complete recovery (disappearance of both pain and disability) and return to work. Results-90% of patients recovered within two weeks and only two developed chronic low back pain. Only 49 of 100 patients for whom data were available had bed rest and 40% of 75 employed patients lost no time from work. Proportional hazards regression analysis showed that previous chronic episodes of low back pain, initial disability level, initial pain worse when standing, initial pain worse when lying, and compensation status were significantly associated with delayed episode recovery. These factors were also related to absenteeism from work. Absenteeism from work was also influenced by job satisfaction and gender. Conclusions-The recovery rate from acute low back pain was much higher than reported in other studies. Those studies, however, did not investigate groups of patients enrolled shortly after the onset of symptoms and often mixed acute low back pain patients with patients with exacerbations of chronic pain or sciatica. Several sociodemographic and clinical factors were of prognostic value in acute low back pain. Factors which influenced the outcome in terms of episode recovery (mainly physical severity factors) were only partly predictive of absenteeism from work. Time off work and return to work depended more on sociodemographic and job related influences.

AB Laboratory and field studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the organophosphorus insecticide, azinphosmethyl, on bird populations and into the possibility of assessing toxic hazard by a non-destructive biomarker such as BChE inhibition. Japanese quail were treated with increasing doses of azinphos-methyl (0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg) and sacrificed 7 and 24 h later. Serum BChE and CbE, brain AChE, and liver microsomal CbE activities showed different patterns of inhibition. The maximum inhibition of BChE and CbE usually occurred 7 h after treatment, whereas the effect on AChE was greater at 24 h. A positive correlation was found between BChE and AChE, 7 and 24 h after treatment. This correlation could serve as the foundation for a theoretical model for assessing toxic hazard through non-destructive biomarkers. The only effect on brain AChE was detected in the group treated with the highest concentrations of azinphos-methyl (50 mg/kg). Fugacity model calculations showed that such massive concentrations are very unlikely to occur under natural conditions after agricultural use of the compound.
   The non-destructive biomarker was used to test a population of tree sparrows living in a cherry orchard sprayed once with azinphos-methyl. No inhibition of BChE activity was found 24 h after application, and it was therefore concluded that the concentration of the insecticide used did not constitute a hazard for the birds.

AB Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mirex, and pesticides were 10-100 times higher in migratory adult American eels, Anguilla rostrata, sampled at Kamouraska, Quebec, in 1990 than in eels from an uncontaminated reference tributary; concentrations in eels within the estuary varied little among sites. In contrast, mercury levels were the same at estuarine and reference sites, suggesting natural sources or atmospheric deposition of mercury. Dioxins, furans, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons were virtually absent at all sites. During the 7 wk of migration, levels of PCBs, mirex, and pesticides in eels increased, while mercury did not. Since 1982, levels of PCBs and mirex have declined by 68 and 56%, respectively, and the percentage of eels exceeding human health guidelines for PCBs and mirex was about twofold lower in 1990 than in 1982. Levels of other pesticides have also declined, except that dieldrin is unchanged since 1982. While chemical concentrations are declining, levels of specific, highly toxic PCB congeners are sufficiently high that eel consumption by beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) is still likely to be hazardous. The hazard to the eels themselves is unknown due to a scarcity of toxicity data, but the highest concentrations of chemicals were observed in gonads.

AB An aquatic microcosm system is described which is suitable to investigate fate and effects of pesticides and other chemicals in aquatic ecosystems under simulated conditions. The microcosm consists of a water body with a volume of 800 liter and a sediment layer including an undisturbed sediment core of 60 cm depth and 60 cm diameter. Both sediment and water are taken from natural ditches or ponds. The system is installed in a greenhouse under partly standardized conditions. For experiments the C-14-labelled test substances are used. The fate relevant parameters of a chemical, i.e. degradation, metabolism and distribution, including ground water exposure, bioavailability and accumulation in water and sediment organisms, as well as ecosystem effects are determined in a single experimental set up. Furthermore, the regeneration potential of the system after chemical stress can be studied.

AB In sensitized subjects, provocation tests to latex may induce severe systemic reactions and even anaphylactic shock. It is probable that part of the risk is due to the difficulty in grading the stimulating dose and in starting from very low levels of exposure.
   To identify the aetiological agent of work-related asthma in four nurses with previous allergic contact urticaria to latex surgical gloves dusted with cornstarch powder, we performed a specific bronchial provocation test study, based on exposure on three different days to nonpowdered latex surgical glove extract, powdered latex surgical glove extract and cornstarch powder extract, respectively. Extracts were nebulized in increasing concentrations in a 7 m(3) challenge room, in the absence of the patients. The initial extract concentration was a tenfold dilution of the predetermined skin test end-point in the individual undergoing challenge, and the highest concentration was the undiluted extract. After exposure, the patients' forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) was monitored for 2 h. If FEV(1) decreased by at least 15%, the next scheduled exposure was not carried out and FEV(1) was monitored over a period of 24 h.
   Whereas nebulization of cornstarch powder extract caused no bronchial reaction in the patients, nebulization of nonpowdered latex surgical glove extract induced immediate bronchoconstriction in two subjects as an undiluted solution, and nebulization of powdered latex surgical glove extract induced immediate bronchoconstriction in all subjects at the 1:10 dilution. No systemic reaction was elicited by the bronchial provocation challenges.
   Our results demonstrate that airborne powder from latex gloves can be an inhalative occupational hazard. Latex, absorbed by the cornstarch powder and then airborne when gloves were handled, was the causative agent of the respiratory events in our patients. The standardized method that we used minimizes the risk of eliciting systemic reactions when performing specific bronchial provocation tests to latex.

AB Background and Purpose The importance of carotid plaque ulceration as a cause of cerebral ischemic symptoms remains uncertain. Moreover, its prominence in symptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis is unknown. Methods The association between angiographically defined plaque ulceration and risk of subsequent stroke was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression in 659 patients with severe (70% to 99%) carotid stenosis from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Results Treatment assignment (medical versus surgical) and degree of ipsilateral stenosis were identified as having a significant influence on the results. The risk of ipsilateral stroke at 24 months for medically treated patients with ulcerated plaques increased incrementally from 26.3% to 73.2% as the degree of stenosis increased from 75% to 95%. For patients with no ulcer, the risk of stroke remained constant at 21.3% for all degrees of stenosis. The net result yielded relative risks of stroke (ulcer versus no ulcer) ranging from 1.24 (95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 2.52) to 3.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.49 to 7.88). Conversely, for surgically treated patients with antecedent presence of an ulcerated plaque, the risk of stroke increased slightly at the highest degrees of stenosis. Overall, carotid endarterectomy reduced the risk of ipsilateral stroke at 24 months by at least 50%. Similar results were obtained for risk of major ipsilateral stroke and risk of all strokes and death. Conclusions The presence of angiographically defined ulceration for medically treated symptomatic patients is associated with an increased risk of stroke. The risk of stroke more than doubles at higher degrees of stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy is beneficial in substantially reducing the risk of stroke, regardless of plaque ulceration and degree of severe carotid stenosis.

AB Evidence that environmental levels of vanadium are increasing has raised concern over the injection of vanadium into the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources. A simple global mass balance model was developed to demonstrate the influence of anthropogenic vanadium on the global distribution of this trace metal. Vanadium in particulate emissions owing to man's industrial activities were estimated to comprise almost-equal-to 53% of total atmosphere vanadium loading and exceeded natural continental or volcanogenic dust by only a narrow margin. Oceanic deposition of vanadium adhering to anthropogenic particles was estimated to comprise almost-equal-to 5% of total ocean vanadium loading. There is no suggestion that these inputs of anthropogenic vanadium pose a significant global environmental threat. It is entirely possible, however, that anthropogenic vanadium inputs could pose an environmental hazard given a more restricted area and a specific set of unfavorable circumstances.

AB Treadmill and clinical data were gathered prospectively on consecutive patients who underwent exercise testing for evaluation for coronary artery disease in a 1,200 bed veterans Affairs Medical Center.  From 3,609 men referred for exercise testing from 1984 to 1990, 3,134 patients remained after excluding those with significant valvular heart disease and those with prior coronary artery bypass surgery.  Of these, 588 were selected for clinical reasons to undergo cardiac catheterization within 3 months of evaluation leaving 2,546 who were not selected.  Over 3 years, there were 158 cardiovascular deaths, 99 nonfatal myocardial infarcts and 183 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.  In the total population, the Cox proportional-hazards model demonstrated the following characteristics to be statistically significant independent predictors of time until cardiovascular death: a history of congestive heart failure and/or taking digoxin, exercise-induced ST depression, the change in systolic blood pressure during exercise, and exercise capacity in METs.  Using the Cox model coefficients to weight the variables, a simple score (the Veterans Affairs Prognostic Score) was constructed based on these items.  Average annual cardiovascular mortality was plotted against the score enabling its estimation for any given patient.  In the subgroup selected for cardiac catheterization (n = 588), the mean score was greater, consistent with a poorer prognosis, compared with the total population; 53% (n = 312) had a score <-2 associated with an annual mortality <2%.  Thus, in over half of the patients selected for catheterization, the catheterization was unnecessary if performed to lessen their chance of cardiovascular death, since no intervention could improve their prognosis. Similarly, in patients selected for bypass surgery, the mean score was -0.5, which is associated with an estimated annual cardiovascular mortality of 5%.  Thirty-five percent of these patients had a score <-2.  Thus, variables available from the usual noninvasive workup of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease can be used to estimate cardiovascular mortality. Exercise-induced ST depression can be falsely excluded form predictive models because of workup bias.  This score can estimate cardiovascular mortality in male veterans being evaluated for stable coronary artery disease, obviating the need for cardiac catheterization in many of them.

AB Objective: To characterize the progression to HIV-1 disease among injection drug users (IDU) according to laboratory markers. D
   Design: Prospective study of cohort of HIV-1-seroprevalent IDU, with case-comparison component.
   Methods: Different laboratory markers were examined as predictors of progression to HIV-1-associated diseases including AIDS in a cohort of 318 HIV-1-infected IDU. The cohort was enrolled from a methadone treatment program in the Bronx, New York, USA. The independent utility of non-CD4 cell markers was evaluated after adjustment for the association of low CD4 lymphocyte count with AIDS risk. Clinical events in the natural history of HIV-1 were related to changes in levels of two variables related to duration of infection, CD4 lymphocyte count and serum beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M) concentration.
   Results: On univariate analysis, AIDS incidence measured from baseline increased with declining CD4 lymphocyte number and percentage, increasing serum beta(2)M level, low platelet count, low leukocyte count and p24 antigenemia. Among HIV-1-related outcomes prior to any AIDS diagnosis, the relative risk of pyogenic bacterial infections conferred by these markers was similar to the relative risk of AIDs. For all HIV-1 outcomes, the elevated risk encountered at CD4 lymphocyte number less than or equal to 200 x 10(6)/l was entirely due to the high risk at less than or equal to 150 x 10(6)/l. On multivariate analysis, control for CD4 lymphocyte count eliminated the association of any other marker with increased AIDS hazard. HIV-1-related outcomes tended to occur in this order: multiple constitutional symptoms, oral candidiasis, pyogenic bacterial infections of AIDS.
   Conclusions: In HIV-1-infected IDU, several laboratory markers may predict AIDS when analyzed individually. These are not, however, independently related to increased AIDS risk after adjustment for low CD4 lymphocyte count. A CD4 count less than or equal to 150 x 10(6)/l is more strongly related to immediate risk of adverse outcome than a count of 200 x 10(6)/l. A progressive series of clinical events is associated with markers of duration of HIV-1 infection, prior to and including AIDS diagnosis.

AB Differences in age at natural menopause by occupation, education, and place of residence were examined using a cross-sectional population sample of Finnish women aged 45-64 years (n = 1,713, response rate 86%). The sample was selected at random from the Finnish Population Register in 1989 (final n = 1,505, 75%). Kaplan-Meier estimates showed the median age at natural menopause to be 51 years for all women (95% confidence interval (Cl) 50.6-51.4). The median menopausal age of smokers and nulliparous women was 50 years; that of nonsmokers and women whose first full-term pregnancy occurred before the age of 25 years was 52 years. Differences between occupational and educational groups were statistically significant (Mantel-Cox test for occupation, p < 0.02; for education, p < 0.03). In the Cox proportional hazards model, the odds ratio of the occurrence of natural menopause among upper white-collar women was 0.74 (95% Cl 0.57-0.96) and among the most educated women (education > 11 years) it was 0.75 (95% Cl 0.59-0.96), adjusted to reflect smoking, use of hormones, body mass index, and age at first full-term pregnancy. Sociodemographic variables appear to be associated with age at natural menopause in a representative sample of Finnish women.

TI RESISTANCE POTENTIAL OF FORESTS AND INTEGRATED GEOGRAPHIC
   INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
SO EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA English
DT Article
AB The resistance potential of forest stands against natural harmful factors is determined by: the degree of forest site pertinence of the tree species composition, the stand spatial structure and the sanitary quotient of a stand. The basic unit for ascertaining of it is a stand, which does not provide sufficient information in a mountain environment.
   Several hazard rating systems, based on similar principles as the resistance potential of forest stands, have been developed in the United States, Canada and Russia. Some use information obtained by remote sensing or integrated geographic information systems.
   Mapping the indicators of resistance potential of forests is possible at classification units smaller than stands.
   It is concluded that creation of the maps of the resistance potential of forests is possible. Combining information obtained by remote sensing with available maps and from other data sources in integrated geographic information systems would probably be the best way.

AB Early-life-stage (ELS) toxicity tests were conducted to determine the effect of selected water temperatures on the toxicity of 4-nitrophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). NOECs were determined for growth and mortality at selected time intervals and water temperatures of 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C. As tests progressed, NOECs leveled to constant time-independent values that were similar for tests at each temperature. In 4-nitrophenol tests, the time-independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C, respectively, were 1. 16, 1.20, and 1. 16 mg/L for growth and 3.40, 3.38, and 2.20 mg/L for mortality. For 2,4-dinitrophenol, time-independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17-degrees-C, respectively, were 1.07, 0.50, and 0.80 mg/L for growth and 1.30, 1.89, and 1.60 mg/L for mortality. Temperature did, however, affect the rate at which time-independent NOECs were reached. More time was required to reach time-independent NOECs as temperature decreased. For example, the time-independent NOEC in 4-nitrophenol tests at 17-degrees-C was reached in 14 d, whereas it required 42 d at 7-degrees-C. The effect of temperature on toxicity must be considered in hazard assessment protocols to assess risk accurately and protect aquatic organisms adequately. Chronic toxicity tests are necessary to assess risk because acute toxicity tests cannot provide the information necessary to predict the long-term effects of factors such as temperature in natural environments.

AB The time interval between onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of cancer [symptom to diagnosis interval (SDI), or duration of symptoms] is a highly complex variable reflecting patient behaviour, the clinical course, the functioning of the health system and tumour biology. In order to assess possible forms of the risk function of SDI upon cancer survival whilst taking into account the effects of age, sex, tumour site and stage at diagnosis, 1887 symptomatic cases of lung, breast, stomach, colon, rectal, bladder cancer and lymphomas registered in the Tumour Registry of the Hospital del Mar (Barcelona) were analysed by means of survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. Subjects (mean age 64 years) were followed for a median length of 15 months after diagnosis (follow-up rate 93.5%). SDI showed a weak relationship with tumour stage at diagnosis and with survival: out of the seven sites studied, only in breast cancer was tumour extension at diagnosis significantly influenced by duration of symptoms, and only lung and rectal cancers showed a detectable form of the risk function of SDI upon survival; neither was linear, and for rectal cancer the relationship was complexly related with tumour stage. Hence, results show that forms of the risk function of duration of symptoms on cancer survival are specific to tumour sites, and that the interval should not be represented as a linear, continuous term. Studies analysing more complex sets of factors, processes and forms of the SDI function are needed.

AB The hypothesis tested in this study is that neighborhoods with multiple technological and behavioral hazards have lower-quality ratings than do neighborhoods with a single massive technological hazard. More than 280 households were surveyed in a heavily industrialized eight-square-kilometer area southwest of Philadelphia. Respondents who gave a low rating to the area listed multiple hazards, especially crime, as distressing characteristics. Respondents who characterized the area as excellent or good rated their previous neighborhood as poor. Geographical theory should explain how different populations perceive behavioral, technological, and natural hazards at the neighborhood scale.

TI GIANT SEA-BED POCKMARKS - EVIDENCE FOR GAS ESCAPE FROM BELFAST BAY,
   MAINE
SO GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EARTHQUAKE; SHELF
AB Circular depressions, or pockmarks, cover the sea floor in many estuarine regions of the western Gulf of Maine. In Belfast Bay, Maine, they are found in densities up to 160/km2, are up to 350 m in diameter and 35 m in relief, and are among the largest and deepest known. The pockmarks appear to form from the escape of biogenic natural gas and pore water and are far larger than features associated with thermogenic gas elsewhere. These pockmarks are thought to have formed (1) catastrophically during an earthquake, tsunami, or storm, or (2) slowly over thousands of years. Recent observations of bubble releases suggest continuing activity and a potential geologic hazard. The pockmarks involve a poorly documented coastal process of sediment redistribution and methane release, largely unrecognized in the rock record but widespread in middle- to high-latitude embayments.

TI SOME FUNCTIONS AND PROPERTIES OF INFORMATION (REPRINTED FROM ENGN SCI
   EDUC JOURNAL, AUG, 1993)
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB It can be observed that the essential function of information in nature is to control and thereby operate the organisation of life.  Such organisation is recursively defined so that it refers to the operations of life at every scale, microscopic organisms, vital organs, animals, social groups of animals including commercial firms, interdependent species, and the entire biosphere.  It follows that the natural structure and behaviour of sets of symbols used to represent information are characterised by the interplay of recursively defined order and intrinsic disorder arising from physical uncertainty in the behaviour of very small objects in the control mechanisms of life.  Recognition and acceptance of such features of the nature of information offers useful guidance to information system designers in their selection of strategic objectives, e.g. to reduce the hazards of program development by minimising the gross multiplicity of details that must be correct for a program to operate as intended.

AB Future manned missions beyond low earth orbit require accurate predictions of the risk to astronauts and to critical systems from exposure to ionizing radiation. For low-level exposures, the hazards are dominated by rare single-event phenomena where individual cosmic-ray particles or spallation reactions result in potentially catastrophic changes in critical components. Examples might be a biological lesion leading to cancer in an astronaut or a memory upset leading to an undesired rocket firing. The risks of such events appears to depend on the amount of energy deposited within critical sensitive volumes of biological cells and microelectronic components. The critical environmental information needed to estimate the risks posed by the natural space environments, including solar flares, is the number of times more than a threshold amount of energy for an event will be deposited in the critical microvolumes. These predictions are complicated by uncertainties in the natural environments, particularly the composition of flares, and by the effects of shielding. Microdosimetric data for large numbers of orbits are needed to improve the environmental models and to test the transport codes used to predict event rates.

TI NEW SAFETY ISSUES WHEN MOVING FROM LIQUID FUELS TO NATURAL-GAS
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural gas (NG) is produced whenever organic matter is decomposed in the absence of oxygen. The main constituent of natural gas is methane. In contrast to liquid fuels, methane has a boiling point far below normal ambient temperatures. Even the critical temperature is well below ambient. Therefore natural gas must be stored either as compressed natural gas (CNG) at very high pressures at ambient temperatures, or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) at very low temperatures. The basic safety issues are caused by loss of confinement of either CNG or LNG. In both cases the issues are: global greenhouse effects of natural gas (methane); local fire and explosion hazards; and local asphyxiation hazard due to reduced oxygen content in the atmosphere breathed when air is mixed with methane.

AB The main health hazard of atherosclerosis is coronary heart disease (CHD). Its relation to nutrition (chiefly saturated fat) was shown through the Seven Countries Study and confirmed by between country comparisons. Nevertheless, cholesterol, the accepted intermediate link in blood, can no longer be used to explain differences between countries. In addition, when previous trials to decrease CHD by diet were efficient, rapid protection was observed (within a year), an effect not attributed to atherosclerosis but to thrombosis, which is responsible for myocardial infarction. Thrombogenesis is directly increased by saturated fat, but decreased only by n-3 fatty acids and alcohol through decreasing platelet reactivity. A Mediterranean diet with more cereals, vegetables, fruit, less saturated fats and more n-3 fatty acids has recently been shown to afford a rapid and exceptional protection from recurrences and death in coronary patients. The relationship between nutrition and CHD is thus as close as suggested, but more complex, because of additional nutrients, such as alcohol and natural antioxidants, and an appropriate balance between fatty acids.

AB In this paper I developed a new class of discrete-time, discrete-covariate models for modeling nonproportionality in event-history data within the log-multiplicative framework. The models specify nonproportionality in hazards to ba a log-multiplicative product of two components: a nonproportionality patterns over time and a nonproportionality level per group. Illustrated with data from the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study (Rogot et al. 1988) and from the 1980 June Current Population Survey (Wu and Tuma 1990), the log-multiplicative models are shown to be natural generalizations of proportional hazards models and should be applicable to a wide range of research areas.

TI HAZARD RATE AND OBSERVED COVARIATES - A NATURAL WAY OF PARAMETRIZATION
SO STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of parametrization of the conditional survival function in the case of partially observed randomly changing covariates is considered. The general formula for a hazard rate as a function of the value of the observed covariate in the case of one measurement is derived for a wide class of stochastic processes associated with covariates. When covariates are described by the Gauss-Markov type stochastic process, the conditional Gaussian property of the distribution of the unobservables is used to get the parametric specification of the hazard rate as a function of observed covariates.

AB We studied 187 patients who presented with mild congenital aortic valve stenosis or a bicuspid aortic valve without stenosis at presentation; 63% were males. Information on all clinical events was obtained, and patients were traced to assess current clinical status. Results:The median age at presentation was 2 years (range, 0-15). Additional cardiac lesions occurred in 51 patients, more commonly in patients presenting under 1 year of age (P < 0.0001). The median duration of follow-up was 10 years (range, 1-28); seven patients were lost to follow-up. Thirty-two patients progressed to require intervention (28 surgical, five balloon valvuloplasty) at a median age of 10.5 years. No patient who presented with a bicuspid aortic valve required intervention. Two patients developed endocarditis. There were eight deaths; four after surgery for aortic stenosis and four due to other cardiac lesions. There were no sudden deaths. Actuarial and hazard analysis showed that progression beyond mild stenosis was closely related to duration of follow-up. Conclusions: Congenital aortic valve stenosis is most frequently mild at presentation. Progression is related to duration of follow-up. Fewer than 20% of patients are likely to still have mild stenosis after 30 years. Follow-up into adult life is essential.

TI THE NATURAL-HISTORY OF BORDERLINE ISOLATED SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION
SO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; MEN; RISK; DISEASE; TRIAL; DEATH
AB Background. Patients with isolated systolic hypertension are at increased risk for cardiovascular disorders. We attempted to determine whether those with borderline isolated systolic hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 to 159 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg) have a greater risk of progression to definite (more severe) hypertension and of major morbid or fatal events than people with normal blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg).
   Methods. A total of 2767 of the original participants in the Framingham Heart Study were monitored with biennial examinations for up to 34 years for the development of definite hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater-than-or-equal-to 160 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure of greater-than-or-equal-to 90 mm Hg, or the initiation of antihypertensive therapy) and for major cardiovascular events.
   Results. Borderline isolated systolic hypertension was the most common type of untreated hypertension among adults over the age of 60. After 20 years of follow-up, 80 percent of those with borderline isolated systolic hypertension had progression to definite hypertension, as compared with 45 percent of the normotensive participants (P<0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, participants with borderline isolated systolic hypertension had an excess long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 147; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 1.74) and death from cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 2.00), as compared with normotensive participants. In an analysis of pooled data from biennial examinations to study short-term sequelae, subjects with borderline isolated systolic hypertension had an increased risk of progression to definite hypertension (odds ratio, 3.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.35 to 4.41) and of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio, 1.39; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.82).
   Conclusions. In both the short term and the long term, subjects with borderline isolated systolic hypertension are at increased risk of progression to definite hypertension and the development of cardiovascular disease.

AB In a prospective cohort of 2,647 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive homosexual men enrolled in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh, 891 developed clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) between June 1984 and January 1992. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine temporal trends in survival after AIDS for specific diagnoses, controlling for level of immunosuppression at diagnosis, age, race, and geographic location. Median survival time following AIDS onset increased from 11.6 months in 1984-1985 to 19.5 months in 1988-1989; for those diagnosed in 1990-1991, the median survival time dropped to 17.2 months. Trends in improved survival were diagnosis-specific. Survival after Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia consistently improved from 1984 to 1991 (p < 0.001). Compared with men diagnosed in 1984-1985, those diagnosed with P. carinii pneumonia in 1990-1991 had one-tenth the hazard of dying. For men with greater than or equal to 100 helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ cells) when diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, the relative hazards (95% confidence intervals) of dying after Kaposi's sarcoma were 0.8 (0.42-1.60) in 1986-1987, 0.7 (0.34-1.58) in 1988-1989, and 0.6 (0.19-1.61) in 1990-1991 compared with those diagnosed before 1986. Men with <100 CD4+ cells when diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma did not demonstrate a consistent change in their subsequent survival. After a nonsignificant (p > 0.05) initial improvement in prognosis, there has not been a significant improvement in survival for men who presented with other opportunistic infections. Observed increases in overall survival probably relate to improved treatment of patients who develop P. carinii pneumonia.

AB Forty pregnant F1 crossbred cows (20 Holstein-Friesian X Boran and 20 Simmental X Boran) were assigned to a 2 X 2 (work X diet) factorial experiment as follows: supplemented-non-working (SNW), supplemented-working (SW), non-supplemented-non-working (NSNW) and non-supplemented-working (NSW). Working cows pulled sledges 100 days/year (pull = 350 to 450 N, 4 h/day, 4 days/week). Conception and oestrus at fixed times (200 and 365 days post partum) were analysed using linear logistic models. Proportional hazard models were used for analysing 'failure' time data such as time to first oestrus or time to conception. Diet supplementation significantly decreased days to first oestrus and days to conception in non-working and working cows. SW cows had similar reproductive performance to NSNW cows. In supplemented cows, work significantly delayed days to conception. However, by 365 days post partum, conception rate was similar for SNW and SW cows. Body condition at calving significantly affected post-partum reproductive ability of non-working and working cows. Natural grass hay alone could not support potential reproductive ability of crossbred cows. Work output of supplemented cows may be associated with longer calving intervals. The economic trade-offs between longer calving intervals and work output should be examined in detail.

TI MODELING PATTERNS OF CHANGE WITH AGE AS A RISK FACTOR OF DISEASE AND

ID LONGITUDINAL DATA
AB Past research has shown that human development is characterized by varying patterns of change in individual characteristics as a person grows older. Longitudinal studies have emerged as the only way to study these different patterns of change or aging. This paper discusses analytical methods for studying longitudinal data and statistical models for investigating age-related patterns of change as a risk factor for morbidity or mortality. First, methods and models for analyzing longitudinal data are presented with particular attention paid to the assumptions of the models. The three approaches discussed are the >>naively-pooled<< approach, the two-stage approach, and an approach using the linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures data. The model for this final approach most adequately meets the requirements of longitudinal data, allowing for the natural heterogeneity among subjects and providing for a correlation structure for repeated observations across time. Second, three other approaches using the results from the mixed-effects model are discussed for assessing the risk of age-related changes in relation to a subsequent outcome of morbidity or mortality. The first method simply includes variables in the mixed-effects model to account for the age-related differences, the second relates the values of the random effects representing the individual variability to the outcome, and the final approach uses predicted values calculated from the mixed-effects model as covariates in a time-dependent proportional hazards model to investigate the relationship of change with the outcome of interest.

AB A mechanism of aging is proposed for mammals and other vertebrates. In this mechanism, most somatic cells have inherent deficiencies in methylation metabolism with respect to their capacity to methylate DNA. This leads to incomplete DNA methylation in each cell cycle which, accumulated over many cell cycles, contributes to genetic instability, senescence and cancer. These proposed metabolic deficiencies are present from the time somatic cells are young, yet it is only after many cell divisions that deleterious effects are realized. In nature, most animals have reproduced or have been killed by predators or other environmental hazards before they can be greatly affected by these deficiencies. These deficiencies evolved in animals eating a balance of nutrients from nature.
   Evidence from the literature is reviewed which establishes that methylation is lost from the DNA of many mammalian somatic cells as they age both in vivo and in vitro, and that DNA methylation levels are influenced by factors, such as diet, that affect methylation metabolism. Partially correcting the proposed deficiencies is considered as a possible molecular mechanism by which caloric restriction extends lifespan. Other possible dietary and transgenic means to correct the proposed deficiencies and extend lifespan are discussed.

AB Minority and lower socioeconomic communities face disproportionate exposure to the growing threat from natural environment hazards such as toxic waste. The author places an expanding field of social work practice in the context of the Profession's historic commitment to social welfare, justice, and equity. She describes specialized knowledge, the application of social work skills, ethical issues, and strategies for integrating environmental equity into practica training in a framework for field education. In addition, she examines opportunities for social work educators and students to contribute to the resolution of environmental hazard, across multiple intervention levels, for foundation and concentration practica.

AB Hepatotoxic microcystins produced by cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes represent a significant health hazard to humans and agricultural livestock. Liquid chromatography (LC)-linked protein phosphatase (PPase) bioassay analysis of blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa produced in a Canadian drinking water lake identified several PPase inhibitors with significantly greater hydrophobicity than microcystin-LR, based on their retention time on C,, reverse phase LC columns. Seven PPase inhibitors were purified to homogeneity by bioassay-guided fractionation involving Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and two-step reverse phase at pH 6.5 and 2.0. One of the PPase inhibitors, isolated in a final yield of 1.5 mu g/g lyophilized cyanobacteria, was identified as microcystin-ll by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. A further PPase inhibitor (20 ng/g cyanobacteria) was identified as microcystin-LL but with D-Ala replaced by an unknown amino acid. Four PPase inhibitors ( < 20 ng/g cyanobacteria) were characterized by amino acid analysis and identified as microcystin-LV, -LM, -LF and -LZ (where Z represents an unknown hydrophobic amino acid). A further microcystin was also identified (< 10 ng/g cyanobacteria) in which arginine was apparently absent. The biological activity of the seven microcystins as inhibitors of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1c) was compared with microcystin-LR and motuporin (a hydrophobic analogue of nodularin). All of the compounds inhibited PP-1c with IC50 values of 0.06-0.4 nM, consistent with their identification as microcystins. These findings further demonstrate the applicability of a sensitive PPase bioassay for the identification of variant microcystins in the natural environment.

AB The loss of CD4 lymphocytes is known to be an important component of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis. It remains unclear, however, whether the importance of the CD4 lymphocyte count is such that individuals who have been infected for widely different lengths of time, but for whom the CD4 lymphocyte count is the same, have the same risk of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The authors directly addressed this question for 111 HIV-1-infected hemophiliacs who had been followed for up to 12 years from seroconversion and for whom a median of 16 CD4 lymphocyte counts had been made. Thirty-eight patients had developed AIDS by January 1, 1992. As of August 1, 1985, the time from sero-conversion to AIDS ranged from 3 weeks to almost 6 years. The risk of AIDS increased with time from seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.25 per year; p = 0.09). CD4 lymphocyte count was strongly related to time from seroconversion and also to the risk of AIDS (relative hazard = 3.25 per 100/mm(3); p < 0.00005). In a bivariate Cox regression model, the relative hazard for time from seroconversion fell markedly towards unity (1.05; p = 0.7), while that for CD4 lymphocyte count remained unchanged. This suggests that time from seroconversion is a relevant factor in HIV-1 infection only insofar as it provides information as to the probable degree of loss of CD4 lymphocytes. If the number of these cells is known, time from seroconversion seems to be of little additional value in assessing the risk of AIDS. This finding has implications for the clinical assessment of individual patient prognosis, for the design of epidemiologic studies of HIV-1 infection, and for our understanding of how HIV-1 causes disease.

AB Objectives-To evaluate the role of a treadmill stress test for identifying patients at risk of recurrent ischaemic events after acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis.
   Background-The natural history of myocardial infarction has changed with the introduction of thrombolytic treatment; there is a lower mortality but a higher incidence of recurrent thrombotic events (reinfarction, unstable angina). The treadmill stress continues to be recommended for risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction even though its value has never been formally reassessed in the thrombolytic era.
   Methods-Prospective observational study in which 256 consecutive patients who presented with acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis underwent an early treadmill stress test and were followed up for 10 (range 6-12) months.
   Results-Recurrent ischaemic events occurred in 41 patients (unstable angina 15, reinfarction 21, death five) and a further 21 required revascularisation. Both ST depression at a low workload and low exercise tolerance (<7 metabolic equivalents of the task (METS) were predictive of recurrent events, with respective hazard ratios of 1.93 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.17-3.20; p < 0.01)) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.0-2.78; p < 0.05). These variables identified 50% and 70% of patients who subsequently sustained a recurrent ischaemic event, but the corresponding values for positive predictive accuracy were only 26% and 21%. Thus they are of limited value as a screening measure for identifying patients likely to benefit from invasive investigation and revascularisation. None of the other variables (ST elevation, haemodynamic responses, ventricular extrasystoles, angina) was significantly associated with recurrent ischaemic events.
   Conclusions-The treadmill stress test is of limited value for identifying patients at risk of recurrent ischaemic events after acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis.

TI AN ANALYSIS OF RISK-FACTORS FOR DEATH AND MODE-SPECIFIC DEATH AFTER

AB From September 1967 to January 1990, a total of 2100 patients underwent 2366 aortic valve replacements with a variety of allograft, xenograft, and mechanical valves. Concomitant procedures were performed in 764 patients. Actuarial survival at 12 years was 59.6% (70% confidence limits 57.8% to 61.4%). Hazard function for death was highest immediately after operation, falling to merge with a slowly rising phase of risk at approximately 3 months. Actuarial freedom from sudden death at 12 years was 88.0% (70% confidence limits 86.7% to 89.3%). The shape of the hazard function for sudden death was similar to that for death. Actuarial freedom from death with cardiac failure at 12 years was 87.9% (70% confidence limits 86.5% to 89.2%). The shape of the hazard function for death with cardiac failure was also similar to that for death. Risk factor analysis revealed the important deleterious impact on long-term survival resulting from impaired left ventricular structure and function because of aortic valve disease. No current-era valve used in this study (allograft, xenograft, or mechanical) was a risk factor for death. Both aortic wall disease and endocarditis necessitating aortic valve replacement substantially decreased long-term patient survival. Aortic valve replacement is advisable much earlier in the natural history of aortic valve disease before secondary left ventricular damage occurs.

AB Much attention has recently been brought to the fact that many natural components of the diet are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic. Approximately 2700 distinct chemical entities, chemical mixtures, and plant extracts are allowed as direct food additives by the US F.D.A. These include chemicals found in the body, natural components of foods, and synthetic chemicals. In addition to the chemicals among these additives that are mutagenic, there are a number of mutagens that are normally present in the plant products that are consumed as part of the normal diets. The mutagenicity in Salmonella of these food additives was identified using the National Toxicology Program and US E.P.A. Gene-Tox databases. Relatively few of the chemicals deliberately added to foods have been tested for mutagenicity. Among the chemicals tested, approximately 15% were mutagenic in Salmonella. The mutagens include both organic and inorganic substances. Many of the natural plant components, such as flavonoids, hydrazides, and tannins also have been shown to be mutagenic. However, these natural components are not considered as food additives. A large proportion of the mutagenic food additives appear to act through the generation of oxygen- or free radicals. Although the relationships between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of electrophilic chemicals has been well studied, the potential hazard of low-level increases in free-radical generating substances on tumor incidences is unknown.

AB We compare fixed behavior patterns and estimate associated risk of predation for eight populations of Aedes triseriatus at different levels of hunger, produced by manipulation of food availability prior to the test. Activity patterns (frequencies of browsing, filtering, resting, and thrashing) varied significantly among populations, but did not differ significantly between populations from sympatry with the predator Toxorhynchites rutilus vs those from allopatry to this predator. Activity patterns were affected by hunger, with increasing hunger associated with decreasing thrashing and resting, and increasing browsing. Food affected activity in all populations in a similar fashion. Estimates of risk of predation associated with activity patterns varied significantly among populations, but did not differ significantly between sympatric vs allopatric A. triseriatus. Risk associated with activity patterns increased with increasing hunger. Patterns of positions occupied (bottom, middle, wall, and surface) also varied significantly among populations, but again did not differ significantly between populations from sympatry with Toxorhynchites rutilus vs those from allopatry to this predator. Positions were affected by food, however the effects of food on positions differed significantly among populations. Estimated risk of predation associated with positions varied among populations, but did not differ between sympatric and allopatric populations. Hunger affected risk associated with positions in early instars, but the effect was not consistent across populations. Hunger had no effect on risk associated with positions in late instar larvae. Although there are pronounced behavioral differences among populations, these differences are not associated with presence/absence of T. rutilus, hence are unlikely to be products of natural selection by predation. Hunger affects behavior and increases risk Of predation, primarily via changes in activity pattern. Activity pattern changes with hunger more consistently that does position.

AB Toxins produced by marine phytoplankton represent a severe global health hazard to humans that eat seafood and are also responsible for massive natural fish kills in specialized bloom situations. Tumour-promoting hepatotoxins from the freshwater microcystin/nodularin class were identified in Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Eastern Canadian and European mussels for the first time. These hepatotoxins were detected at biologically active levels up to three-fold higher than accepted quarantine levels for the diarrhetic shellfish toxin okadaic acid (OA), based on their activity (in microcystin-LR equivalent units) in a liquid chromatography (LC)-linked protein phosphatase bioassay. The presence of microcystins/nodularins in oceanic shellfish identifies a potentially novel class of intoxication which is also prevalent in other forms of marine aquatic life, namely sponges and fish. The widespread presence of prokaryotic microcystins and nodularins in the marine environment may be indicative of the importance of signal transduction pathways involving potent inhibition of protein phosphatases in early marine eukaryotes.

TI MODELING THE CONSUMERS DECISION TO REPLACE DURABLE GOODS - A HAZARD
   FUNCTION-APPROACH
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS

DT Article
ID DURATION
AB This article analyses the consumer's durable good replacement decision using hazard models. In contrast to the typical limited dependent variable model often used in durable good demand studies, hazard models allow for much richer relationships between the ages of durable goods and the probabilities of their replacement. To illustrate the technique, a recursive system consisting of a regression equation and a hazard model is used to examine home heating system replacement decisions by residential customers of a major southeastern US electric utility. The results indicate that overall system replacement rates decline over time, and that the probability of replacement for specific households depends negatively on the age of the head of household and the availability of natural gas, and positively on system age and higher than expected household energy use.

DT Article
AB Nuclear power plants may be sited in underground caverns, on slopes, or in pits. When a possible site is being considered, geoengineering and rock mechanical factors must be considered with respect to the feasibility of construction and the protective effect of the surrounding rocks as a barrier against internal accidents and external hazards.
   The Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources carried out a preliminary evaluation of suitable sites in Germany in the 1980's using geoengineering and rock mechanical criteria. Three suitable rock types were defined: quartzite, schist and New Red Sandstone. These theoretical studies must be supplemented by in situ measurements, especially with respect to the efficiency of the rock as a geological barrier.

ID DEBRIS FLOW
AB A numerical model is used to simulate channelized lahars, flowing with a near-constant sediment concentration and volume. Water and debris are usually mobilized in short times and the peak discharge of lahars may reach many thousands of cubic meters per second in a few minutes. A relation for the energy dissipation term must be provided in the model, which in turn depends on debris flow rheology and shape and status of channel bed. A discussion of the form of this term is performed through the simulation of some historical (among the well-documented) lahars and lahar-runout flows with concentrations ranging in a wide spectrum up to 70 percent by volume and irregularly shaped sand and coarser particles dispersed in a fluid matrix of water and fine material. As concentration increases and turbulence decreases, the dissipative term, which, in the first case, is proportional to the square average flow velocity (Manning or Chezy formulation) is well described by a linear dependence on flow velocity, as expected in the laminar case. The numerical reproduction of the examined historical cases suggests that the model can be used for hazard assessment, if some hypotheses are made about lahar hydrograph at the source, its volume, and the shape of the dissipative term.

AB The People's Republic of China suffers each year from various environmental hazards. Although risk perception study has a 40-year history in Europe and North America, little is known about risk perception in China. Previous studies of risk perception have primarily focused on unnatural hazards, but China has experinced many natural environmental hazards. Therefore, the Chinese public's perceptions of environmental hazard risks must be considered in order to support the IDNDR program. The Chinese public's perceptions of environmental hazards are similar to those of Europeans and North Americans, but different characteristics are observed.

AB Objectives: We evaluated recurrence and survival for 68 patients with malignant melanoma who participated in a 6-week structured psychiatric group intervention 5 to 6 years earlier, shortly after their diagnosis and initial surgical treatment. We also explored the role of several factors as possible predictors of outcome.
   Design: This was a randomized controlled experimental study. The Cox proportion hazards regression model was used to quantify the relationship between treatment and the outcomes adjusted by the covariates (age, sex, Breslow depth, tumor site baseline Profile of Mood States Total Mood Disturbance, baseline active-behavioral coping, baseline natural killer cell activity, and treatment lie, group intervention]). The stepwise procedure was used for covariate selection.
   Results: For control patients, there was a trend for recurrence (13/34) and a statistically significant greater rate of death (10/34) than for experimental patients (7/34 and 3/34, respectively). We found that being male and having a greater Breslow depth predicted greater recurrence and poorer survival. Analysis of multiple covariates found that only Breslow depth and treatment (ie, group intervention) were significant. Adjusting for Breslow depth, treatment effect remained significant. Finally, baseline affective distress and baseline coping were significant psychobehavioral predictors for recurrence and survival. Surprisingly, higher levels of baseline distress as well as baseline coping and enhancement of active-behavioral coping over time were predictive of lower rates of recurrence and death.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric interventions that enhance effective coping and reduce affective distress appear to have beneficial effects on survival but are not proposed as an alternative or independent treatment for cancer or any other illness or disease. However, the exact nature of this relationship warrants further investigation.

AB Background. The outcome of radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer depends on many pretreatment variables that are interrelated in complex ways. A multivariate analysis of 874 cases of prostate cancer treated between 1966 and 1988 was conducted. The median length of the follow-up period after radiation therapy was 6.7 years.
   Methods. The disease outcome and rate of survival was analyzed with the proportional hazards model for patients with stage A2(104), stage B(168), or stage C(602) prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy as the only primary treatment.
   Results. Local recurrence rates were 12%, 24%, and 33% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. In multivariate analysis, stage (A2 vs. B + C) and pathologic grade (1 + 2 vs 3 + 4) were independently related to local recurrence. At 10 years local control had been achieved in 79% of favorable cases (stage AZ or stage B/C, grade 1), but in only 62% of unfavorable cases (stage B/C, grade 4). Metastatic relapse rates were 25%, 38%, and 47% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Factors that independently correlated with metastasis were high pathologic grade, transurethral resection in stage C elevated acid phosphatase levels, and being 60 years of age or younger. A favorable group of cases (stage A2/B, grade 1 or stage C, grade 1, no transurethral resection, older than 60 years of age) had a metastatic rate of only 10% after 10 years, whereas an unfavorable group (largely stage C, grades 3/4) had a metastatic rate approaching 70%. The overall survival rate was 77%, 49%, and 32% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Pathologic grade (1 vs 2 + 3 vs 4) and transurethral resection in stage C correlated with survival. A favorable group of patients (stage A2/B or stage C and grade 1) had a normal survival expectation of 15 Years. An unfavorable group consisting of grade 4 tumors had a survival rate of less than 20% at 10 years.
   Conclusions. The complexity and long natural history of prostate cancer demand careful stratification and follow-up examination to evaluate treatment results. The study of adjuvants to improve the local effectiveness of radiation and to mitigate the high metastatic rates in unfavorable local disease are urgent priorities.

AB Background. The goal of the report was to study the long-term incidence and the independent predictors for chronic atrial fibrillation and stroke in 507 paced patients with sick sinus syndrome, adjusting for differences in baseline clinical variables with multivariate analysis.
   Methods and Results. From 1980 to 1989, we implanted 376 dual-chamber, 19 atrial, and 112 ventricular pacemakers to treat patients with sick sinus syndrome. After a maximum follow-up of 134 months (mean: 59+/-38 months for chronic atrial fibrillation, 65+/-37 months for stroke), actuarial incidence of chronic atrial fibrillation was 7% at 1 year, 16% at 5 years, and 28% at 10 years. Independent predictors for this event, from Cox's proportional hazards model, were history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P<.001; hazard ratio [HR] = 16.84), use of antiarrhythmic drugs before pacemaker implant (P<.001; HR=2.25), ventricular pacing mode (P=.003; HR=1.98), age (P=.005; HR=1.03), and valvular heart disease (P=.008; HR=2.05). For patients with preimplant history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, independent predictors were prolonged episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P<.001; HR=2.56), long history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P=.004; HR=2.05), ventricular pacing mode (P=.025; HR=1.69), use of antiarrhythmic drugs before pacemaker implant (P=.024; HR=1.71), and age (P=.04; HR=1.02). Actuarial incidence of stroke was 3% at 1 year, 5% at 5 years, and 13% at 10 years. Independent predictors for stroke were history of cerebrovascular disease (P<.001; HR=5.22), ventricular pacing mode (P=.008; HR=2.61), and history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P=.037; HR=2.81).
   Conclusions. Development of chronic atrial fibrillation and stroke in paced patients with sick sinus syndrome are strongly determined by clinical variables and secondarily by the pacing modality. Ventricular pacing mode predicts chronic atrial fibrillation in patients with preimplant paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but not in those without it.

AB We report the results of a statistical analysis of the long-term outcome of 54 patients with 72 unruptured cerebral aneurysms, and identify the factors for predicting subsequent ruptures. Twenty-two patients died during the observation period, which averaged 43.7 months. The 5-year survival rate was 56%. Aneurysms ruptured in 11 patients (20.4%), 10 of whom died without undergoing surgery. The annual bleeding rate was 1.92%. The average size of the 11 ruptured aneurysms was 13.1 mm. In 4 patients, however, bleeding occurred in unruptured cerebral aneurysms of 4 and 5 mm, which suggests that leaving unruptured cerebral aneurysms of less than 10 mm in size untreated is hazardous. According to the Cox proportional hazards model, the shape and location of the aneurysm and the presence of hypertension were the most important factors for predicting a subsequent rupture. Our data suggest that unruptured cerebral aneurysms arising from the vertebrobasilar and middle cerebral arteries of 10-19 mm size and of multilobes had a statistically high probability of subsequent bleeding. Although 20 patients with 28 unruptured cerebral aneurysms were followed through repeated examinations, we could not correlate the risk of subsequent bleeding with changes in the size of the aneurysm.

AB A total of 100 workers, 86 from the glass-fibre-reinforced plastics (GRP) industry, 11 from polystyrene production and 3 from polyester resin coating manufacture, were examined for occupational skin hazards and for evaluation of skin protection. The workers had been exposed to many chemicals. Those working in the GRP industry had also been exposed to glass fibre and to dust produced by finishing work. 94% used protective gloves. 22 workers, all employed in the GRP industry, had contracted occupational skin disorders. 6 had allergic and 12 irritant contact dermatitis. 4 workers had an accidental injury caused by a peroxide catalyst, fire, hot air and constant mechanical friction. Allergic dermatoses were due to natural rubber (latex) (4 cases) in protective gloves, phenol-formaldehyde resin (1 case) and cobalt naphthenate (1 case). Irritant hand dermatoses (5 cases) were caused by the combined hazardous effect of unsaturated polyester or vinyl ester resins, organic solvents, glass fibre and dust from finishing work on the skin. Other cases of irritant dermatoses (7 cases) were due to the dust, promoted by mechanical friction of clothes. Skin disorders in the GRP industry were common (26%) but the symptoms were mild and only 3 patients had been on sick leave because of occupational skin disease.

AB Current-status data are often collected for use in survival analyses, because this type of data generally is considered to be more reliable than retrospective reports of when an event occurred. Although techniques for calculating mean survival time from current-status data are well known, their use in multiple regression models is somewhat troublesome. Using data on current breast-feeding behavior, this article considers a number of techniques that have been suggested in the literature, including parametric, nonparametric, and semiparametric models as well as the application of standard schedules. Models are tested in both proportional-odds and proportional-hazards frameworks. Although the choice of models does not strongly affect the conclusions that would be drawn, I recommend that a logistic regression in which the baseline log-odds of breast-feeding by child's age are represented by a natural cubic spline should be the preferred methodology. This methodology offers a reasonable compromise between the parsimony of parametric models and the flexibility and good fit of nonparametric models. The same methodology may be well suited to other applications in which there are no theoretical reasons to use a particular parametric form.

TI ORBITAL DEBRIS MINIMIZATION AND MITIGATION TECHNIQUES
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Man's activity in space has generated significant amounts of debris that remain in orbit long enough to become a hazard to future space activities. Upper stages and spacecraft that have ended their functional life are the largest objects. In the past, additional debris has been generated by inadvertent explosions of upper stages and spacecraft, by intentional explosions for military reasons, and possibly by a few breakups resulting from collisions. In the future, debris can be generated by collisions among spa as the number of orbital objects continues to grow at a rate greater than the rate at which natural forces remove them from orbit.
   Some design and operations practices can minimize the inadvertent generation of debris, and others can remove objects from space at the end of their useful service, so they are not a source for the generation of future debris. Those studies are the primary concern of this paper.
   The issues are different in the low Earth orbits and in the geosynchronous orbits. In low Earth orbit, the hazards generated by potential collisions among spacecraft are severe because the events take place at such high velocities. In geosynchronous orbit, the collision consequence is not so seven because the relative velocities are low-less than 1 km/s. But because of the value of the limited arc and the extremely long lifetime of the satellites, debris generated in the orbit must be removed to a different orbit at the end of life if it is not to be a hazard to future operational spacecraft.  The issue at present seems to be how high the reboost maneuver must be and what the system design and maneuver strategy should be to ensure effectiveness.
   The most economic removal of objects is achieved when those objects have the capability to execute the necessary maneuvers with their own systems and resources. The most costly option is to have some other system remove the object after it has become a derelict. Numerous options are being studied to develop systems and techniques that can remove objects from useful orbits at the end of their useful lift and do so for the least mass penalty and economic cost.

AB Objective: To evaluate the prognostic significance of cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin testing in persons infected with HIV.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: United States Air Force (USAF) Medical Center.
   Patients: Consecutive sample of 889 HIV-infected USAF personnel or dependents undergoing their first staging evaluation from 1985 through August 1990 in the USAF HIV Natural History Study.
   Measurements: All patients were evaluated with DTH skin testing including purified protein derivative and four control skin test antigens: mumps, candida, tetanus toxoid, and trichophyton. In addition, all patients underwent CD4+ T-cell surface marker determinations. The relation between DTH skin test response at first evaluation and progression to Walter Reed stage 6 (presence of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
   Results: Patients with more than 400 CD4+ T cells/mm3 are more likely than those having fewer than 400 CD4+ T cells per mm3 to respond to at least one (94% compared with 67%, P < 0.001) or at least two (86% compared with 45%, P < 0.001) DTH skin tests. Mean CD4 counts are lower for anergic compared with nonanergic patients and for patients responding to a single control skin test compared with those responding to two or more skin tests (P < 0.05). The DTH skin test response at first evaluation was also found to predict progression to AIDS; the relative risk at 5 years of follow-up was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2 to 5.2) for anergy compared with a single positive skin test and 3.0 (CI, 1.4 to 6.2) for a single compared with two or more skin test responses. The DTH skin test response at first evaluation was a predictor of progression (P < 0.001) when controlling for initial CD4 count and Walter Reed stage in a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.
   Conclusions: The DTH skin test response, a functional measure of cellular immunity, is an independent predictor of progression to AIDS in persons with HIV.

AB Organochlorine analysis was performed on adult and juvenile farm-raised mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) released and collected at three experimental sites in southern Ontario: Hamilton Harbour Confined Disposal Facility (CDF); Winona Sewage Lagoons (SL); and Big Creek Marsh, Canada. Collections were scheduled at 10, 30, and 70 days after release. Hamilton Harbour CDF and Winona SL are known to be contaminated whereas Big Creek Marsh is a relatively clean, natural site. All sites are important resting and feeding areas for migratory and resident waterfowl. Breast muscle concentrations of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in ducks collected 10 days after release (160.8 mug/kg, wet wt) at Hamilton Harbour CDF were more than 5300 times greater than day ''0'' birds (0.03 mug/kg). All ducks collected from Hamilton Harbour CDF had PCB concentrations exceeding Health and Welfare Canada and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for edible poultry. Concentrations of DDE (216.9 mug/kg), hexachlorobenzene (0.9 mug/kg), dieldrin (1.9 mug/kg), and 1,2,4,5,-tetrachlorobenzene (24.9 mug/kg) were significantly elevated in ducks utilizing Winona SL. Concentrations of 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, mirex, and photomirex were elevated at one or more of the sites. Ducks from Big Creek Marsh had lower contaminant concentrations than ducks from the other study sites. It is not clear whether bioaccumulation of organochlorines at these sites would pose a potential hazard to migratory and resident mallards; however, other duck species such as diving ducks that have more contact with sediments and sediment-derived foods would probably be at much higher fisk.

TI MORTALITY FROM ACCIDENTAL FALLS AMONG THE ELDERLY IN THE UNITED-STATES,

AB Falls in elderly persons primarily occur because of increasing intrinsic frailty rather than extrinsic environmental hazards. Thus declining mortality from accidental falls in the elderly predominantly reflects improved trauma management rather than injury prevention. Mortality attributed to accidental falls among individuals aged 60 to 85 years in the United States from 1962 through 1988 was analyzed using the Strehler-Mildvan modification of the Gompertz relationship of aging and mortality. This method of analysis can be used to define a disorder-specific age at which etiopathogenic influences are directly proportional to the mortality rate. From 1962 through 1988, the mortality rates (per 100,000) from accidental falls in the United States declined 63.5% (from 165.6 to 60.4) among men at age 83.4 years, and declined 76.3% (from 86.2 to 20.4) among women at age 77.5 years. This analysis suggests that trauma management, at the population level, was 2.74 times more effective in men and 4.22 times more effective in women at reducing mortality from accidental falls among the elderly in 1988 than in 1962.

TI FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TIME UNDER QUARANTINE FOR SWINE HERDS IN THE
   VOLUNTARY PHASE OF THE ILLINOIS PSEUDORABIES ERADICATION PROGRAM
SO PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID AUJESZKYS DISEASE VIRUS; ELIMINATION; INFECTION
AB The association of herd characteristics and intervention strategies with time under quarantine was evaluated for 163 farrow-to-finish swine herds enrolled in the voluntary phase (1986-1987) of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) eradication program in the state of Illinois (USA). Vaccination was the intervention strategy used most widely (69% of herds), particularly in larger herds. Depopulation was used primarily when PRV seroprevalence was high, and test-and-removal when seroprevalence was low. Approximately 50% of the herds were released from quarantine within 3 years of developing a herd clean-up plan.
   Multiple regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated the following. Vaccination had a strong association with a longer time until release from quarantine (P < 0.001). This is attributed to the lack of a vaccine differential test during this time, which made diagnosis of natural infection more difficult. Offspring segregation was associated with a longer time under quarantine (all herds: P = 0.05; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.004). Delay in implementation of a herd clean-up plan was also associated with longer time under quarantine (all herds: P = 0.012; non-vaccinated herds: P < 0.001 ). Herds with higher seroprevalence at the time of agreement to a herd plan required a longer time under quarantine (all herds: P < 0.001). This result was apparent for non-vaccinated herds (P = 0.001), and thus is not merely a consequence of vaccination. Herds in areas with a high geographic density of quarantined herds required a longer time before release from quarantine (all herds: P = 0.003), although this trend was not apparent for non-vaccinated herds (P = 0.39). After taking PRV seroprevalence into account, there was no apparent association of time under quarantine with sow herd size (all herds: P = 0.057; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.81) or confinement housing (all herds: P = 0.19; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.91).

TI DEMOGRAPHIC INFLUENCES ON RISK PERCEPTIONS

DE RISK; PERCEPTIONS; DEMOGRAPHICS; SURVEY
AB Over the past 15 years, psychologists have empirically investigated how people perceive technological, consumer, and natural hazards. The psychometric-attitudes to risk being summarized by three factors: ''dread,'' whether the risk is known, and personal exposure to the risk. The results have been used to suggest that certain types of hazards are viewed very differently from other hazards. The purpose of this paper is somewhat different, in that it investigates whether individual demographic characteristics influence psychometric perceptions of risk. This paper makes use of a large, professionally conducted, survey of a wide cross-section of the residents of metropolitan Chicago. One thousand adults were interviewed in a random-digit dial telephone survey, producing a useable dataset of about 800. Data on the three risk factors mentioned above were obtained on 7-point scales for four common hazards: aviation accidents, fires in the home, automobile accidents, and stomach cancer. The survey also collected demographic data on respondents' age, schooling, income, sex, and race. Regressions were then conducted to relate the demographic characteristics to risk perceptions. Some strong general conclusions can be drawn. The results suggest that women, people with lower levels of schooling and income, younger people, and blacks have more dread of hazards. The exception being age-related illnesses which, not unnaturally, are feared by older people. Unlike previous literature, we cannot substantiate the argument that these groups of people are less informed about hazards and thus less accepting of them. The most likely leading explanation of the relationship between demographic factors and dread of a hazard is the perceived personal exposure to the hazard. People with greater perceived exposure to a hazard are more fearful.

TI HAZARD AREA DISCLOSURE IN NEW-ZEALAND - THE IMPACTS ON RESIDENTIAL

DT Article
ID FLOODPLAIN
AB Disclosure of the hazardousness of locations through maps and land use policies has been recommended by researchers in New Zealand in order to increase awareness of the potential for a natural hazard in a community and to allow residents to make informed locational decisions. Opposition to this recommendation has come mostly from the business sector, which argues that such disclosure will have a negative effect on property values. However, this has not been proven, and research results elsewhere are contradictory. Despite opposition, some communities in New Zealand have implemented hazard area disclosure. Two of these communities serve as case studies for this research. Te Aroha's maps and policies result from action following a damaging debris flow in 1985. Thames, a coastal community with riverine flooding problems, uses flood zone maps for building and planning decisions. Evaluation of residential real estate sales before and after disclosure suggests that hazard designation and related policies have had no marked impact on property values. Even for houses with repeat sales, hazardousness was not a significant contributor to price differentials. Indeed, differences in values can be attributed to housing characteristics irrespective of the level of hazardousness associated with a location.

TI GAMMA ACTIVITY IN LAHORE - PAKISTANI BUILDING-MATERIALS
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural radioactivity due to K-30, Ra-226, and Th-232 has been measured, using a HPGe (high purity germanium) based gamma-ray spectrometer, in samples of unbaked clay bricks, sand, cement, aggregate or crush, marble chips, and glass used for the construction of dwellings in the city of Lahore (Pakistan). The radium equivalent activities and hazard indices have been determined for these materials. The maximum value of the radium equivalent activity is 319 +/- 10 Bq kg-1 in ceramics, which is less than the normally accepted limit of 370 Bq kg-1. The maximum values of hazard indices are also less than unity except for some ceramic samples. Therefore, the materials used for the construction of dwellings in Lahore do not pose a major gamma-ray hazard.
   The dose equivalent rate due to gamma-rays at the centre of a standard size room is theoretically determined. Our calculations show that the gamma-dose equivalent rate is smaller by a factor of 2.5 if the buildings are made from concrete rather than from clay bricks.

AB Background. Relatively limited epidemiological data are available regarding the prognosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) and temporal changes in survival after its onset in a population-based setting.
   Methods and Results. Proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effects of selected clinical variables on survival after the onset of CHF among 652 members of the Framingham Heart Study (51% men; mean age, 70.0+/-10.8 years) who developed CHF between 1948 and 1988. Subjects were older at the diagnosis of heart failure in the later decades of this study (mean age at heart failure diagnosis, 57.3+/-7.6 years in the 1950s, 65.9+/-7.9 years in the 1960s, 71.6+/-9.4 years in the 1970s, and 76.4+/-10.0 years in the 1980s; p <0.001). Median survival after the onset of heart failure was 1.7 years in men and 3.2 years in women. Overall, 1-year and 5-year survival rates were 57% and 25% in men and 64% and 38% in women, respectively. Survival was better in women than in men (age-adjusted hazards ratio for mortality, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.54-0.77). Mortality increased with advancing age in both sexes (hazards ratio for men, 1.27 per decade of age; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47; hazards ratio for women, 1.61 per decade of age; 95% CI, 1.37-1.90). Adjusting for age, there was no significant temporal change in the prognosis of CHF during the 40 years of observation (hazards ratio for men for mortality, 1.08 per calendar decade; 95% CI, 0.92-1.27; hazards ratio for women for mortality, 1.02 per calendar decade; 95% CI, 0.83-1.26).
   Conclusions. CHF remains highly lethal, with better prognosis in women and in younger individuals. Advances in the treatment of hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and valvular heart disease during the four decades of observation did not translate into appreciable improvements in overall survival after the onset of CHF in this large, unselected population.

AB Background. A variety of measures of heart rate variability have been devised to measure high-frequency (0.15-0.40 Hz), low-frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz), or ultralow-frequency (<0.0033 Hz) fluctuations in sinus cycle length. Although measures of low-frequency and ultralow-frequency heart rate variability have been shown to correlate with prognosis in several populations with ischemic heart disease, their relevance to patients with primary valvular heart disease remains to be determined.
   Methods and Results. Thirty-eight patients with nonischemic causes of chronic severe mitral regurgitation who were in sinus rhythm underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography as part of a prospective study of the natural history of regurgitant valvular heart disease. Patients were followed for as long as 9.2 years, and end points of mortality, progression to mitral valve surgery, and development of chronic atrial fibrillation were tabulated. Time- and frequency-domain measurements of high-frequency, low-frequency, and ultralow-frequency heart rate variability were computed and compared with resting ventricular function by radionuclide cineangiography and outcome. The standard deviation of the 5-minute mean RR intervals (SDANN), a measure of ultralow-frequency heart rate variability, was correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (r=0.49, p=0.002) and right ventricular ejection fraction (r=0.43, p=0.007), whereas low-frequency and high-frequency heart rate variabilities were not. Heart rate, ultralow-frequency heart rate variability, and, to a lesser extent, high-frequency heart rate variability exhibited significant diurnal variation, but low-frequency heart rate variability did not. Heart rate and ultralow-frequency, low-frequency, and combined low- and high-frequency heart rate variability predicted mortality and total events. The most powerful predictor of subsequent events was SDANN. Patients with reduced SDANN were significantly more likely to develop end-point events (p<0.001) with increased progression to mitral valve surgery (p<0.001) as well as increased early mortality (p=0.02). In a multivariate proportional hazards model, SDANN retained independent predictive power (p=0.001). Likewise, SDANN was the only variable that was significantly associated with the subsequent development of atrial fibrillation (relative risk, 3.1; p=0.03).
   Conclusions. Ultralow-frequency heart rate variability, as measured by SDANN, correlates with right and left ventricular performance and predicts development of atrial fibrillation, mortality, and progression to valve surgery in patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation.

ID ACCIDENTS
AB The task of diagnosis is a very important topic in many different contexts. In highly complex technical installations involving high hazards, such as process plants, diagnosis is a crucial part of disturbance control; in technical maintenance, diagnosis is necessary to locate the root cause of system failures; and in medicine, diagnosis is the basis for any patient treatment. The paper presents a discussion of the basic nature of causal reasoning as applied for diagnosis and the mental strategies applied when diagnosis is viewed as an integrated part of ''natural decision making'' for interaction with the environment. A typology is suggested to characterize diagnosis in different domains such as process control, maintenance and medicine. In addition, an attempt is made to distinguish between the features of diagnosis depending on the ultimate aim, whether it is explanation, compensation, repair, or punishment and the difference in the context of the task, ''the causal field,'' related to the mental model involved in the different cases is outlined.

AB Strain BST-1 is a derivative of Escherichia coli K-12 that carries a plasmid designated pURA-4 and is the expression system used by The Upjohn Company in the production of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbSt). This plasmid also encodes an ampicillin resistance gene. The plasmidless carrier strain, BST-1C, contains a gene for tetracycline resistance which is provided by the chromosomal insertion of the transposon Tn10. Therefore, BST-1 is resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, while BST-1C is resistant only to tetracycline. The Food and Drug Administration requested that we conduct an environmental assessment study to monitor the 'persistence of the recombinant live K-12 E. coli organism compared to the host E. coli organism'. In addition, we were requested to monitor 'the potential transfer of genetic material from (our) recombinant organism to the indigenous microflora' of the mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The differences in persistence were determined by monitoring shedding of BST-1 and BST-1C in the feces of conventionally reared, outbred mice inoculated with either of the two strains. Even with antibiotic selective pressure applied (tetracycline in the water), BST-1 did not persist as well as the non-plasmid carrying parental stain, BST-1C. In the gene transfer experiments, transfer of pURA-4 was monitored by the appearance of the ampicillin resistance marker and/or by hybridization assays for the rbSt gene in indigenous, mouse-colonizing E. coli strains which had been made streptomycin resistant. At the limit of detection, no transfer of pURA-4 was detected either in vitro or in vivo. These data support an interpretation that BST-1 does not present an environmental hazard as measured by colonization/persistence in the gut of convention ally reared mammals.

AB Safety or health hazards exist with some common types of vacuum gauging including mercury manometers, thermal conductivity gauges, and ionization gauges. Mercury filled manometers and McLeod gauges have been replaced by other gauging in most applications. The difficulty with thermal conductivity gauges arises because the calibration curves for various gases diverge widely at the upper end of the range, from 10 to 1000 Torr. When they are used to monitor backfilling to atmospheric pressure, dangerous over or under pressure situations may exist if the identity of the gas is not known. The greatest danger with hot cathode ionization gauge systems is electric shock from the high voltages supplied by the control unit. Especially with gauges using electron bombardment degas, proper use of grounds, cables, and connectors is necessary. A concern with many hot cathode ionization gauge sensors is the thorium oxide electron emitting coating on the cathode. Natural thorium is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 1.4 X 10(10) years. Yttrium oxide is a safe alternate coating material now available in ionization gauges.

AB A recent study of desertification in Crete and the south Aegean has found few signs of climatic change or accelerated soil erosion. Increasing reliance on ground water presents a risk for the future. The main changes in the landscape are a great extension of the area under olives, and an increase in natural trees and bushes. More pines present a fire hazard. Burning of maquis by shepherds requires further examination. Migration, urbanisation and technological developments in agriculture in the last few decades have had a profound effect on Mediterranean landscapes. Depopulation of mountainous inland areas and small offshore islands results in a diminution of the historical and scenic value of their landscapes. This research project aims to identify and characterise landscapes in western Crete which are of special value and which are threatened by current developments; it attempts to trace changes in the last few decades, and to propose means of maintaining them in the future.

TI ROLE OF NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS IN CANCER
SO NATURAL IMMUNITY

DT Article
DE NATURAL KILLER CELLS; LEUKEMIA; SOLID TUMORS; PROGNOSIS; INTERLEUKIN-2
AB This paper reviews recent publications and presents data dealing with natural killer (NK) cell activity in the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and peripheral blood (PBL) of patients with solid tumors and leukemia. Cells with NK markers or function are not a prominent feature of lymphoid infiltrates in solid tumors and, when present, do not appear to correlate with other prognostic variables. Nevertheless, NK cells, among IL-2-activated TIL mediate antitumor cytotoxicity. Many studies indicate that NK activity is reduced in patients with advanced cancer. In some of these studies, low NK activity has been shown to be an unfavorable prognostic variable. PBL, splenic and bone marrow NK activity in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is also decreased. However, adherent IL-2-activated lymphocytes composed primarily of NK cells were found to be cytotoxic against AML blasts and could be generated from patients in remission and relapse. The question of whether low NK activity in solid tumors and leukemia is the result of the disease state or contributes to it, remains unanswered. Data are also presented here showing that treated, apparently disease-free patients with high PBL NK activity have a significantly longer metastasis-free survival time than those with low NK activity (n = 91, p < 0.026, Cox proportional hazards test).

TI ECOLOGY OF TRANSGENIC OILSEED RAPE IN NATURAL HABITATS
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB CONCERNS about genetically engineered crop plants centre on three conjectural risks: that transgenic crop plants will become weeds of agriculture or invasive of natural habitats; that their engineered genes will be transferred by pollen to wild relatives whose hybrid offspring will then become more weedy or more invasive; or that the engineered plants will be a direct hazard to humans, domestic animals or beneficial wild organisms (toxic or allergenic, for example). Here we describe an experimental protocol for assessing the invasiveness of plants. The object is to determine whether genetic engineering for herbicide tolerance affects the likelihood of oilseed rape becoming invasive of natural habitats. By estimating the demographic parameters of transgenic and conventional oilseed rape growing in a variety of habitats and under a range of climatic conditions, we obtain a direct comparison of the ecological performance of three different genetic lines (control, kanamycin-tolerant transgenics and herbicide-tolerant transgenic lines). Despite substantial variation in seed survival, lines were less invasive and less persistent than their conventional counter arts.

AB Ninety-two patients with duodenal ulcer disease, who had received long-term continuous treatment with ranitidine for an average of 7.5 years, participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine whether stopping ranitidine resulted in ulcer recurrence. Patients were randomized to continue with ranitidine (n = 46) or to receive placebo (n = 46) and were followed up for six months. Treatment failure was defined as the first symptomatic recurrence of ulcer.
   The occurrence of epigastric pain during the follow-up period was significantly less frequent in the ranitidine group (13 %) than in the placebo group (43 %) (P = 0.00 1). At six months, 9 % of the ranitidine group had developed ulcer recurrence, compared with 48 % in the placebo group (P < 0.001, logrank test). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that younger age (P = 0.041) and a long history of ulcer disease (P = 0.02 5) were risk factors for ulcer recurrence but gender, smoking and duration or dose of previous ranitidine treatment were not predictive of relapse during treatment with placebo. In conclusion, withdrawal of ranitidine after more than five years of continuous treatment results in almost half of the patients developing symptomatic ulcer recurrence within six months. Thus, long-term continuous therapy does not alter the natural history of duodenal ulcer disease. Younger patients and those with a long history of ulcer disease appear to be at increased risk of developing ulcer recurrence if long-term treatment is withdrawn.

AB Hampel's influence function and its finite-sample counterparts are the basis for a number of diagnostic statistics. These diagnostics can be expensive to compute in the natural way when the estimation calculations are iterative, as they frequently are when maximum likelihood or robust methods are used. We show how the influence function can be calculated in these situations by implicit differentiation of the fixed-point equation satisfied by the limit of the iterative process. We consider in particular the cases of Newton's method and iteratively reweighted least squares where interesting analytic results are available. As an application we consider the generalization of Pregibon's (1981) logistic regression diagnostics to cover generalized linear models with non-canonical link functions such as probit regression.

TI GLOBAL WARMING AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the last few decades, the international insurance industry has been confronted with a drastic increase in the scope and frequency of great natural disasters. The trend is primarily attributable to the continuing steady growth of the world population and the increasing concentration of people and economic values in urban areas. An additional factor is the global migration of populations and industries into areas such as coastal regions, which are particularly exposed to natural hazards. The natural hazards themselves, on the other hand, have not yet shown any significant increase. In addition to the problems the insurance industry has with regard to pricing, capacity and loss reserves, the assessment of insured liabilities, preventive planning and the proper adjustment of catastrophe losses are gaining importance. The present problems will be dramatically aggravated if the greenhouse predictions come true. The increased intensity of all convective processes in the atmosphere will force up the frequency and severity of tropical cyclones, tornados, hailstorms, floods and storm surges in many parts of the world with serious consequences for all types of property insurance. Rates will have to be raised and in certain coastal areas insurance cover will only be available after considerable restrictions have been imposed, as for example significant deductibles and low liability or loss limits. In areas of high insurance density the loss potential of individual catastrophes can reach a level at which the national and international insurance industries will run into serious capacity problems. Recent disasters showed the disproportionately high participation of reinsurers in extreme disaster losses and the need for more risk transparency if the insurance industry is to fulfil its obligations in an increasingly hostile environment.

TI HOLONOMIC ELASTOPLASTIC RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS OF TRUSS SYSTEMS .1. THEORY
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE

ID STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Because elastoplastic behavior is a very real possibility under the hazard of random actions during the lifetime of a structural system, it is natural that methods of reliability theory have to be used for the assessment of this type of behavior. The present paper is the first part of an investigation on holonomic elastoplastic reliability analysis of truss systems under random loads. The formulation of a method that accounts for the nonlinear behavior of truss systems by using holonomic elastoplastic analysis is outlined. Following a brief description of the deterministic direct holonomic elastoplastic analysis formulation, a modified formulation is proposed for the purpose of reliability analysis. The derived formulation is used in conjunction with both the elastoplastic mode generation method and the mathematical programming method to solve the reliability analysis problem of holonomic elastoplastic truss systems under random loads. In this problem, both excessive elastoplastic displacements and plastic collapse are considered as system limit states.

AB A large, detailed data set is used to examine the effect of the Loma Prieta (World Series) earthquake on housing prices in the San Francisco Bay area. This relationship is examined while controlling for potential confounding variables, such as location-specific risk and the timing of the earthquake. The results indicate that the Loma Prieta earthquake caused an area wide reduction in property values. In addition, it seems that individuals considered other measures of earthquake risk in their housing purchases, yielding a measurable price gradient. These results are relatively robust, remaining stable across estimated-functional forms and independent variable sets.

TI TERRESTRIAL PROCESS RESEARCH USING A MULTISCALE GEOGRAPHIC APPROACH
SO PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Earth systems are interrelated in complex ways which are inadequately understood. An improved understanding of these systems is necessary to develop effective policies for the stewardship and management of our planet. The natural and human systems must be studied together to understand the processes that cause changes on global and regional scales. The understanding gathered must be communicated in a meaningful way to managers and decision makers.
   The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has developed a priority framework for global change research that is designed to meet the above concerns. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is one of the agencies conducting research into global change with an emphasis on the terrestrial environment. The USGS addresses critical Earth processes using a multiscale geographic approach. This approach has been successful in making significant scientific findings of use not only for modeling of global change but also to support decision making about hazards, resource use, and other environmental issues. It has also supported a strong effort in data management to ensure the diffusion of data and information throughout the scientific and management communities.

   CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; INFARCTION; SILENT
AB Objective.-To determine the clinical significance of silent and symptomatic myocardial ischemia detected by noninvasive testing in stable postcoronary patients.
   Design.-Cohort study with a mean 23-month follow-up.
   Setting.-Ambulatory outpatients after recent hospitalization for an acute coronary event.
   Patients.-Nine hundred thirty-six patients (76% male; mean age, 58 years) who were clinically stable 1 to 6 months after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
   Interventions.-Noninvasive testing involved rest, ambulatory, and exercise electrocardiograms and stress thallium-201 scintigraphy.
   Main Outcome Measures.-Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk (hazard ratio) of first recurrent primary events (cardiac death, nonfatal infarction, or unstable angina) or restricted events (cardiac death or nonfatal infarction) associated with ischemic noninvasive test results.
   Results.-ST segment depression on the rest electrocardiogram was the only noninvasive test variable that identified a significantly increased risk (P=.05) for first recurrent primary events (hazard ratio; 95% confidence limits): rest electrocardiogram ST depression (1.5; 1.00, 2.25); ambulatory electrocardiogram ST depression (0.86; 0.49, 1.51); exercise electrocardiogram ST depression (1.13; 0.82, 1.56); and stress thallium-201 reversible defects (1.3; 0.96, 1.74). Test results were similar for first recurrent restricted events, and in patients with and without angina. Significantly increased risk (P<.05) was noted when exercise-induced ST depression occurred in patients who also had reduced exercise duration (hazard ratio, 3.4) or when reversible thallium-201 defects occurred in patients who also had increased lung uptake (hazard ratio, 2.8). Each high-risk subset made up less than 3% of the population and contained less than 6% of patients with first primary events.
   Conclusion.-Detection of silent or symptomatic myocardial ischemia by noninvasive testing in stable patients 1 to 6 months after an acute coronary event is not useful in identifying patients at increased risk for subsequent coronary events.

AB Objective: To investigate the relation between detection of syncytium-inducing (SI), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants, rate of CD4+ cell decline, and clinical progression.
   Design: Prospective study during a 2.5-year follow-up period; cohort study with pairwise matched controls.
   Setting: The Amsterdam cohort study on the course of HIV-1 infection in homosexual men.
   Participants: Asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men (n = 225) were tested for the presence of SI variants and were studied prospectively for CD4+ cell decline and clinical progression. In addition, 45 men with a defined moment of appearance of SI variants and 45 matched controls without SI variants were compared for CD4+ cell decline.
   Measurements: Syncytium-inducing variants were detected by cocultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the MT-2 T-cell line.
   Results: During a 30-month period, 70.8% of the men with SI variants progressed to AIDS, compared with 15.8% of men without SI variants at entry (P <0.0001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, controlling for CD4+ cell count and HIV-p24 antigenemia, showed a relative hazard for SI variants of 6.7 (95% Cl, 3.5 to 12.7). In the matched control study, before the appearance of SI variants, CD4+ cell counts of 45 men with SI variants and their controls were compared. Syncytium-inducing variants emerged at a mean CD4+ cell count of 0.48 x 10(9)/L (Cl, 0.42 to 0.54), coinciding with the onset of a threefold increased rate of CD4+ cell decline. Men developing AIDS with SI variants had decreased CD4+ cell counts (0.08 x 10(9)/L; 95% Cl, 0.05 to 0.12) at the time of diagnosis compared with persons progressing to AIDS without SI variants (0.25 x 10(9)/L; 95% Cl, 0.15 to 0.41) (P = 0.0035).
   Conclusions: The HIV-1 biological phenotype is a practical, binary marker for progression to AIDS, which is independent of decreased CD4+ cell counts and antigenemia. Appearance of SI variants, occurring 2 years before progression to AIDS on the average, is predictive for a significantly increased rate of CD4+ cell decline.

   REFUSAL
AB The value of cancer treatment was assessed using a 'natural experiment' where patients who refused treatment served as no-treatment controls in a situation where withholding treatment to form a control group is unethical. Each cancer patient who refused treatment in Alberta, Canada between 1975 and 1988 was compared with five subjects who accepted treatment, matched on cancer site, age, number of cancers, and time period. Variables associated with treatment-refusal were included in Cox's proportional hazards model of survival, with death from cancer as the endpoint and deaths from other causes as censored observations. Treatment was refused at a rate of 7.5 per 1,000. One-third of patients who refused treatment had lung cancer and most had unstaged disease. Treatment refusal was associated with a difference in median survival of approximately nine months. Site-specific analyses showed a range of effects. Case fatality among the treated patients fell by approximately 10 percent during the 14-year study period. Even in advanced disease, treatment can result in improved survival. However, the results of this study must be interpreted with caution and cannot be generalized to all cancer patients.

TI ISSUES IN FISHERY PRODUCTS SAFETY IN THE UNITED-STATES

LA English
DT Article
AB Most seafoods available to the U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to cause illness in the consumer. Nevertheless, there are areas of risk. The major risk of acute disease is associated with the consumption of raw shellfish, particularly bivalve molluscs. For persons living in tropical areas, there is a risk of ciguatera; other natural toxins (paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, etc.) have been associated with shellfish from endemic areas. Finally, there are less well-defined risks of acute and chronic disease related to environmental contamination of aquatic food animals. Dealing with such risks on a short-term basis requires improvements in the present system of regulatory control. In the long term, amelioration and eventual elimination of some hazards require strengthening and more effective application of control measures to prevent the disposal of human and industrial waste into offshore marine and fresh waters.

AB This paper discusses the multicriteria capacity-mix problem of electric utilities. Traditional least-cost generation-expansion planning has become inadequate due to the prevailing multiple, conflicting objectives such as cost, environmental degradation, and nuclear hazards. This particularly true with emerging concerns over carbon dioxide emissions that are believed to contribute to global warming. In this paper we present the preference-order dynamic programming approach, so that this new logic can be implemented with the already available dynamic-programming-based capacity-expansion planning tool, called Wien Automatic System Planning Package (WASP). Through our case study, we note the importance of considering global warming as well as nuclear hazards. We also note that substituting plants that use cleaner fuels such as natural gas for those that use carbon-intensive fuels such as coal is more effective in controlling carbon dioxide emissions. This substitution method is also more effective than replacing these plants with carbon dioxide-free nuclear units.

AB Background. Whether the plasma triglyceride level is a risk factor for coronary heart disease has been controversial, and evaluation of the triglyceride level as a risk factor is fraught with methodologic difficulties.
   Methods. We studied the association between plasma triglyceride levels and the 12-year incidence of death from coronary heart disease in 10 North American populations participating in the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study, while adjusting for the potential confounding effects of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. All analyses were sex-specific, and separate analyses were performed in high and low strata of HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and age.
   Results. The rates of coronary death in both men and women increased with the triglyceride level. In Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age, in which the natural log of the triglyceride levels was used to give a normal distribution, the relative risk per natural-log unit of triglyceride (e.g., a triglyceride level of 150 mg per deciliter vs. a level of 55 mg per deciliter) was 1.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 1.98; P<0.001) in men and 1.88 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 2.98; P = 0.007) in women. After an adjustment for potential covariates, however, these relative risks were not statistically significant. Analyses based on lipoprotein cholesterol levels revealed a positive association between the triglyceride level and coronary mortality in the lower stratum of both HDL and LDL cholesterol, but not in the higher stratum. Conversely, the HDL cholesterol level was unrelated to coronary mortality in the lower stratum of LDL cholesterol, but was strongly inversely associated with coronary death in the higher stratum of LDL cholesterol. The relative risk of coronary death associated with triglyceride level was higher at younger ages. The associations between the triglyceride level and coronary mortality in the lower HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and age strata were small and were further reduced by an adjustment for the fasting plasma glucose level.
   Conclusions. Overall, the plasma triglyceride level showed no independent association with coronary mortality. However, in subgroups of subjects with lower HDL and LDL cholesterol levels and in younger subjects, defined a priori, an association between the triglyceride level and coronary mortality was observed, although this association was small and was not statistically significant after an adjustment for the plasma glucose level.

AB Whether or not young age at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor in breast cancer has long been controversial, in part because much previous work has not taken due account of menopausal status and confounding factors. We have analysed the influence of age on prognosis in a consecutive series of 1703 patients with stage I-III breast cancer. All were premenopausal and all were treated in one centre (Institut Curie, Paris) between 1981 and 1985. Mean age was 44 years (range 23-55) and median follow-up was 82 months.
   Younger patients had significantly lower survival rates and higher local and distant relapse rates than older patients. The hazard rate of relapse decreased over time in the youngest age group (less-than-or-equal-to 33) to reach that of older patients after 5 years. The relation between the hazard of recurrence and age was a continuous one, best fitted by a log-linear function and indicating a 4% decrease in recurrence for every year of age. Multivariate analysis of both survival and disease-free interval demonstrated that the worse prognosis of young age was independent of other factors such as clinical tumour size, clinical node status, histological grade, hormone receptor status, locoregional treatment procedure, and adjuvant systemic therapy.
   This difference in outlook has yet to be explained biologically but it does suggest the need for a closer look at the natural history of breast cancer in young women.

AB Backcalculation has been used to estimate the rate of past HIV infection and to predict future AIDS incidence. In this study we examine another use: estimating the probability of progression from HIV infection to AIDS as a function of time from infection. Given observed AIDS incidence data, the technique of backcalculation estimates the most likely number of persons infected with HIV in the past. Assumptions about probability of progression from HIV infection to AIDS are necessary. By varying these assumptions and examining the resulting goodness of fit to the AIDS incidence data, we can theoretically estimate parameters of progression. We report on implementation of this method and examine its practical utility in deciding among four competing progression models specified on a priori grounds. The four specific models comprise three Weibull distributions with medians of 8, 10, and 12 years, respectively, and one model that begins as a Weibull with 8 year median but where the hazard is level after 3.5 years. To employ asymptotic maximum likelihood methods, we define a two parameter family of progression models that includes all four a priori models. One parameter sets the scale for an initial Weibull progression (the shape parameter being fixed for all models), and the other specifies a levelling point after which the hazard remains constant.
   AIDS incidence data from Canada's national surveillance system provided the empiric data for this evaluation. First we corrected these data for reporting delay by Poisson modelling of the delay distribution. We used three parametric families of infection curves: step-function, log-logistic, and logistic.
   The results support the hypothesis of an early levelling of the hazard function. When we fixed the scale parameter to that of the Weibull curve with 8 year median, the maximum likelihood estimate of the levelling point was 2.7 years, and a clearly superior fit was produced compared to a pure Weibull progression with the same scale parameter (likelihood ratio chi-square of 10.6 on 1 degree of freedom, p = 0.001). The maximum was indistinguishable in fit from the levelling point of 3.5 years hypothesized in advance (chi-square = 0.30, d.f. = 1, p = 0.58). Backcalculation, however, could not determine the Weibull scale parameter itself because the likelihood was quite flat as a function of this parameter. We conclude that one must determine the parameters governing the initial shape of the hazard function from other kinds of data.
   We interpret the model with levelling of the hazard as an empirical description of progression in a real population rather than as natural history in a homogeneous population. We make comparisons with other recently proposed models of progression.

ID LONG PIPELINES
AB The flow in a long, high pressure, natural gas pipeline following sudden rupture was modelled as unsteady one-dimensional isothermal flow. The set of hyperbolic partial differential equations were solved with a numerical method of characteristics. The accuracy of the numerical scheme when using linear characteristics with quadratic interpolation was found to be adequate. It was also found that the effect of the curvature of characteristics in isothermal flow was not as pronounced as it was reported in adiabatic flow by Flatt. To assess the hazard of a natural gas pipeline rupture, it is necessary to know the rate of outflow of the gas at the breakpoint as a function of time. The predicted mass flow rate of gas out of the broken end was 18% lower than that predicted using adiabatic flow theory, whereas, there was good agreement with the result, of earlier workers who also used isothermal flow theory whose computation method was based on weighted residuals.

AB The paper reviews various options adopted in the UK for engineered protection measures aimed at preventing pollution to the environs of landfill sites. The advantages and limitations of both natural and synthetic lining materials are discussed, recognizing the constraints posed by the geometry and geology of prospective landfill sites. Particular attention is given to the Environmental Safety Centre experience with techniques designed to minimize both leachate and gaseous emissions, and hence prevent pollution of ground and surface waters, and reduce hazards to nearby property. Options for operational practices and restoration procedures are discussed in relation to the control of degradation processes and polluting potential. Included in these options are design and operation of leachate and gas collection/treatment systems, phasing of landfilling operations, and progressive restoration of sites. Monitoring requirements are emphasized as a vital measure of the success or failure of site designs and operational practices in ensuring that appropriate environmental protection is achieved and maintained.

TI CLASSIFICATION OF PERMAFROST ACTIVE LAYER DEPTH FROM REMOTELY SENSED AND
   TOPOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The remote detection of permafrost (perennially frozen ground) has important implications to environmental resource development, engineering studies, natural hazard prediction, and climate change research. In this study, we present results from two experiments into the classification of permafrost active layer depth within the zone of discontinuous permafrost in northern Canada. A new software system (MERCURY+) based on evidential reasoning was implemented to permit the integrated classification of multisource data consisting of landcover, terrain aspect, and equivalent latitude (potential insolation), each of which possessed different formats, data types, or statistical properties that could not be handled by conventional classification algorithms available to this study. In the first experiment, four active layer depth classes were classified using ground based measurements of the three variables with an accuracy of 83% compared to in situ soil probe determination Of permafrost active layer depth at over 500 field sites. This confirmed the environmental significance of the variables selected, and provided a baseline result to which a remote sensing classification could be compared. In the second experiment, evidence for each input variable was obtained from image processing of digital SPOT imagery and a photogrammetric digital elevation model, and used to classify active layer depth with an accuracy of 79%. These results suggest the classification of evidence from remotely sensed measures of spectral response and topography may provide suitable indicators of permafrost active layer depth.

AB Chemical contaminants present in food may result from their natural occurrence in soil or water, from their production by microorganisms in food or in the food chain, from agricultural practices and from food processing and packaging.  However, perhaps of most concern from a public health standpoint are heavy metals and organic substances which predominantly arise from industrial and other human activities which pollute the environment.  Many of these contaminants may enter the food supply in sufficient amounts as to present a potential hazard for human health.
   Data for lead, cadmium, mercury and PCBs collected by GEMS/Food and from other sources have been presented.  Assessment of the dietary intakes of these contaminants indicates that the large majority of the population in reporting countries are not exposed to levels above the provisional tolerable levels recommended by JECFA and national authorities.  However, for may local areas and for certain groups of consumers with high consumption levels, dietary intakes may approach, and in certain instances, exceed tolerable levels.

TI DEATHS IN NATURAL HAZARDS IN THE SOLOMON-ISLANDS
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Archival and library search techniques have been used to establish extensive databases on deaths and damage resulting from natural hazards in the Solomon Islands. Although the records of fatalities are certainly incomplete, volcanic eruptions, tropical cyclones, landslides, tsunami and earthquakes appear to have been the most important. Only 22 per cent of the recorded deaths have resulted from meteorological hazards but a single event could change this proportion significantly. Five events in the fatality database account for 88 per cent of the recorded deaths. Future death tolls are also likely to be dominated by a small number of events. While the expected number of deaths in a given period is dependent upon the length of record considered, it is clear that a disaster which kills one hundred or more people in the Solomons can be expected more frequently than once in a hundred years.

TI ECONOMIC-EFFECTS OF RIVERBANK EROSION - SOME EVIDENCE FROM BANGLADESH
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID RESETTLEMENT; HAZARD
AB In this paper I investigate some of the economic effects of riverbank erosion in Bangladesh. The study was conducted in one village over the period 1979-89. Between these dates the village lost almost 20 per cent of its farmland to riverbank erosion. This resulted in a loss of more than 50 per cent of crop income (at 1989 prices). About 45 per cent of households were affected during the period. It appears, however, that there is little understanding among the relevant government agencies and non-governmental organisations of the severity of riverbank erosion in Bangladesh. This article aims to provide, therefore, some basic information on the various economic effects of this natural hazard.

SO ERDOL & KOHLE ERDGAS PETROCHEMIE
LA English
DT Article
AB Computer-based simulation models are of increasing importance for technical risk assessment and consequence evaluation. Thus empirical and fundamental fire and consequence models are discussed that are qualified for fire hazard calculations. The empirical relations include open pool fires, enclosed pool fires, compartment fires, jet fires, diffusive flare fires, fires at sea and fireballs. A set of models rated to be reliable and of predictive power are integrated in the computer program FIREX, which is briefly described.
   The three-dimensional field model KOBRA-3D is presented as an example of combined empirical and fundamental fire modelling. This model describes the buyoant convective flow in a forced or natural ventilated compartment, caused by a fire or heat source. The heat release can either be specified as external input data or can be calculated using an empirical relation for the dynamical burning rate of hydrocarbon pool fires. The efficiency of this complex simulation model, designed for personal computer applications, is demonstrated by comparing the numerical results with empirical data derived from fire experiments performed at the SINTEF Norwegian Fire Research Laboratory in Trondheim.

AB The British Gas coal gasification programme was concluded at the end of 1991, having achieved the objectives of demonstrating at a commercial scale the gasification of power station coals with the British Gas-Lurgi (BGL) gasifier to make a clean fuel gas for combined-cycle power generation and for making substitute natural gas (SNG). Three key elements of the programme were the purification of the crude gas from the gasifier, treatment of the water to an environmentally acceptable standard, and characterization of the leaching properties of the slag. Pilot plant work at the Westfield Development Centre demonstrated that the sulphur of the fuel gas could readily be reduced by >99% for combined-cycle applications and by the 99.95% required to avoid poisoning of the methanation catalyst for upgrading to SNG. Processes studied for water purification included incineration, catalytic wet air oxidation, and the biological route with reverse osmosis. There is a range of viable alternative process routes for water treatment enabling the water to be reused within the gasification complex or safely discharged into the environment. The slag is a highly inert material presenting no hazard to the environment.

TI EFFECTS OF LABETALOL ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT ON UTEROPLACENTAL AND

DE HYPERTENSION; PREECLAMPSIA; ANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT; PREGNANCY;
   LABETALOL
AB Objective: Although the benefits of labetalol for antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy have been questioned and concerns expressed regarding potential hazard to the fetus, especially when growth retarded, the possible adverse effects of oral labetalol have not previously been thoroughly investigated. The present study was designed to ascertain whether oral labetalol has adverse effects on uteroplacental and fetal aortic blood flow.
   Methods: Eighteen pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) (n = 8) or preeclampsia (n = 10) in the third trimester were given labetalol (200-600 mg daily). No cases of suspected intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) were included in the study. Pulsed Doppler blood flow measurements were performed in the fetal aorta, umbilical vessels, and maternal uterine artery immediately before the start of treatment and after one week's treatment. Maternal blood pressure, heat rate, proteinuria, and serum concentrations of creatinine, urate, and transaminases were also monitored. The blood flow results were withheld from the attending physician.
   Results: Neither maternal blood pressure nor maternal heart rate changed significantly during treatment, but the serum concentrations of creatinine, urate, and alanine-aminotransferase, as well as the degree of protein-uria, increased significantly. No correlations were found between maternal or fetal blood flow changes and the dose of labetalol. Neither pulsatility index (PI) in the maternal uterine artery or in the umbilical artery, nor umbilical venous mean velocity or volume flow, changed significantly during treatment, but fetal aortic mean velocity decreased significantly and fetal aortic PI increased significantly. During the study period, 7 fetuses manifested poor growth and three neonates were small for gestational age (SGA). Maternal uterine PI was significantly higher in the IUGR group than in the non-IUGR group, both before and during treatment. Twelve of the 14 blood flow variables changed during treatment from a normal to an abnormal value, and 1 of 7 changed from an abnormal to a normal value in the IUGR/SGA group (n = 8).
   Conclusions: Oral labetalol treatment had no adverse effects upon uteroplacental or umbilical blood flow. However, fetal aortic mean velocity decreased and fetal aortic PI increased significantly during treatment, irrespective of whether fetal growth was normal or poor. Owing to the study design, it was not possible to show whether the abnormal flow values obtained during treatment in the IUGR/SGA group were predominantly due to labetalol or were a natural consequence of the fetal growth retardation. However, the adverse effect on fetal aortic flow in fetuses with normal growth suggests that labetalol exerts direct alpha and beta blocking effects on the fetus. In our opinion, measurements of uteroplacental and umbilical blood flow alone are insufficient to exclude the possibility of adverse effects of antihypertensive drugs on the fetus.

AB Manufacturers of consumer products, such as automobiles, usually offer warranties guaranteeing the product or its parts, for example, for five years or 50,000 miles, whichever comes first. There are at least two issues of interest to applied mathematicians and statisticians that arise from warranty considerations. The first is the specification of an optimum price-warranty combination, and the second is the forecast of a reserve fund to meet warranty claims against the product. The former involves a consideration of the item's reliability, its rate of usage, the consumer's attitude toward a specific warranty, and the competitor's actions, all of which lead towards a game theoretic formulation of the problem. The latter involves the analysis of a special kind of time series in two-dimensions, for which the use of dynamic linear models appears to be natural. This is an expository paper. Due to the timeliness of the topic, the focus here is on problem definition, its scope, and its formulation in a manner that facilitates analysis. Imbedded in the discussion are strategies for addressing some of the ensuing issues. The overall goal is to enlighten the reader about an area of research in the mathematical sciences that has an impact on industrial competitiveness and the manufacturing sciences.

AB Effective fecundability declines with age and parity. Furthermore, women differ in their effective fecundability: some women have persistently low or high monthly chances of live-birth conception. Estimates are presented concerning the magnitude of these effects in a natural-fertility population: 406 Hutterite women in North America who had 3,206 births, largely in the 1940s and 1950s. The estimates are based on models that incorporate the effects of persistent heterogeneity and that use the full information provided by multiple-spell duration data. In addition, hazards rather than probabilities are modeled, piecewise linear hazard functions are used, and age and parity effects are decomposed systematically.  These methods permit the development of more elaborate models of changing fecundability and of heterogeneity in postpartum amenorrhea.

TI RISK ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS GOODS BY ROAD AND RAIL
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
LA English
DT Article
AB In any debate about the transport of dangerous goods where the effectiveness of existing legislative controls is challenged, it is very important that there is a full understanding of the magnitude of the risks involved and the causes and major contributors so that properly informed decisions can be made. This paper gives details of the methodology developed for the analysis of the risks arising from the carriage, in bulk, of toxic and flammable substances by road and rail as part of a major study into the risks faced by the British population from the transport of dangerous substances. This paper concentrates on the novel aspects of the study and in particular consequence and human impact modelling. Models are given for the interaction of passenger and dangerous goods trains taking into account the ability of signals and other systems to detect and stop approaching trains. In the case of road transport, the models allow for the characteristics of different road types and the behaviour of motorists to be simulated. The relative risks of transporting hazardous materials by road or rail are explored and it is shown that the inclusion of motorist and rail passenger populations significantly affects the calculated risk levels. It is concluded that the safe routing of materials with large hazard ranges may be more easily achieved by road. While, the natural separation afforded by the rail system may make this mode more suitable for lower hazard materials. However, it is concluded that in Britain, there appears to be no evidence to support, on safety grounds, a general transfer of hazardous goods from road to rail or the reverse.

AB Objective-To determine the incidence and prognosis of congenital aortic valve stenosis in the five Health Districts of Liverpool that make up the Merseyside area.
   Design-The records of the Liverpool Congenital Malformations Registry and the Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital identified 239 patients (155 male, 84 female) born with aortic valve stenosis between 1960 and 1990. Patients were traced to assess the severity of stenosis at follow up. Information on the severity at presentation and all subsequent events was obtained.
   Results-Congenital aortic valve stenosis occurred in 5.7% of patients with congenital heart disease born in the Merseyside area. The median age at presentation was 16 months (range 0-20 years). Stenosis was mild at presentation in 145 patients, moderate in 33, severe in one and critical in 21 and 39 had a bicuspid valve without stenosis. Additional cardiac lesions were significantly more common in children presenting under one year of age and in those with critical stenosis. The median duration of follow up was 9.2 years (range 1-28 years) and seven patients were lost to follow up. 81 operations were performed in 60 patients. The reoperation rate was 28.3% after a median duration of 8.7 years (range 2.5-18 years). 15% of patients who presented with mild stenosis subsequently required operation compared with 67% of those with moderate stenosis. There were no sudden unexpected deaths and no deaths after aortic valvotomy, except in those presenting with critical stenosis. Mortality was 16.7% but patients presenting with critical aortic stenosis had a much worse prognosis. Actuarial and hazard analysis showed that the survival and absence of serious events (aortic valve surgery or balloon dilatation, endocarditis, or death) were significantly better in patients who presented with mild aortic stenosis than in those who presented with moderate aortic stenosis. 75% of patients presenting with mild stenosis had not progressed to moderate stenosis after 10 years of follow up.
   Conclusions-Congenital aortic valve stenosis may be progressive even when it is mild at presentation. Patients presenting with mild stenosis, however, have a significantly better prognosis than those presenting with moderate stenosis. An accurate clinical and echocardiographic assessment of the severity of aortic valve stenosis at presentation provides a good guide to prognosis into early adult life.

AB The current views on lentil domestication are based on biological attributes of the wild progenitor Lens culinaris ssp. orientalis and on assumptions which have never been tested. Seed dormancy, a major factor in the adaptation of ssp. orientalis to its natural habitat, makes it inappropriate for cultivation, because poor germination causes seed yield following cultivation to be equal to the amount of sown seeds. Higher yield, resulting from the evolution of a non-dormant type can be obtained only after five or six cycles of unprofitable cultivation. It is doubtful that incipient farmers would have undertaken such an endeavor without preexisting knowledge that non-dormant types could eventually be obtained. Experiments involving the sowing of wild lentil would have been much more successful if the non-dormant types were present in appreciable quantities in the seed stock Establishment of that type in the natural population would have required a period of seven to eight years with favorable growing conditions allowing the non-dormant type to become widespread in the population, followed by massive predation by man reducing the hazard of a population explosion. The close similarity between isozyme profiles of the cultivated lentil and its wild progenitor indicates that lentil cultivation was attempted with seeds derived from different populations and in different areas.

AB The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development alerted the world to the hazards presumptive if the planet's natural resources of land, water, air, energy and biological organisms are not protected and utilised more conservatively. UNCED declared two urgent research priorities: global climate change and genetic diversity. Excessive use of fossil fuels and a resultant atmospheric pollution forebodes higher temperatures at the earth's surface. The consequences for agriculture are unpredictable. Alternative sources of energy are described: electric motors with high-capacity batteries and high energy fly-wheels; solar-thermal and photovoltaic systems of power generation. Global population will rise to at least 8 billion (1 billion = 10(9)) by 2025, a rate of growth demanding an annual increase of 3% in agricultural production. The principles of sustainable production in relation to land and water management, genetic diversity among crop species, and food science and technology are discussed. Among the many thousand crop genotypes in the international germ plasm banks, more is known about agronomic characters than about functional properties relevant to food processing. Transgenic modifications broaden the spectrum of pest resistance in crops, but too little is known of the nutritional implications. Biotechnological advances, demands for non-polluting waste disposal, consumer concerns for food safety, the need to provide food security for a global population changing in age and income distribution, offer exciting challenges to all food scientists and technologists.

TI HURRICANE HAZARD IN WESTERN-SAMOA
SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Vulnerability of agricultural societies to natural hazards sometimes increases as those groups are incorporated into the global economy. Data and observations taken after a 1990 hurricane suggest that market participation did not increase vulnerability of two rural communities in Western Samoa. Although a weakening of the moral economy probably accentuated the vulnerability of poor households, the relationship between market participation and a breakdown in precapitalist social relationships was not simple. Positive self-help response of villages to the hurricane can be attributed to strength of their social institutions.

TI GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSE RAIN AND FLOODING IN NATAL
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB The combination of rugged topography and climate predisposes the province of Natal to severe floods. Information available since 1856 shows that bridge and slope failures have been recorded in twenty out of twenty-five flood episodes. Bridge failures are caused mostly by geological factors. The mechanism of failure can be classified broadly into foundation failures and changes of river course. Scour and debris build-up have led to failures of foundations located in rock and alluvial sediments. In repairing and replacing bridges the aims have been to increase the area of waterway, increase foundation depths to reach more competent strata and lay protection along banks and abutments to counteract scour. Historically, slope failures have not been well documented but following the 1987/88 storms 223 slope failures were recorded. The classification of the failures allowed the mechanisms of failure to be ascertained, and general design considerations to be reviewed. In areas adjacent to the Drakensberg Mountains slope failures are part of a natural erosion cycle which may be accelerated in periods of heavy rain. Throughout Natal, hummocky ground adjacent to dolerite intrusions reveals the on-going history of failure caused by water ingress and the generation of high pore water pressures on the slip planes. Classic flows occurred throughout the Greater Durban area where residual sandy soils of the Natal Group sandstone became supersaturated. Slumping was common on steep terrain underlain by granite-gneiss in the Kwa-Zulu area. Shales of the Pietermaritzburg Formation are notoriously unstable, yet few failures occurred during the summer storms of 1987/88. Inadequate drainage was responsible for many failures, this was particularly so along the railways.

TI RISK REDUCTION THROUGH REGULATORY CONTROL OF WASTE-DISPOSAL FACILITY
   SITING
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Structural failure of hazardous waste management facilities and consequent undesirable environmental and human health effects can result from natural and human-made hazards in sensitive environments. Potential hazards include catastrophic release of toxic materials into water, soil, and air; rapid and widespread transport of hazardous contaminants; and impracticable cleanup measures. Site-specific factors and facility type control the magnitude of the above-stated risks. Various approaches can be adopted to minimize potential facility damages and environmental degradation, including control of the facility's location and design conservatism. Since a host of economic and administrative factors are important to hazardous waste facility siting, the provision of incentives to facility planners to adopt good siting practices may enhance the implementation of siting plans that reduce risk. Several environments are assessed for their sensitivity to damages from hazardous waste installations. Measures of minimizing risk through location and design controls are discussed.

AB Recent epidemiological studies have consistently shown that panic disorder, according to DSM-III, occurs in adults with a lifetime prevalence of about 2% and a 6-month prevalence of about 1.2%. Panic attacks are relatively common, with a lifetime rate of about 9%. Being female and divorced and separated is associated with higher prevalence of panic disorder. The hazard rates for panic disorder were highest between the ages of 25 and 34 years for females and between the ages of 30 and 44 years for males. Panic disorder frequently co-occurs with other anxiety disorders as well as with a wide range of mental disorders such as depression and substance use disorder. Based on few epidemiological studies, panic disorder has been found to have a chronic course with rare complete remission. Subjects with panic disorder were at an increased risk of social impairment, not getting along with their partners, as well as being financially dependent, and were likely to report fair or poor global physical health, and emotional health. Cases with panic disorder had the most severe psychosocial impairment and the worst outcome as compared to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, they are high users of all types of medical services, including mental health and general medical providers. Although recent epidemiological data, with its improved methodology, have considerably increased our knowledge concerning panic attack, panic disorder and agoraphobia, there are still major questions concerning the etiology, natural history, prevention, or control of panic disorder that need to be answered. Furthermore, since panic disorder has been considered as developing in stages, our current epidemiological knowledge cannot tell us in sufficient detail about the specific role of suggested risk factors in the development of panic disorder through its various stages.

AB We obtained data from 111 gay men who entered a longitudinal study of the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) without clinical evidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and examined them regularly over a 36-month period. Using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model to compare cumulative risk of mortality in subjects with and without cognitive impairment and several putative risk factors present at baseline, we found that the mortality risk ratio (RR) associated with poor neuropsychologic test performance was significantly increased (RR = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 7.8), and increased further (RR = 4.1; 95% Cl, 1.3 to 12.5) when adjusted for other factors associated with mortality (a history of a disturbance in movement or pit, CD4-lymphocyte and red blood-cell counts, and age). A significant increase in symptoms related to cognitive impairment and gait, a decline in neuropsychologic test performance, and declines in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts occurred over the study period. A second model was constructed to adjust for changes in CD4-lymphocyte and red-cell counts, age, medical stage, and motor symptoms over the study period, but the mortality RR for poor neuropsychologic test performance at baseline changed very little (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.5 to 14.9). We conclude that the presence of cognitive impairment, manifest by poor neuropsychologic test performance in both asymptomatic and symptomatic gay men with HIV infection, is associated with a significantly increased risk of death. This effect progresses in parallel with the immunologic and systemic effects of HIV.

TI A SYSTEMS VIEW OF INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural hazards and human activities in the coastal zone are threatening the integrity of the coastal resource system.
   Conflicts of interest between short term economic benefits and long term ecologic assets should be identified and solved by means of a balanced CZM approach.
   Systems analysis, supported by mathematical modelling tools are the appropriate instruments to assist the coastal zone manager.
   The paper presents a general system description of the coastal zone, and focuses on the modelling of the natural subsystem components of this system as a first step towards a model for Integrated Coastal Management (ICM).

TI ENGINEERING GEOLOGY OF NORTH LANTAU, HONG-KONG
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Results of an engineering geology study of the northern part of Lantau Island in the west of Hong Kong are described. Over the next few years this area will be subject to major changes as a result of the planned new international airport at Chek Lap Kok. As a consequence of the airport, high-speed road and rail links are also planned along the coast of North Lantau, together with two new towns, industrial developments and a major port development at the eastern end. The study identified specific engineering geological problems and hazards with major safety or economic implications for the planned developments.
   The western end of the island is mostly rugged mountainous terrain with elevations rising to more than 900 m above sea level. Towards the east, the topography is more subdued, although hillslopes are generally still steep.
   The solid geology of the area is dominated by volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks of Mesozoic age, including volcanic tuffs and lava, granites and quartzphyric and feldsparphyric rhyolite dykes. These have weathered and a mantle of saprolite and residual soil covers much of the terrain. The onshore superficial soils include colluvium and alluvium whilst offshore, thick deposits of Holocene marine muds and Pleistocene alluvium overlie the weathered bedrock.
   The main geological and geotechnical constraints to development on land in the North Lantau area are: the possible adverse effect of relict joints on the stability of cut slopes, potential stability problems on natural slopes due to steep, colluvium covered slopes, boulder fields and the possible remobilization of colluvium within drainage courses during rainstorms. Difficulties may also be encountered with piled foundations due to the presence of large boulders in deposits of alluvium and colluvium. Offshore, the presence of thick deposits of compressible marine mud represents the main difficulty for the planned reclamations along the coastline.

TI RADIOLOGICAL HAZARD FROM COAL-FIRED POWER-PLANTS IN POLAND
SO RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY
LA English
DT Article
AB The aim of this study was to assess the radiological hazard to the Polish population due to coal combustion for electric power production. The activity concentrations of elementary radionuclides in fly ashes from ten power plants were measured. The ATMO computer program was applied to calculate the annual increase of activity concentration in the air and of annual increase of activity fallout on the ground. Exposure by inhalation, oral ingestion and external irradiation was taken into account. The assessed values of individual dose equivalent for the critical group is 0.1 mSv per year, i.e. 4% of the total dose rate from natural radiation. The collective effective dose equivalent received annually from all sources by all the inhabitants of Poland as a consequence of coal combustion in Polish CPP is estimated to be about 370 man.Sv.y-1 (47 man.Sv per GW.y), i.e. 0.4% of the dose from natural radiation.

AB The activity level of the gamma-emitting radionuclides was measured in the different component of Ismailia Canal (bottom sediment, biota and water) by gamma-spectrometry. The average activity level of the dry samples ranged from 12 to 89 Bq/kg for the detected natural radionuclides. The annual external gamma-dose to the living organisms in the canal, close to the sediment beds, was found to be in the range of 1.21 +/- 0.24 mSv/y and does not present any significant hazards when compared with the natural gamma-ray background around the Ismalia Canal (IC) environment which ranges from 0.80 to 1.73 mSv/y.

AB Recently, natural and social scientists have pointed out that the need to make scientific results apply to both sexes is not met by simply adding women as research subjects. They suggest that the social and biological specificity of both sexes must be recognized and adjustments made to the ways questions are asked, hypotheses am generated, research subjects are chosen, and data are analysed. It is important to examine the definitions, concepts and methods used in research in occupational health to see whether they obstruct recognition of women's occupational health problems or interfere with gender-neutral standard setting. Unravelling the effects of sex on occupational health is complicated by the fact that women and men do not, by and large, work at the same jobs. Definitions of ''work'' must in some cases be adjusted to take account of women's occupations, just as definitions involving ''health'' must include women's biological specificity. Appropriate changes must be made to generate sex-inclusive definitions of exposures to occupational hazards and of health effects. Methods for evaluating exposures typical of women's work must be developed. Women and their work must be appropriately included when standards for occupational exposures are set. If these adjustments are not made, women's occupational health problems will be seriously underestimated and understanding of health problems of both sexes will be hindered. Sociological analysis should also be done to reveal the mechanisms by which biassed concepts and procedures develop and are reinforced.

ID JAMUNA FLOODPLAIN; EROSION HAZARD; FLOODS; ADJUSTMENTS
AB Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country experienced four abnormally high floods. This study examines causes and impacts of the 1988 flood and evaluates the range of possible human adjustments in mitigating such hazards. Although deforestation and other human modifications of the natural environment, through implementation of flood-related engineering schemes along the upstream reaches of the rivers, may partially cause abnormal floods in the downstream zones, the physical and geographical characteristics of the region provide much of the explanation. It is argued that physical prevention of floods, through means of ''technological fix,'' is likely to pose serious threats to long-term sustainability of floodplain ecology and sociocultural resources of Bangladesh.

AB The natural radioactivity has been determined in the ceramic products manufactured in various industries in the city of Lahore (Pakistan) and its surroundings using a HPGe (high purity germanium) based spectrometry system. The activity due to potassium-40 varies from 144.10 +/- 24.37 Bq kg-1 to 834.00 +/- 31.69 Bq kg-1 with an average value of 403.46 +/- 5.64 Bq kg-1. For radium-226, the values of specific activity vary from 63.06 +/- 3.48 Bq kg-1 to 123.90 +/- 5.42 Bq kg-1 and the average value is 83.43 +/- 0.90 Bq kg-1. In case of thorium-232, the specific activity varies from 10.02 +/- 4.88 Bq kg-1 to 124.50 +/- 4.44 Bq kg-1 and the average value is 85.84 +/- 0.88 Bq kg-1. The radium equivalent activity (Ra(eq)) and the hazard indices have also been determined. The maximum value of radium equivalent activity is 319.00 +/- 9.51 Bq kg-1. The maximum value of external hazard index (H(ex)) is less than unity. The average value of the internal hazard index (H(ex)) has been found to be approaching to unity, but for some samples it is greater than unity. The Ra(eq), H(in) and H(ex) determined for the ceramic samples are compared with the values determined for other construction materials used in the same area. It has been observed that these quantities are the largest in the ceramic samples.

AB Background and Methods. To examine the clinical course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in injection-drug users, we conducted a prospective study of a cohort of patients in a methadone-treatment program in New York City from July 1985 through December 1990. The patients underwent standardized evaluations at base line and semiannually thereafter and received on-site primary medical care. Rates of progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and major outcomes before the development of AIDS were examined by univariate analyses; the risk of AIDS was also assessed by product-limit survival analysis and proportional-hazards regression.
   Results. Of 318 HIV-seropositive patients who did not yet have AIDS (171 men and 147 women), 90 were black, 179 were Hispanic, and 49 were white; the median age was 33 years. Over a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 55 (17 percent) received a diagnosis of AIDS (incidence per 100 person-years, 5.8). Major outcomes before the development of AIDS included oral candidiasis (incidence per 100 person-years, 11.2), pyogenic bacterial infections including pneumonia and sepsis (8.0), pulmonary tuberculosis (1.2), multiple constitutional symptoms (13.6), and herpes zoster (1.3). There were 41 deaths from AIDS, and 13 seropositive patients without AIDS (4.1 percent) died of bacterial infections, as compared with only 1 of 411 seronegative patients studied (P<0.001). The incidence of AIDS was 62 percent lower among those who took zidovudine than among those who did not (P = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis, progression to AIDS was best predicted by low numbers and percentages of CD4+ lymphocytes, nonuse of zidovudine, and the presence of oral candidiasis, bacterial infections, or tuberculosis. There was no consistent relation between progression to disease and the continued use of injection drugs.
   Conclusions. HIV-infected injection-drug users have progression to AIDS at rates comparable to those of other HIV-infected groups, but they have substantial pre-AIDS morbidity and mortality, particularly from bacterial infections, which also appear to predict disease progression.

TI THE POTENTIAL FOR TERATOGENICITY OF VITAMIN-A AND ITS CONGENERS

AB Objective: To review the evidence for teratogenic potential associated with the use of vitamin A and synthetic retinoids in Australia.
   Data sources: Relevant indexed journal articles and standard drug information reference texts were identified by Medline and library search. Information was also obtained from the Australian National Perinatal Statistics Unit.
   Data extraction: We summarised human and animal data relating to the terstogenicity of vitamin A derivatives and synthetic retinoids, including case reports documenting systemic effects from topically administered drugs, pertinent information relating to the clinical pharmacokinetics and adverse of these compounds, and the approved and potential indications for the use of these agents. Data synthesis: Extensive experimental evidence points to the teratogenicity of natural and synthetic retinoids in animals. Data confirming an effect in humans are not as good. Nevertheless case series, cass reports and some epidemiological data regarding isotretinoin suggest that synthetic retinoids are similarly teratogenic in humans. Although there are extensive guidelines and legislation dealing with the use of these compounds in the United States and Australia, the potential for teratogenicity induced by vitamin A still exists. Thia is because retinoids and vitamin A continue to be prescribed for women of child-bearing potential and documented evidence from the United States reveals that not all prescribers comply with recommendations that minimise the risk of malformations. Non-prescription forms of vitamin A are available without a pregnancy hazard warning, and potentially teratogenic amounts are available from dietry sources.
   Conclusions: There exists a potential for teratogenicity in association with the use of both synthetic and natural retinoids in Australia. Monitoring systems currently in place in this country may not detect these malformations should they occur.

TI AIRBORNE FIBER CONCENTRATIONS IN A GLASS CONTINUOUS FILAMENT FACTORY
SO ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE
LA English
DT Article
ID FIBER
AB Studies of the mortality of workers employed in the glass continuous filament produCtion industry have been completed in an attempt to study any cancer risks in the industry. Exposure measurements made in these factories have shown verv low respirable fibre concentrations, some of which were of man-made vitreous fibres (MMVF) although most were of natural non-asbestos mineral fibres. In an attempt further to investigate the exposure in these factories an analytical method based on scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS) was developed. The objective of this technique was to enable the various MMVF varieties to be differentiated. The method was applied to samples collected in a glass continuous filament plant. The majority of respirable fibres found on the samples were calcium sulphate. organic fibres, asbestos or glass wool. Thirteen fibres out of 67 analysed had morphology consistent with MMVF. From their compositions, five were almost certainly glass wool but only one of these could possibly have been a glass continuous filament. However, unequivocal identification of this fibre was not possible, because of the wide range in compositions for other man-made mineral fibres. The results of this investigation call into question the ability of any workplace epidemiological study to investigate the potential respiratory cancer hazard from glass continuous filaments.

AB Gilbert White has had a profound influence on natural resources and hazards research, but the philosophy that guides his work has not been dearly defined. White's approach has broad affinities with the pragmatic tradition of American social thought, most notably with the work of John Dewey. This paper compares four major themes in the work of White and Dewey: the precariousness of existence, the pragmatic conception of inquiry, learning from experience, and discourse and democracy. For each theme, I show how similarities and differences between White and Dewey can help to clarify controversies within geography, and directions for future research.

AB The carcinogenic effect of three UVA tanning sources was studied in lightly pigmented hairless mice. The three tanning sources (Bellarium-S SA-1-12, Philips TL 09R and Philips TL 10R) have different emission spectra, and emit different amounts of UVB. Radiation from the tanning sources was administered for 20 min/day, 5 day/week in daily doses equivalent to those used in suntan salons. The radiation was given alone or after 12 weeks of exposure to solar-simulated UV radiation (SOLAR UV) (10 min/day, 4 day/week; daily dose, 19.5 kJ/m2 UVA and 3.9 kJ/m2 UVB). Irradiation with Bellarium-S SA-1-12 for 47 weeks and Philips TL 09R for 74 weeks induced skin tumours in 20/20 and 13/20 of the animals, respectively. When irradiation with Bellarium-S SA-1-12 and Philips TL 09R was administered after 12 weeks of SOLAR-UV exposure, a strong enhancement of SOLAR-UV-induced photocarcinogenesis was observed (p < 0.001). Irradiation with Philips TL 10R was only slightly carcinogenic, and during 85 weeks of irradiation only one skin tumor appeared in a group of 20 mice. However, when irradiation with Philips TL 10R was administered after 12 weeks of exposure to SOLAR UV, an enhancement of SOLAR-UV-induced carcinogenesis was observed (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that the hazards of exposure to commercial tanning devices are increased when they are used after a period of natural sun exposure. Even tanning sources with a low carcinogenic potential are able to increase SOLAR-UV-induced carcinogenesis significantly.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF RADIOACTIVE PETROLEUM PIPING SCALE WITH AN
   EVALUATION OF SUBSEQUENT LAND CONTAMINATION
SO HEALTH PHYSICS
LA English

DE SCALING; RA-226; RADON; RADIOACTIVITY, NATURAL
AB Scale formation in oilfield piping and equipment has been a problem for petroleum companies. In the past, scale waste from cleaning of piping and equipment has been considered nonhazardous. Naturally occurring radioactive material in the form of Ra-226 and, to a lesser degree, Ra-228 with their associated decay products have recently been discovered in the scale. Due to the lower abundance and short half-life, Ra-228 is not addressed in this paper. Ra-226, an alpha emitter, is a potential internal hazard to workers from the inhalation and ingestion of the dust produced during descaling or pipe cleaning operations. Along with this, a higher-than-normal background gamma exposure rate is seen where the pipe cleaning was routinely done. An evaluation of the radiation hazards associated with a retired pipe cleaning field was performed. Gamma exposure rates, Ra-226 concentration, and Ra-226 leachability were examined using scale containing soil from the field. Radon emanation from the soil was also determined.

AB Data were analyzed from a multicenter observational cohort study of 1002 persons with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and total CD4 cell count <0.25 x 10(9)/L treated with zidovudine between April 1987 and April 1988. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease developed in 109 patients (10.9%), with a 2-year actuarial risk of 15%. Manifestations included retinitis (93 patients), esophagitis (10), colitis (8), gastritis (1), hepatitis (1), and encephalitis (1). The probability of CMV disease at 2 years for patients with initial counts <0. 1 x 10(9)/L was 21.4%, compared with 10.3% for patients with initial counts greater-than-or-equal-to 0.1 x 10(9)/L (P < .001). By proportional hazards analysis, baseline CD4 cell count <0.1 x 10(9)/L, enrollment diagnosis of AIDS, and homosexuality were significantly associated with subsequently developing CMV disease. Median survival after diagnosis of CMV disease was 173 days, and CMV was an independent predictor of death. CMV contributes to AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. As new anti-CMV drugs become available, prophylaxis should be targeted at individuals with CD4 cell counts <0. 1 x 10(9)/L.

TI MYTHS OF NATURE - CULTURE AND THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF RISK
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTION
AB Western cultures are engaged in a highly contentious debate involving the identification, assessment, and management of risks to the environment and to public health and safety. Daily claims of new dangers in the food, air, and water we consume, the chemicals, energy, and substances we use, and the products, processes, and artifacts that support us are exacerbating public fears regarding environmental and health hazards. Most research on the perception and communication of risk has focused on possible harms, largely ignoring the cultural contexts in which hazards are framed and debated, and in which risk taking and risk perception occur. This article argues that, while individuals perceive risks and have concerns, it is culture that provides socially constructed myths about nature-systems of belief that are reshaped and internalized by persons, becoming part of their worldview and influencing their interpretation of natural phenomena.

LA English
DT Article
AB Natural gamma-ray radioactivities have been measured in cement samples from several factories in Pakistan. Gamma-ray spectrometry with a HPGe detector and PC based MCA was used for data acquisition and analysis. The minimum, maximum and the average values of specific gamma-ray activities have been determined for K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232. The specific activity for K-40 varied between 41.4 +/- 34.4 Bq kg-1 and 308.7 +/- 32.5 Bq kg-1. For Ra-226 the specific activity varied between 17.5 +/- 3.3 Bq kg-1 and 60.3 +/- 3.6 Bq kg-1. The range of activities for Th-232 was between 15.6 +/- 2.2 Bq kg-1 and 50.8 +/- 3.9 Bq kg-1. Radium equivalent activities (Ra(eq)) and hazard indices were also calculated. The maximum value of Ra(eq) was 117.8 Bq kg-1 and this is lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg-1.

TI THE POLISH ENVIRONMENTAL SYNDROME - ENVIRONMENTAL-PROBLEMS AND WAYS TO
   APPROACH THEM
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The environmental degradation observed in several regions of Poland has reached the level of an ecological hazard. The presence of its rich natural resources should create a blessing for the country and bring welfare to its people. Instead, the complicated history of Poland and the political and economic system put in place after the Second World War have created the present economic and environmental problems. This paper gives basic data reflecting the complexity of the Polish situation. It touches also upon present threats to society and the environment, as well as highlighting possibilities that still are open. The present Polish dilemma is how to rank priorities when the need to tackle existing environmental problems is confronted with several other mainly economic, problems. One most important action that must be taken now is the transfer of modern ideas and approaches that would enable an efficient fight against environmental degradation. Wide application of modern knowledge and approaches is a crucial condition for choosing correct actions.

   PROCESSES
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY AND WATER SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Conceptual equations are presented for the net benefits, total risk, and total vulnerability associated with hazard zone occupation. It is shown that, as they are polycausal phenomena, landslides require a more sophisticated approach to this form of analysis than that employed for most other forms of hazard.
   Three examples of landsliding are examined. At Cuyocuyo, in the Peruvian Cordillera Oriental, slope instability is virtually inevitable, but human intervention may be disturbing some very fragile natural equilibria. At Calciano, in southern Italy, deforestation has resulted in a mudflow disaster, although man-made factors are not the only causes at work. Finally, in the Valle dell'Orco (also in southern Italy) demographic and agrarian change have aided the partial metamorphosis of the catchment into a large-scale mudflow complex (although the longer-term causes are natural, tectonic ones). These examples illustrate parts of the continuum that extends from dominant natural to dominant anthropogenic causes.
   Human intervention has played a key role in stimulating the natural antecedents of landslides occurring in the study areas. It is concluded that risk perception has not been wide enough to promote adequate risk mitigation, in part because of a failure properly to conceive of landslides as polycausal phenomena, in which man-made causes effectively cannot-and should not-be separated from natural ones.

AB N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) were evaluated in the allohexapolyploid wheat seedling assay developed by Redei and Sandhu (1988), for its ability to induce aneuploidy and/or small chromosome deletions. The wheat strain used (Neatby's virescent) is homozygous for a pair of recessive alleles (v1) present on chromosome 3B and produces virescent seedlings grown at temperatures below 26-degrees-C. When the developing embryos are treated with a test chemical, loss of chromosome 3B or its segment bearing the v1 allele in a progenitor cell produces a green sector in the leaf, whereas a gain of this chromosome induces a white sector. ENU and 4NQO induced dose-dependent increases in the frequency of leaf sectors at concentrations ranging from 0.128 to 1.280 mM and 0.052 to 0.263 mM, respectively. The assay is very simple and can be employed for evaluating the genetic potential of chemicals in a laboratory as well as for in situ hazards assessment under natural environmental conditions.

AB Recent outcome analyses in ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) have included patients undergoing electrophysiological study (EPS) at tertiary care centers. The selection process involved could introduce bias in the reported populations. We analyzed the outcome of 42 consecutive patients (aged 63 +/- 11 years) admitted to a coronary care unit within 48 hours of a first episode of VT/VF not associated with reversible causes. All patients recovered neurologically and were candidates for EPS. Nine patients (21%) died during the initial hospitalization (none had EPS), and another nine died during a follow-up of 17 +/- 12 months. Actuarial survival at 1 and 2 years was 64% and 62%, respectively. By Cox's model, congestive heart failure functional Class III-IV (P = 0.008; hazard ratio = 3.7) was the only independent prognostic factor. Among patients discharged, subsequent survival did not depend on the performance of EPS or on the antiarrhythmic therapeutic modalities used. Mortality after a first episode of VT/VF is high. Severe congestive heart failure is the most powerful prognostic factor. Studies including successfully referred patients undergoing EPS may not reflect the true natural history of patients with VT/VF.

AB Invasive carcinoma of the cervix was treated in 1 522 patients over a 10-year period at Groote Schuur Hospital. Data for each patient included place of residence, pathological characteristics of the tumour, nodal spread, histological evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, disease stage, treatment type, treatment complications, site of recurrence and survival time. Patients aged under 35 years comprised 11,6% of the total patient group. A retrospective cohort study compared women aged under 35 years of age at the time of entry into the study and women aged 35 years or more. In all, 82 eligible young patients were compared with a random sample of 82 eligible older patients. Contingency tables, life tables and proportional hazards analysis were used where appropriate. There was no significant difference across the two age groups in the incidence of non-squamous tumours, or in the grades of squamous tumours. Similarly there was no evidence of differences in lymph node involvement or HPV infection.
   Young patients appeared to enter the study at significantly earlier stages of the disease, and a greater proportion of them underwent surgical treatment (diff = 36,4% +/- 13,5%). In both groups treatment complications were less frequently observed after surgery than after radiotherapy. Sites of tumour recurrence were similar in both groups, and there was no apparent difference in survival times.

AB The human diet contains an enormous background of natural chemicals, such as plant pesticides and the products of cooking, that have not been a focus of carcinogenicity testing. A broadened perspective that includes these natural chemicals is necessary. A comparison of possible hazards for 80 daily exposures to rodent carcinogens from a variety of sources is presented, using an index (HERP) that relates human exposure to carcinogenic potency in rodents. A similar ordering would be expected with the use of standard risk assessment methodology for the same human exposure values. Results indicate that, when viewed against the large background of naturally occurring carcinogens in typical portions of common foods, the residues of synthetic pesticides or environmental pollutants rank low. A similar result is obtained in a separate comparison of 32 average daily exposures to natural pesticides and synthetic pesticide residues in the diet. Although the findings do not indicate that these natural dietary carcinogens are important in human cancer, they cast doubt on the relative importance for human cancer of low-dose exposures to synthetic chemicals.

AB The photo-induced toxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), anthracene, to the green alga, Selenastrum capricornutum, was characterized. The dose-response relationships among anthracene concentration, ultraviolet (UV) radiation intensity, and algal growth rate and C-14-bicarbonate incorporation were determined. The 22 h EC50 for specific growth rate was inversely related to UV-A radiation intensity and ranged from 37.4 to 3.9-mu-g/L anthracene. For C-14-bicarbonate incorporation on a volume basis (primary production), the 24 h EC50 ranged from 24.0 to 3.3-mu-g/L anthracene depending on the UV-A intensity. The incorporation of C-14-bicarbonate on a per cell basis (cellular photosynthesis) was more resistant than cell growth or primary production. The threshold for photo-induced toxicity of anthracene was 1.5-3-mu-g/L anthracene, however, no UV-A radiation threshold was evident for many of the measurements of toxicity studied. Algae appeared to be slightly more resistant to photo-induced toxicity of anthracene than fishes and invertebrates. An environmental hazard assessment suggests that some aquatic systems are sufficiently contaminated by PAH that a hazard to natural algal communities due to photo-induced toxicity of PAH may be present.

TI ESTIMATING HIV PREVALENCE AND PROJECTING AIDS INCIDENCE IN THE

AB The AIDS incubation distribution is changing in calendar time because of treatment and changes in the surveillance definition of AIDS. To obtain reliable estimates of HIV prevalence and projections of AIDS incidence in the 1990s using the method of backcalculation, we constructed an appropriate incubation distribution for each calendar date of infection.
   We parameterized the impact of treatment on the incubation distribution by specifying the relative hazard for AIDS in treated versus untreated people as a function of duration of HIV infection. To account for trends in the incubation distribution, we modelled the prevalence of treatment, the distribution of treatment onset times, and the impact of the revision of the AIDS surveillance definition in 1987. We selected and evaluated backcalculation models based on consistency with external information. We defined a 'plausible range' of estimates that took into account uncertainty about the natural incubation distribution and treatment efficacy, as well as bootstrap assessment of stochastic error.
   Using these methods, we projected that national United States AIDS incidence will plateau during 1991-1994 at over 50,000 cases per year. Projections exhibited substantial systematic uncertainty, and we calculated a plausible range for AIDS incidence in 1994 of 42,300 to 70,700 cases. An estimated 628,000 to 988,000 cumulative HIV infections occurred as of 1 January 1991. After accounting for AIDS mortality, we estimated that 484,000 to 844,000 people were living with HIV infection on 1 January 1991. Favourable trends in HIV incidence appeared in gay men and intravenous drug users. Plausible ranges for our estimates overlapped with those from a 'stage model' approach to incorporating treatment effects in backcalculations. Our approach, however, tended to yield smaller estimates of epidemic size, mainly because the parameters used with the stage model implied that more treatment was in use and that treatment was more effective than in our model.

AB Background. The natural history of prostatic cancer is variable. Our knowledge of prognostic factors is limited; therefore, research is needed.
   Methods. The cases of 300 population-based consecutive patients with a diagnosis of cancer of the prostate were analyzed regarding different prognostic factors (but with special reference to the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]).
   Results. After a mean observation time of 100 months, M category, ESR, grade, performance status, hemoglobin level, and T category were found to correlate with disease-specific death using multivariate analysis. The variables correlating with progression in the multivariate model were M category, ESR, T category, grade, treatment, and age. Patients treated with estrogen had a significantly lower risk (relative hazard, 0.3) of relapse. ESR was highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001) as a prognostic factor. With the variable in linear form, a 20-mm/h higher level suggested a 29% increased risk, on average, for dying of prostatic cancer (using a best-fit multivariate model). However, the relationship was not linear. After correcting for the effect of other factors, the risk for dying of prostatic cancer was lowest when the ESR was 40-50 mm/h and highest when its values were highest.
   Conclusions. ESR is an indicator of increased risk of progression and death in prostatic cancer. Other prognostic factors such as M and T categories, grade, performance status, hemoglobin level, and age currently are more important when planning treatment. It is possible that the ESR reflects aspects of tumor-host relationship and that both a low and high ESR are markers for patients with receding host defence mechanism.

AB Tributyltin (TBT) from marine antifouling paints poses an environmental hazard in natural waters. Previous studies have shown that adsorption of the compound onto sampling and analytical equipment is a problem when monitoring TBT levels. It was found in this study that adsorption is a function of the salinity of the solution. It was also found that toluene removes adsorbed TBT, and that recovery does not appear to depend on salinity, provided that sufficient time is spent shaking.

AB Foods, in addition to supplying the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals necessary to sustain life, may also contain a variety of naturally-occurring toxins in varying quantities. While some of these can present a health risk to the consuming public, usually when certain food items are not prepared properly, research has identified a beneficial role for some in helping to prevent illness. A more important risk derives from the synthetic compounds, such as pesticides, that may contaminate foods. Recent debate among scientists and government policy makers, reported widely in both the scholarly and popular press, has sought to clarify the relative public health risks presented by natural toxins versus pesticidal residues present in foods. An attempt is made here to put this debate in proper perspective. Information is given on the role played by naturally-occurring food components in promoting human health, followed by a survey of the diversity of natural toxins present in many common foods and their potential hazards. Risks associated with human exposure to pesticides are discussed, with particular reference to direct poisonings and fatalities, potential induction of cancers, and effects on reproduction and the immune and nervous systems. Natural toxins in foods do pose certain finite, irreducible risks for consumers. These risks are generally small and uncommon. Public policy efforts should be directed towards reducing any unnecessary overburden of pesticidal residues in the human diet.

AB We introduce a statistical distribution with hazard function mu(t) proportional to (psi - t)beta-1 for 0 less-than-or-equal-to t < psi and shape parameter beta satisfying 0 < beta < 1. This hazard function is suggested by a theory of aging in demography. We discuss properties of this distribution and maximum likelihood estimates of its parameters. Mixture distributions are considered to account for pooling across dissimilar populations. This model is compared with the Gompertz and generalized Pareto distributions and used to estimate a finite limit on human lifespan based on the survival of a group of female centenarians.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between chemical suppression of natural killer (NK) cell activity in mice and chemical effects on susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. The goal was to provide a rational basis for applying MCMV as a host resistance model for immunotoxicity testing and to provide risk assessors some guidance in relating suppression of NK cell activity to enhanced risk of disease. Data from studies with eight chemicals administered in various doses and by various routes were evaluated, and a significant correlation was observed between chemical suppression of virus-augmented NK cell activity and increased mortality due to MCMV infection. In contrast, effects of the same chemical treatments on spontaneous NK cell activity (i.e., basal activity in uninfected mice) did not correlate with effects of these chemicals on mortality due to MCMV Although chemicals that suppressed spontaneous NK cell activity enhanced infection, the converse was not always true-that is, increased susceptibility to infection and suppression of virus-augmented NK cell activity were observed on three occasions when spontaneous NK cell activity was unaffected. This latter phenomenon plus the fact that for two chemicals spontaneous NK was suppressed at concentrations twofold below that which affected mortality appear to account for the poor statistical correlation. Nevertheless, the data indicate that MCMV is a useful host resistance model to be applied in immunotoxicity testing when suppression of NK cell activity has been demonstrated. However virus-augmented activity may be a better indicator than spontaneous activity. The data also indicated that suppression of NK cell activity is predictive of increased susceptibility to infection and hence provides qualitative guidance (hazard identification) to risk assessors.

TI CHANNEL CHANGE AND FLOOD EVENTS SINCE 1783 ON THE REGULATED RIVER TAY,
   SCOTLAND - IMPLICATIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD MANAGEMENT
SO REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE FLOODS; CHANNEL CHANGE; EMBANKMENTS; IMPOUNDMENT
AB An analysis of old maps and documentary sources reveals that major changes in river channel planform have occurred over the last 200 years on the River Tay system, Scotland, UK. Reaches showing natural river channel planform change, however, are relatively small and a stable planform is characteristic of many sections of the river. River planform instability appears to be controlled by channel bed slope, sediment load and the enhanced vulnerability of former river channel courses to erosion. Flood protection embankments built in the 19th and 20th centuries modified unstable multichannel wandering gravel bed river sections to narrower single-channel reaches, with limited lateral migration. On the River Tummel, 20th century impoundment has caused further geomorphological change in response to clearwater erosion close to the dam and aggradation processes within the regulated river downstream, but isolation of the effects of impoundment from those of channelization are problematic. An examination of the geomorphic effects of a high magnitude flood event in 1990 and historical accounts of earlier large floods reveal that the 1990 flood was the third largest since 1800 in the study area. Despite river regulation and bank protection the zones naturally characterized by instability are still susceptible to planform changes causing flood embankments to be breached, channel shifts and development of gravel bars.

DE RISK; COMMUNICATION; EARTHQUAKE; PREDICTION
ID HURRICANE WARNINGS; REANALYSIS
AB A model of public perception and response to communication about natural hazards risk was constructed. It was estimated on data from samples of households in three communities at risk in the Parkfield earthquake prediction experiment. Estimated model parameters revealed consistent conclusions. Communicated risk information that was reinforced through additional communications and/or social cues precipitated an interactive personal search for more information; personal definitions of risk and what to do emerged; and these social constructions directed how the public responded. Perceived risk only indirectly impacted public action through information searching. This suggests that searching behavior should intervene between perception of risk and response in the theory of public risk communication.

AB Photochemical reactions contribute to abiotic degradation of pesticides and most other organic chemicals in the environment. Since most pesticides belong to the class of 'semivolatile organic compounds' (SOC), they not only have to be tested and evaluated with regard to the soil compartment, the main topic of this workshop, but also with regard to the air and water compartments. Photochemical degradation testing is on different levels of development. This level is highest for the gas phase of the atmosphere, lower for surface waters, cloud droplets and aerosols and lowest for the soil compartment. The main reason for the unsatisfactory status of development in the soil compartment is the inherent difficulty involved in working on non-homogeneous surfaces.

AB Emphasis has increased on accuracy in predicting the effect that anthropogenic stress has on natural ecosystems. Although toxicity tests low in environmental realism, such as standardized single species procedures, have been useful in providing a certain degree of protection to human health and the environment, the accuracy of such tests for predicting the effects of anthropogenic activities on complex ecosystems is questionable. The use of indigenous communities of microorganisms to assess the hazard of toxicants in aquatic ecosystems has many advantages. Theoretical and practical aspects of microbial community tests are discussed, particularly in related to widely cited problems in the use of multispecies test systems for predicting hazard. Further standardization of testing protocols using microbial colonization dynamics is advocated on the basis of previous studies, which have shown these parameters to be useful in assessing risk and impact of hazardous substances in aquatic ecosystems.

AB To determine the incidence and natural history of Mycobacterium avium-complex infections in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we studied a multicenter cohort of 1,020 persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC) and CD4 cell count < 0.250 x 10(9)/L initially treated with zidovudine between April 1987 and April 1988.  M. avium-complex infections developed in 123 (12%) patients during follow-up, with a 2-yr actuarial risk of 19%.  Patients with an initial diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were more likely to develop M. avium-complex infections than patients with an initial diagnosis of another opportunistic disease or of ARC (p = 0.002).  Individuals developing M. avium-complex infections had lower baseline CD4 cell counts, hematocrits, lymphocyte counts, and total white blood cell counts than those who did not develop M. avium-complex infection.  During follow-up, individuals who developed M. avium-complex infections were more likely to have severe anemia, to experience zidovudine dose reductions, and to die than were patients without M. avium-complex (p < 0.001).  By proportional hazards analysis, a baseline CD4 cell count < 0.100 x 10(9)/L, development of severe anemia, P. carinii peneumonia during follow-up, and zidovudine dose interruption were significantly associated with subsequently developing M. avium-complex infection.  A proportional hazards analysis of survival showed that M. avium-complex infection, severe anemia, zidovudine dose interruption, occurrence of an opportunistic infection, CD4 cell count < 0.100 x 10(9)/L, baseline AIDS diagnosis, and transfusion independently predicted an increased risk of death.  M. avium-complex infections are a common late consequence of HIV infection, particularly in persons with low CD4 cell counts and anemia.  In advanced HIV infection treated with zidovudine, M. avium-complex infection is significantly associated with the risk of death.

AB We have used the technique of backcalculation to estimate the number of persons in Canada who have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) as of July 1989. We first corrected national AIDS surveillance data in Canada for reporting delay and for underreporting. We then used standard Weibull natural history models as well as an alternative progression model in which the hazard of AIDS was dampened in keeping with observed data from large cohorts. Maximum likelihood techniques were then used to derive the infection curve most consistent with these data. Our best estimate based on this alternative progression model, an underreporting rate of 20%, and a logistic infection curve, was that approximately 29,000 persons in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. In a sensitivity analysis utilizing less likely assumptions, the estimates ranged from 17,243 to 48,277. Restricting the same backcalculation process to females under the same assumptions, we estimated that approximately 2,900 females in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. The best fitting step function infection curve in females appears to be continuing to rise. Given these estimates, it follows that approximately one in ten infected persons in Canada is female. However, females have only accounted for about one in seventeen AIDS cases. These data are in accord with the widespread impression that transmission of HIV to women has occurred more recently and is on the rise across Canada.
   The current estimate is lower than previous estimates which placed the number of infected Canadians in the 50,000 to 100,000 range. This lowering should not be taken to mean the situation is improving; rather, the early estimates were simply too high having been based on inadequate data and a rudimentary understanding of the natural history of HIV.
   Backcalculation is an excellent technique for modelling the incidence of HIV infection several years in the past, but it is not reliable for the most recent few years. A significant increase in HIV infection rates may have occurred in the past few years and it would be beyond the capacity of backcalculation to detect. Backcalculation and unlinked cross-sectional specimen surveys together have the potential to provide an effective means of monitoring the HIV epidemic.

AB Field evaluations were made of a baiting system designed for use by regulatory agencies in suppressing populations of undesirable feral honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (e.g., bees posing hazards [especially Africanized bees] and colonies infested with parasitic mites). Bees from feral or simulated feral (hived) colonies were lured with honey and Nasonov pheromone components to feeders dispensing sucrose-honey syrup. After 1-3 wk of passive training to feeders, colonies were treated during active foraging by replacing untreated syrup with syrup containing 500 ppm (mg/liter) acephate (Orthene 75 S). In four trials using hived colonies on Grand Terre Island, La., 21 of 29 colonies foraged actively enough at baits to be treated, and 20 of the 21 treated were destroyed. In the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (two trials at each of two sites), treatments killed 11 of 16 colonies (6 of 10 hived; 5 of 6 feral). Overall results showed that all 11 colonies that collected >25 mg acephate died, whereas 3 of 10 colonies receiving less-than-or-equal-to 25 mg survived. Delivering adequate doses required a minimum of almost-equal-to 100 bees per target colony simultaneously collecting treated syrup. The system destroyed target colonies located up to nearly 700 m away from baits. Major factors limiting efficacy were conditions inhibiting foraging at baits (e.g., competing natural nectar sources and temperatures and winds that restricted bee flight).

AB Some pre-feasibility results from the design evaluations of the advanced high temperature reactor AHTR for process heat applications are given, e.g. coating of the spherical fuel elements with silicon carbide as a fission product barrier, design of the central graphite column and the graphite top reflector without any metallic structure, after heat removal system based on natural convection for the primary and secondary circuit, venturi jets to reduce the depressurization rate of the helium in case of damage to the primary ducts etc.. On the basis of these results it is possible in the future, that AHTR can be designed in such a way, that any type of damage of the plant or due to any operator error, poses no hazard to the public.
   With these design perspectives and attendant simplification of the plant design, it is possible to reduce the investment costs by 10 to 15%, so that the economic competitiveness of AHTR will improve in the future.
   It has been further shown, that coal gasification with a high temperature reactor reduces CO2-emissions by a factor of about two by the methanol production and also by the electricity generation in comparison to the conventional methods.

AB The Medical Research Council's Glomerulonephritis Registry was used to study clinico-pathological correlations and renal survival in patients with IgA nephropathy reported between 1978 and 1985. IgA nephropathy was the histological diagnosis in 9.3 per cent of all renal biopsies reported to the registry during this period, and in 18.1 per cent of those with a primary glomerulonephritis. The 10-year cumulative renal survival rate accounting for censored data (Kaplan-Meier) was 83.3 per cent. Univariate analysis of survival curves (log-rank test) found the following parameters to be significantly correlated, with poor renal survival: serum creatinine > 120 mumol/l (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.001), serum albumin < 40 g/l (p < 0.005), proteinuria > 1 g (p < 0.025), age > 30 years (p < 0.025), and focal mesangial proliferation (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in renal survival between males and females. Multivariate analysis (Cox's proportional hazards model) revealed that only a serum creatinine of > 120 mumol/l and a serum albumin of < 40 g/l were independently predictive of outcome.
   These findings indicate marked similarities between the UK experience of IgA nephropathy and the published European experience. IgA nephropathy is not a benign condition in the UK and patients with impaired renal function and/or those with a reduced serum albumin are significantly more likely to progress to end-stage renal failure within 10 years.

AB Objective: To describe the prognosis of individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in a population-based sample and to compare this with the prognosis of patients in a previous referral center case series of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Population-based in Olmsted County, Minnesota.
   Patients: Forty residents of Olmstead County, Minnesota with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy initially diagnosed between 1975 and 1984 who were followed through 1 July 1989 and 104 patients from a Mayo Clinic referral case series from 1960 to 1973.
   Measurements: Survival for the population-based cohort at 1 year and 5 years.
   Results: Survival at 1 year differed dramatically between the population-based cohort and the referral case series at 1 year (95% compared with 69%, respectively) and at 5 years (80% compared with 36%, respectively) (P < 0.001). Long-term survival for the population-based cohort was nonetheless impaired when compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort, that is, the 1980 Minnesota white population (8-year survival: observed, 58% compared with expected, 83%; P < 0.001). Among community patients, older age (adjusted Cox model hazard ratio for 10-year increase in age, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.35) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio for 10% decrease, 1.90; CI, 1.04 to 3.50) were independently associated with impaired survival.
   Conclusions: These population-based data challenge the clinical perception of the clinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy based on referral practice prognostic studies and suggest that the clinical course of this condition may be more favorable than previously recognized.

AB Man's activity in space has generated significant amounts of debris that remain in orbit for periods of sufficient duration to become a hazard to future space activities. In the past, the debris has been generated by inadvertent explosions of upper stages and spacecraft, by intentional explosions for military reasons, and possibly by a few breakups resulting from collisions. In the future, debris can be generated by collisions among spacecraft as the number of orbital objects continues to grow at rates greater than natural forces remove them from orbit. There are design and operations practices that can minimize the inadvertent generation of debris. There are other design and operations options for removing objects from space at the end of their useful service so they are not available as a source for the generation of future debris. Those studies are the primary concern of this paper. The issues are different in the low Earth orbits and in the geosynchronous orbits. In low Earth orbit, the hazards generated by potential collisions among spacecraft are severe because the events would take place at such high velocities. In geosynchronous orbit, the collision consequence is not so severe, because the relative velocities are low- < 1 km/s. But, because of the value of the limited arc and the extremely long lifetime of the satellites, it is necessary to remove any debris generated in the orbit to a different orbit at the end of life if it is to be no hazard to future operational spacecraft. The issue at present seems to be how high the reboost maneuver must be and what the maneuver strategy should be to ensure its effectiveness. The most economic removal of objects is achieved when those objects have the capability to execute the necessary maneuvers with their own systems and resources. The most costly option is to have some other system remove the spacecraft after it has become a derelict. Numerous options are being studied to develop systems and techniques that can remove spacecraft from useful orbits at the end of their useful life and do so for the least mass penalty and economic cost.

AB OBJECTIVE:  Our objective was to provide information on survival and disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus antibody-positive pregnant women undergoing prospective evaluation.
   STUDY DESIGN:  After an index delivery, 103 human immunodeficiency virus antibody-positive pregnant women were identified and underwent follow-up for 3 years.  The patients were assessed medically and/or gynecologically when hospitalized for a human immunodeficiency virus-related illness or at each follow-up visit.  The life-table method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of survival and remaining free of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  Cox's proportional-hazards analyses were used to identify prognostic factors for survival and progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
   RESULTS:  The majority of human immunodeficiency virus-infected pregnant women were alive 3 years later.  Lymphadenopathy syndrome or herpes genitalis was significantly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  Of the 103 original patients, six had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at the index delivery and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 24.  Approximately 94% of evaluable patients with development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome had CD4-lymphocyte counts < 200/mm3.  The most common opportunistic infection was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and postpartum zidovudine therapy were independent prognostic factors affecting survival.
   CONCLUSION:  Survival was affected by Centers for Disease Control group status of human immunodeficiency virus infection at the index delivery.

AB Background and Methods. The records of 118 patients who had hepatic resections for colorectal liver metastases were analyzed retrospectively.
   Results. The patient group, from 15 institutions in The Netherlands, was found to have a 5-year actuarial survival rate of 21% and a 5-year actuarial disease-free survival rate of 19%. The postoperative mortality rate was 7.6%. In the remaining group, the morbidity rate was 34.7%. A number of factors were examined that were reported to be of prospective significance in other studies. In the multivariate proportional hazard model of Cox, the number of metastases (P = 0.001) and the amount of perioperative blood loss (P = 0.002) were related significantly to disease-free survival. A factor that may be considered a contraindication to resection is the presence of extrahepatic disease (whether nodal or visceral), even if resectable.
   Conclusions. Although the actual benefit of resection is limited, and it is associated with considerable morbidity, surgical therapy offers some patients a chance for cure. It is a valid expectation that improvement in techniques and a proper understanding of hepatic anatomy will improve the safety and efficacy of hepatic resections in the future. Future research should focus on defining better selection criteria and on study of the value of adjuvant treatment modalities.

DT Article
AB The 1990s have been declared the "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" (IDNDR) by the United Nations. This paper presents a global analysis of the nature and distribution of natural hazard losses since the Second World War. Regional disparities in loss experience are highlighted, in particular the contrasts between developed and developing regions. The paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of future disaster potential, through analysis of exposure of the world's 100 largest urban agglomerations (accomodating 10 per cent of the global population) to earthquake and windstorm hazards. We are currently witnessing an increase in exposure to these hazards, coupled with escalating potential for catastrophic loss.

AB A cohort of 544 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) seropositive intravenous drug users (IVDUs) was recruited in 1988 and early 1989; data on laboratory markers, clinical symptoms, intravenous drug use, and demographics were collected. Forty-one IVDUs developed AIDS within 2 years of enrollment. Data were analyzed using methods of survival analysis. None of the individuals reported use of antiviral agents or Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis at baseline. A very strong (p < 0.001) dose-response relationship was identified between CD4 cell count at baseline and the subsequent development of AIDS. In multivariate analysis, both the presence of more than one clinical HIV-1-related symptom and serum neopterin > 12 nmol/L showed significant associations with the relative hazard (95% confidence interval) of AIDS after controlling for CD4 of 2.9 (1.6, 5.6) and 2.0 (1.0, 3.7), respectively. In these IVDUs, serum beta-2-microglobulin did not add predictive power for progression to AIDS. The effect of clinical symptoms was stronger for high CD4 cell counts, indicating the need to monitor HIV seropositive IVDUs with both laboratory studies and clinical evaluation.

   INDEXES
AB Studies have been carried out to determine the natural radioactivity in the building materials used for construction of dwellings in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The measurements have been carried out on samples of bricks, cement, gravel aggregates, sand. soil and paints using a HPGe based gamma-ray spectrometer. In all the material S-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 have been found; in paints activity was below the detectable limits. The overall activity (sum of activities) from K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 in brick and soil samples was the highest and the lowest was found in gravel aggregate samples. The average activity of K-40 varies from 51.3 +/- 3.8 Bq kg-1 (gravel aggregates) to 631.2 +/- 6.5 Bq kg-1 (brick); Ra-226 varied from 21.5 +/- 0.5 Bq kg-1 (sand) to 43.2 +/- 0.6 Bq kg-1 (bricks); Th-232 varied from 9.9 +/- 0.6 Bq kg-1 (gravel aggregates) to 56.2 +/- 1.7 Bq kg-1 (soil). Radium equivalent activities with external and internal hazard indices have been also determined. The maximum value for the radium equivalent activity, 206.35 Bq kg-1, was found in soil, but it is less than the permitted value of 370 Bq Kg-1. All the materials have values for both external and internal hazard indices of < 1.

AB Proximate answers to questions about species longevity are to be found in the physiological processes that regulate duration of life, But what are these processes, and how are they themselves controlled? This leads to ultimate, evolutionary questions about longevity. What are the selection forces that favor one life span instead of another for a given species? To understand the evolution of life span we need also to understand the evolution of aging. A plausible hypothesis is that because of the requirement for reproduction, natural selection favors a strategy that invests fewer resources in maintenance of somatic cells and tissues than are necessary for indefinite survival. This "disposable soma" theory predicts that aging is due to the accumulation of unrepaired somatic defects and the primary genetic control of longevity operates through selection to raise or lower the investment in basic cellular maintenance systems in relation to the level of environmental hazard.

AB Earthquake insurance can reduce potentially disastrous economic losses to households and is therefore a prime method of mitigating against the worst economic effects of damaging earthquakes. The decision to purchase such insurance is a special case in the general study of individual response to uncertainty in the environment. An understanding of this decision process elucidates the ways in which environmental information becomes translated into behavior change. Although California legislation has mandated the disclosure of the availability of earthquake insurance to all residential property owners since 1984, less than half of California homeowners have earthquake insurance. This paper reports on the results of a survey of 3,500 owner-occupiers in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino Counties conducted in the summer of 1989. The survey was undertaken to discover the locational concentrations of insurance policy-holders and the socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal characteristics that distinguish insured from noninsured homeowners. The results show that insurance purchase is not spatially related to geophysical risk and that the purchase of insurance is not systematically related to income, equity in the home, age of the head of household, or other socioeconomic characteristics. Instead, perceived risk is the primary factor associated with insurance purchase.

TI HAZARD MANAGEMENT IN BRITAIN - ANOTHER DISASTROUS DECADE
SO AREA
LA English
DT Article
AB The 1980s produced no shortage of serious natural, technological, social and transportation emergencies in Britain.  These challenged the widely held view that Britain is not a hazardous place in which to live, and led to critical examination of the arrangements for hazard and emergency planning.  However, a range of institutional and other factors suggest that lessons have not been learnt, and that Britain may be heading for another disastrous decade-paradoxically the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.

AB This article examines the public's responses to newspaper and television reports of an impending natural hazard that threatened local water supplies.  A conceptual model is developed in which we argue that distinct characteristics of the two media differentially affect response behavior.  The results provide strong support for the hypotheses derived from the conceptual model, suggesting that different aspects of reports in the two media affect response behavior, as measured by wholesale sales of bottled water.

TI THE USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CANADA FORESTED LANDS
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Present uses of prescribed fire in Canada are reviewed. Fire has been a natural component of many forested North American landscapes for millennia, making it an obvious choice as an effective forest management tool. It can be used in harmony with known fire adaptations of ecosystems to be managed. Prescribed fire uses are separated into six categories: (1) hazard reduction which evolved into (2) silviculture (including fire use for site preparation, managing competing vegetation, stand conversion, and stand rehabilitation) (3) wildlife habitat enhancement (4) range burning (5) insect and disease control (6) conservation of natural ecosystems. Some historic developments of prescribed fire use are presented including area burned under prescription by province and territory. Prescribed fire emerges as a cost effective practice that is ecologically compatible with many forest, wildlife, and park management objectives. Its continued use in the management of Canadian forests seems to be assured, as long as it is constantly developed and adapted to the changing needs and priorities of the general public.

TI SEA CLIFF RETREAT IN SOUTHERN PORTUGAL - PROFILES, PROCESSES, AND
   PROBLEMS
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE CLIFF RETREAT; COASTAL EROSION; HAZARD MITIGATION; PORTUGAL (ALGARVE)
AB Southern Portugal's central Algarve coast is undergoing accelerated cliff retreat due to the combined effects of sea-level rise and natural and anthropogenic erosion. Between Olhos de Agua and Quinta do Lago, 10 to 50 m high red cliffs are cut into friable Miocene to Quaternary clastics. This area can be divided into three distinct zones based on natural cliff evolution and human influence. The western zone (Praia de Falesia) is characterized by continuous cliffs, 15 to 45 m high, dominated by natural erosive processes and has retreat rates on the order of 1 m/year. The middle zone cliffs (Forte Novo-Vale do Lobo) are 10 to 20 m in height, interrupted by stream mouths, and subject to retreat rates of more than 2 m/year. Human activities have caused changes, including development of the cliff upland and modification of nearby shorelines, such as at Quarteira. Locally, as much as 6.3 m of retreat have occurred in a single yew. The eastern zone cliffs (Quinta do Lago) me now inactive due to the formation of a protective barrier system. The cliffed zones provide a case study for contrasting the impact of shoreline protective structures and the different styles of upland development relative to the proximity of the cliff edge.
   Evolution of the cliff profiles shows a repetitive pattern controlled by the dominance of either marine or subaerial erosion processes, including such factors as wave conditions, storm frequency, tidal range, runoff, joint systems, lithologic heterogeneity, cliff-face position of harder and softer layers, clay content, water-rich layers, vegetation, occurrence of earthquakes, and human influences within the area (e.g., updrift jetties, groins, seawalls, digging caves, construction, vibration, and adding water). Future solutions to problems associated with cliff retreat should be based on known retreat rates, the projected wa-level rise, and the past experience of human impact on the cliffs.

DE BUILDINGS; ENGINEERING DESIGN; LANDFILL GAS; PROTECTION MEASURES
AB This paper outlines the engineering design philosophy for development sites affected by landfill gas. The hazards of landfill gas need to be fully understood and evaluated in relation to the location and type of building structure proposed, and a comprehensive assessment and design process should be undertaken. This involves interpretation of investigation and monitoring data, prediction of future trends, selection of appropriate design parameters, evaluation of gas-control measures, safety during construction, and long-term serviceability and monitoring.
   A description is given of the principal types of gas control measures which allow building development to take place on sites affected by landfill gas, and guidance is provided for the design of such measures. These measures include site encapsulation, gas-venting trenches and wells, gas-resistant membranes and barriers, natural ventilation to structures, and gas-detection and management systems.

TI INFLUENCE OF A POLYACRYLAMIDE SOIL CONDITIONER ON RUNOFF GENERATION AND
   SOIL-EROSION - FIELD-TESTS IN BARINGO DISTRICT, KENYA
SO SOIL TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Following promising laboratory results the effect of low concentration applications of a polyacrylamide soil conditioner SEPARAN AP30 on soil properties was tested under field conditions in a severely degraded semi-arid region in northern Kenya.  Tests of conditioner performance on tilled and undisturbed soils were carried out under simulated rainfall on crusting Eutric or Calcaric Fluvisols at two sites on alluvio-lacustrine flats adjacent to Lake Baringo. Tests were carried out in two series separated by up to six weeks of sunshine and natural rainfall, to determine the longevity and residual effects of conditioner application.
   Runoff generation and soil loss were significantly reduced on all runoff plots during the first rainfall simulation, but the most dramatic results occurred when conditioner application was combined with raking. This inhibited crust development and virtually eliminated runoff and soil loss, Under natural weathering, surface crusts had developed on all plots before the second rainfall simulations. Some residual effects of the conditioner on infiltration rates were still noted, but the residual effect on soil loss was greatly diminished.
   The tests indicate that low concentration applications of SEPARAN are not useful on undisturbed soils, but can provide useful temporary reductions in sheet and rillwash hazard when combined with tillage and could be effectively combined with grass re-seeding for more permanent reclamation.

   EXPOSURES; NATURAL-HISTORY; HOMOSEXUAL MEN
AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occupational risk from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in terms of loss of (quality-adjusted) life expectancy, and to compare that risk to those posed by other hazards faced by health care workers.
   DESIGN: Decision-analytic model.
   RESULTS: For a 30-year-old female health care worker (unvaccinated for hepatitis B virus [HBV]), the loss of life expectancy from a needlestick from a symptomatic HIV-positive (HIV+) patient is 39 days (range, 17 to 93 days), as compared with a loss of 17 days from a needlestick from a patient who is hepatitis-B-surface-antigen-positive (HBsAg+), and 38 days from a needlestick from a patient who is hepatitis-B-e-antigen-positive (HBeAg+). When morbidity is included in the analysis of risk (through calculation of the quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy), the risk from both HBV and HIV increases. The quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy due to a needlestick exposure from a symptomatic HIV+ patient is 45 days (range, 20 to 108 days), as compared with a quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy of 48 days from a needlestick from an HBsAg+ patient, and 109 days from a needlestick from a patient who is known to be HBeAg+. By comparison, a cross-country automobile trip is associated with a loss of life expectancy of approximately 1 day. The 45- to 50-day loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy from percutaneous exposures to HIV and HBV is approximately the same magnitude as the gain in life expectancy from 10 years of annual screening for breast cancer with mammography and physical examination.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk associated with percutaneous exposures to symptomatic HIV+ patients is comparable to other risks that health care workers have faced knowingly and have accepted in the recent past. However, the loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with a needlestick exposure is significant. Identification of cost-effective methods that increase the safety of medical personnel but also ensure full access to high-quality care for HIV+ patients should be a high priority.

AB Aquatic microbial communities contain many species performing several critical functions in aquatic ecosystems and, thus, may provide robust indicators of stress. Effects of the cationic surfactant dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (C12-TMAC) on benthic microbial communities in experimental stream channels were assessed. Tests were performed with microbial communities: (1) developed in the stream channels for 14 days prior to exposure; (2) developed in the presence of the chemical; (3) developed in the relatively unimpacted headwaters of the stream providing water to the facility for 16 days prior to exposure. Gross indicators of community structure, such as the taxon richness and composition of the protozoan and diatom assemblages tended to be unaffected by the chemical. Effects on growth processes and trophic relationships were generally transitory and occurred at moderate concentrations (250-mu-g/l) of cationic surfactant. Most sensitive single species responses to this chemical in previous laboratory tests were more sensitive than overall community responses examined here and elsewhere. However, broad assessments of fisk using these communities allow for: (1) validation of single species responses, and (2) predictions of potential long-term effects on natural ecosystems unavailable from single species tests. This should allow for increased accuracy in risk assessments.

AB Research on the acute and chronic effects of victimization by disaster has found that some patterns of response generalize across disasters of different origin and type. However, it is likely that variation in the nature of the victimizing event can affect long-term psychophysiological reactions. This study compared 23 flood victims with 27 people living near a leaking hazardous toxic waste dump and 27 control subjects. Self-report, behavioral, and physiological measures of stress were collected, all of which showed that 9 months after the announcement of the toxic hazard and the destructive flood, subjects living near the waste dump were more anxious, depressed, and alienated, less able to perform challenging tasks, and more aroused than were flood victims or control subjects. Residents of the landfill neighborhood also reported more feelings of helplessness than did any other subjects, and these feelings were significantly correlated with stress. Victimization associated with the toxic landfill appeared more likely to pose threats to victims' sense of control and to cause chronic emotional and psychophysiological problems than did the natural disaster.

DT Article
DE VOLCANOS; BARREN-ISLAND; ANDAMAN SEA; NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Geotectonically the Barren and Narcondum islands lie on the Neogene Inner volcanic arc, which proceeds from the recent volcanoes of Central Burma in the North to the Miocene to Recent volcanoes of Indonesia in the SE and are believed to have evolved as a result of eastward subduction of the Indian Ocean lithosphere below the SE Asian plate. The Barren island volcano is characterised by resurgent volcanism; so far, three distinct volcanic episodes have been recorded. An initially submarine volcanism, possibly taking place in late to Post-Pleistocene time formed a giant volcanic cone representing the ancestral Barren island. This ancient volcanic cone was at times, blown out and a thick pile of pyroclastics got deposited over the surface of the relict cauldron. Historical records reveal that the volcano became active again in 1789 when the existing cone with a crater and three subsidiary vents were developed. The present eruption initially starting from the NE subsidiary vent, subsequently merged with the main crater. The intensity of volcanic eruption gradually gathered momentum and continued unabated with thundering explosions till the end of September, 1991. Since November it is lying dormant. There is no major disastrous effect.
   The lava of the first phase was olivine basalt and that of the second phase a high-alumina olivine basalt.

AB Environmental health concerns in the Persian Gulf are peculiar to the geography of the region. Prevention of heat and solar injury deserves primary consideration, but cold injury also may occur in the desert. Immunizations are recommended against a number of diseases, while malarial chemoprophylaxis is necessary in Iraq and Kuwait. In addition to malaria, other parasitic diseases deserve consideration. Diarrheal diseases, diseases from the desert dust, and products of infected desert animals are of concern. Additional natural hazards are venomous bites from scorpions and desert snakes. Finally, threats of enemy action necessitated protection from nuclear biological and chemical weapons and LASER eye/skin injury. Unexploded ordinance will constitute a continuing hazard into the future.

AB The application of the hedonic pricing technique to estimating consumer values of avoiding or incurring the risk of loss from natural hazards has recently appeared in the literature (e.g., Brookshire et al. 1985; MacDonald, Murdoch, and White 1987). The probabilistic nature of the hazards evaluated in these studies raise new questions regarding the interpretation of the hedonic prices estimated. We present a hedonic price model that accounts for information level and uncertainty when valuing non market goods. A simple set of rules are derived for analyzing hedonic prices for probabilistic nonmarket goods.

TI THE CONSEQUENCES OF WATER INGRESS INTO THE PRIMARY CIRCUIT OF AN

AB The ingress of large amounts of water into the primary circuit of an HTR-Module represents the most severe hazard potential of that reactor plant. Nevertheless, the consequences of these accidents are shown to be practically negligible for the design basis accident and are still tolerable even for extreme hypothetical postulates. This benign behavior of the HTR-Module is due to many inherent properties which are especially designed into the nuclear steam supply system and will be explained in the paper. The core response due to the ingress of neutron moderating steam is discussed in detail and the consequences of the production of inflammable water gas by the chemical reaction of graphite and steam are shown. Concerning the environmental radiation hazard of the worst, still plausible hypothetical accident it is claimed that the radiation dose will not exceed the natural radiation dose accumulated over 50 years by more than an order of magnitude.

AB Heavy precipitation is one of the most significant natural hazards in the United States today. Knowledge of the climatography, including the temporal characteristics, of this phenomenon is necessary in order to better plan, design for, and predict this hazard. In this study, cluster analysis is used to simplify and clarify the spatial patterns in the time of day heavy precipitation most frequently occurs. Regions with similar diurnal properties are delineated, and the substantial seasonal fluctuations in the regional patterns are traced. Of particular interest is the expansion during the cool season and contraction during the warm season of the nocturnal precipitation regime in the central United States.

ID CALIFORNIA; MODEL
AB This paper continues the work by Molchan (1990, 1991b), who has considered earthquake prediction as a problem of the optimization of a certain loss function gamma.  Function-gamma is defined by specific social, economic, and geophysical goals.  This problem can be fully solved for the loss function-gamma dependent on only two parameters:  fraction of alarm time, tau, and fraction of failures to predict, nu.  For such a loss function the tasks of geophysicists and decision makers are clearly defined and can be separated; the requirements of the prediction algorithm can be completely formulated in terms of hazard function.  We also consider a more complex model of the loss function, introducing a finite number of various alarms.  For each of these alarms, gamma depends on three parameters; in addition to tau and nu, we take into account the total number of alarms, lambda.  For this model we find strategies which optimize the losses for each time unit (locally optimal).  Contrary to the simple case of gamma(tau,nu), such strategies may not be optimal globally (for the entire time interval).  We determine the conditions under which the locally optimal strategy becomes globally optimal.  We illustrate our results using the model of a short-term earthquake prediction for central California.  We emphasize that for this complex case, the tasks of geophysicists and decision makers in prediction are intertwined.  Prediction and mitigation of many other natural disasters may benefit from the alert strategies discussed here.

AB The relevance of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) concentration to the development of early clinical manifestations of homozygous sickle (SS) disease has been investigated by examining the time to first occurrence and the proportional hazard of these complications in three groups of the HbF distribution at age 5 years. HbF was significantly related to dactylitis, painful crises, acute chest syndrome, and acute splenic sequestration. The relationship suggested that a critically low HbF concentration increased the risk, little difference in risk occurring between the medium and high HbF groups. The abdominal painful crisis and hypersplenism were not related to HbF concentration suggesting that the degree of sickling may not be important in their genesis. Parental education on acute splenic sequestration should be focused on children with HbF concentrations in the lowest part of the HbF distribution for age.

AB Since the application of isoenzyme electrophoresis to the study of Entamoeba histolytica, the prevalence and natural history of asymptomatic intestinal colonization in patients with amebic liver abscess (ALA) has not been addressed.  We prospectively evaluated this enteric phase in 50 patients with ALA, using two dosage regimens of metronidazole.  The overall prevalence of asymptomatic colonization was 72% (36/50).  All these isolates, without exception, proved to express pathogenic zymodemes.  Despite a 100% clinical response of the hepatic lesions, failure to eradicate the organism from the bowel occurred in 20 of these 36 subjects.  During longitudinal posttreatment surveillance, three carriers returned with second bouts of invasive disease:  one with dysentery and two with liver abscesses.  Thus, in patients with ALA, there is a high prevalence of intestinal colonization with exclusively pathogenic strains, and treatment with metronidazole frequently results in a continued carrier state.  These carriers have a propensity for developing recurrent invasive disease and constitute a public health hazard.

AB The choice of an appropriate and safe disposal alternative should be based on the wide range of physicochemical examination thermal analysis in conjunction with other data enables identification of wastes, allows determination of weight losses at any stage of thermal decomposition and characterization of the combustible properties of wastes.
   In this paper the physicochemical composition of some industrial wastes, which create serious hazards to the natural environment is presented.
   The following waste materials were investigated: - tar wastes from several departments of the coking plant - paint-shop wastes from a metallurgical factory.
   Thermoanalytic measurements were carried out in the dynamic atmosphere of air. Enthalpic values were calculated from the peak areas of the DTA curves.
   Thermoanalytic data were compared with calorimetric results obtained from an oxygen bomb.                                             The disposal methods for above-mentioned wastes are proposed.

TI AGROECOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
AB Most agricultural regions of California enjoy long growing seasons, fertile soils and irrigation, all conditions that favor a highly diversified cropping. In addition. the wide variety of vegetables, field and tree crops determine a high diversity and flexibility of agricultural enterprises, Despite these factors, Californian agroecosystems are dominated by monocultural cropping systems. Although productive, these systems lack the ecological features to ensure efficient nutrient cycling, water and soil conservation, and biotic regulation. Productivity is subsidized with chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers, some of which cause undesirable environmental and public health hazards. Large-scale monocultures are also highly susceptible to wind erosion and are dependent on ground water for irrigation, leading in some areas to a considerable 'overdraft'. In other regions, poor field drainage and rising water tables are leading to unacceptable soil salinity levels. In summary, Californian agriculture is very productive, but the environmental cost of such productivity is threatening the sustainability of agriculture.
   The search for self-sustaining, low-input, diversified and energy-efficient agricultural systems is now a major concern of researchers, farmers, policy makers and the public in California. The long tradition in biological pest control in California, as well as the experience of a number of organic farmers who developed low-input systems through 'trial and error', provide the building blocks for the search for a more sustainable agriculture.
   A key strategy in sustainable agriculture is to restore the agricultural diversity of the agricultural landscape. Diversity can be enhanced in time through crop rotations and sequences, and in space in the form of cover crops, intercropping, agroforestry crop/livestock mixtures, etc. Vegetation diversification not only results in pest regulation through restoration of natural controls, but also produces optimal nutrient recycling, energy conservation and less dependence on cultural inputs. In California, although this new approach to agriculture is actively researched, realistically it will work only if it is economically sensible and can be carried out within the constraints of a fairly normal agricultural system. Therefore, adoption of recommended diversification designs will proceed as these reduce costs and increase the efficiency and viability of farmers.

AB The idea of the fourth age of life is introduced as a worldwide challenge and a society-wide revolution.  Longevity is newly defined as the significant extension of peoples' lives beyond what was normally happening in earlier historical areas.  What it does not mean is more opportunity to retire from life into active ill health, or adding years to life in exchange for less health.  Attention is drawn to the rise of four-generation nations in which traditional family patterns are also changing.  Discussion focuses on how the fourth age is inventing a new history of society where people transcend the chronological discontinuities imposed on their lives by governmental and conventional age-controlled periods of productivity and nonproductivity.  This new history is one in which more of the elderly population join the work force with their reserve capacity of motivation and energy.  Women's numerical preponderance in the fourth age and their changing world view about who they are and what they can do are also seen as having a special impact on the graying of society.  These changes include an altered and firmer attitude toward self, and overcoming the stereotypes of the woman as the natural caregiver and supporter of the ill and the elderly.  Overall, the fourth age people are beginning to see self-empowerment as a necessity for survival, and the younger generations are noticing the older person as a 'survivor' rather than a 'victim' of the hazards of living.  This, in turn, is seen as an opportunity for old and young alike to explore, innovate, and prevail.

AB Objective:  To better characterize the natural history of disease due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in African women.
   Design:  Prospective cohort study over a 2-year follow-up period.
   Participants:  A total of 460 HIV-seropositive women and a comparison cohort of HIV-seronegative women recruited from prenatal and pediatric clinics in Kigali, Rwanda in 1988.
   Measurements:  Clinical signs and symptoms of HIV disease, AIDS, and mortality.
   Main Results:  Follow-up data at 2 years were available for 93% of women who were still alive.  At enrollment, many seropositive women reported symptoms listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition of AIDS, but these were nonspecific and often improved over time.  The 2-year mortality among HIV-infected women by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was 7% (95% Cl, 5% to 10%) overall, and 21% (Cl, 8% to 34%) for the 40 women who fulfilled the WHO case definition of AIDS at entry.  In comparison, the 2-year mortality in women not infected with HIV was only 0.3% (Cl, 0% to 7%).  Independent baseline predictors of mortality in seropositive women by Cox proportional hazards modeling were, in order of descending risk factor prevalence:  a body mass index of 21 kg/m2 or less (relative hazard, 2.3; Cl, 1.1 to 4.8), low income (relative hazard, 2.3; Cl, 1.1 to 4.5), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate exceeding 60 mm/h (relative hazard, 4.9; Cl, 2.2 to 10.9), chronic diarrhea (relative hazard, 2.6; Cl, 1.1 to 5.7), a history of herpes zoster (relative hazard 5.3; Cl, 2.5 to 11.4), and oral candida (relative hazard, 7.3; Cl, 1.6 to 33.3).  Human immunodeficiency virus disease was the cause of death in 38 of the 39 HIV-positive women who died, but only 25 met the WHO definition of AIDS before death.
   Conclusions:  Human immunodeficiency virus disease now accounts for 90% of all deaths among child-bearing urban Rwandan women.  Many symptomatic seropositive patients may show some clinical improvement and should not be denied routine medical care.  Easily diagnosed signs and symptoms and inexpensive laboratory tests can be used in Africa to identify those patients with a particularly good or bad prognosis.

TI INTRAVASCULAR OXYGENATOR - A NEW ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR AUGMENTING
   BLOOD-GAS TRANSFER IN PATIENTS WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY-FAILURE
SO ARTIFICIAL ORGANS
LA English
DT Article
AB A unique hollow fiber membrane oxygenator (IVOX) has been developed, which is inserted into the vena caval blood stream to transfer O2/CO2 to/from circulating blood in an intact subject without involving the natural lungs.  Extensive laboratory testing has demonstrated that the device can transfer significant quantities of O2 and CO2 for up to 3 weeks without significant harmful sequelae or complications.  Clinical trials are in progress under FDA supervision, in which IVOX has been utilized to date in 56 patients with ARDS.  Preliminary findings indicate that risks and hazards from IVOX are nil, and evidence of benefit to the patient has been demonstrated in 86% of the patients.  At this time, clinical utilization of IVOX is in the experimental, data collecting mode to determine its proper role or niche as a method for temporary augmentation of blood gas transfer in patients with advanced acute respiratory failure.

TI RESISTANCE, TOLERANCE, AND YIELD OF WESTERN BLACK COTTONWOOD INFECTED BY
   MELAMPSORA RUST
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE
   FORESTIERE
LA English
DT Article
AB Potted ramets of 14 western black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) clones from southern British Columbia were inoculated with Melampsora occidentalis H. Jacks. to produce a range of disease severities, and their size and dry weight were determined after 1 or 2 years.  Response to inoculation varied significantly between clones.  Clones from drier interior locations were less resistant than those from coastal or moister interior locations.  Local- (within leaf) or systemic-induced resistance was not detected.  Yield (total dry weight) decreased linearly with disease severity.  Percent reduction in yield was greater than the cumulative percent leaf area infected for all clones.  Yield losses were substantial:  dry weights of ramets with disease severity levels similar to those experienced by natural cottonwood populations were about 75% of controls; heavily infected ramets were < 50% of controls.  Stem:root ratios increased rapidly with increasing disease severity in all clones, and at significantly different rates.  Severe infection resulted in substantial mortality in the following winter and reduced initial stem volume growth in the following growing season.  Tolerance, defined as the relationship between disease severity and yield, varied significantly between clones.  The most significant discovery of this study was that tolerance and resistance were correlated, greater tolerance being associated with reduced resistance.  The concepts of resistance, tolerance, and disease hazard, as quantified in this study, can be used to predict yield and to select the most appropriate clones for different disease hazard conditions.

TI ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE AND CONSUMPTION OF HYDROGENATED MARINE OILS IN
   ENGLAND AND WALES
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID FATTY-ACIDS; ADIPOSE-TISSUE
AB Study objective - The aim was to examine the hypothesis that hydrogenated fats, particularly those obtained from marine oils, may present a health hazard.
   Design - Storage fat specimens obtained at necropsy were collected from several areas in England and Wales during 1975-1978. Cases (n = 136 samples) consisted of males dying of ischaemic heart disease, male deaths from unrelated causes acting as controls (n = 95 samples). The fatty acid compositions of the specimens were determined, and analysis included those acids-16:1 trans and "higher" C-20 plus C-22 (H)-highly characteristic of partially hydrogenated marine oils.
   Measurements and main results - The case samples, which had been shown to be the richer in 16:1 trans (p < 0.005), were now found to have a significantly higher value of the ratio 16:1 trans to H (p < 0.002), arising from consumption of differing hydrogenated marine oil types.
   Conclusions - It is concluded that the cases had consumed a greater amount (p < 0.001) of hydrogenated marine oils of a certain type, ie, that manufactured from certain highly unsaturated raw oils. The process of partial hydrogenation results in conversion to a product containing large amounts of polyunsaturated acids (PUFA) which are no longer in the natural all-cis methylene interrupted configuration. Such isomeric PUFA may obstruct or compete with utilisation of natural PUFA. It is further concluded that the case excess did not rise from medical advice favouring margarine or from any difference in social class status, but rather from fortuitous selection of margarine brand.

AB The earthquakes constitute a rapid onset, natural hazard that poses a serious threat of catastrophic disaster in certain parts of India.  This paper surveys the inputs required for preparing a well-estimated map of hazard for the country.  The rationale for improving the above estimation by the identification of earthquake source processes and areas of high seismic potential are discussed.  These include the concept of asperities and barriers, the velocity structure, the nature of rupture process, the geothermal status and the rate of plate convergence.  The gaps in the existing knowledge base are identified and mechanisms to generate the missing knowledge, are suggested.  The notions of vulnerability and risk posed by earthquakes are presented.

AB An earthquake is one of the worst of natural calamities.  Internationally, serious and scientifically acceptable earthquake prediction studies started only about three decades ago.  'Short Term' prediction of the Heicheng earthquake of February 4, 1975 in China is a land mark.  No acceptable short term predictions have yet been made in India.  A medium term prediction made for a major earthquake in the vicinity of Indo-Burma border region in 1986 has come true.  A number of studies, relevant to earthquake precursors have been reported by Indian scientists which are reviewed in this paper.  Prediction of possible earthquake hazards and suggesting ways and means to mitigate the same, particularly in the Indian part of the Alpide seismic belt, is an important area which deserves special attention.

TI BAYESIAN SUBSET ANALYSIS IN A COLORECTAL-CANCER CLINICAL-TRIAL
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Subset analysis is the examination of treatment comparisons within groups of patients with restricted levels of patient characteristics. Such analyses are vulnerable to multiplicity effects. We examine the problem in the context of a proportional hazards model with terms for treatment, each of several dichotomous covariates representing the patient characteristics of interest, and treatment-by-covariate interaction effects. Parametrically, a subset-specific treatment effect is equal to the treatment effect term plus a linear combination of the interaction terms. We present Bayesian point and interval estimates under the assumption that the interaction terms are exchangeable and the prior distributions for the other regression parameters are locally uniform. This produces a shrinking of the estimated interaction effects towards zero, thereby discounting them and dealing in a natural way with multiplicity. We illustrate the method using results of a recent North Central Cancer Treatment Group/Mayo Clinic study in advanced colorectal cancer.

ID UNRUPTURED ANEURYSMS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT
AB There is still a relative silence in the literature on what policy should be followed in treating multiple aneurysms. The main risks are: bleeding of a formerly asymptomatic aneurysm during the haemodynamic tides of the peri-operative period; aneurysm(s) can be hidden on angiograms and tend to be overlooked easier in case of an already revealed aneursym; misjudgement of the ruptured one as a silent additional aneurysm, therefore left for second stage surgery.
   This paper, based on a material of 330 operations for multiple aneurysms, focuses on these problems. It advocates the one stage complete repair of all lesions using both options of bilateral pterional craniotomies or the contralateral approach. But it also describes those silent aneurysms which safely could be clipped later. Hazards and disadvantages concerning the more aggressive surgery proved to be less significant than the natural history of multiple aneurysms represents.

TI CHEMICAL SPECIATION OF NICKEL IN AIRBORNE DUSTS - ANALYTICAL METHOD AND
   RESULTS OF AN INTERLABORATORY TEST PROGRAM
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID MORTALITY; WORKERS; CANCER
AB Analytical knowledge, qualitative and quantitative, of the various nickel species present in the airborne dusts of nickel-producing and nickel-using workplaces is required for the assessment of nickel-related health hazards.  A wet-chemical procedure is described which apportions the airborne nickel species into four categories:  water soluble, "sulfidic", metallic, and "oxidic".  The sample is leached in a sequence with ammonium citrate, hydrogen peroxide-ammonium citrate, and bromine-methanol, each of which selectively dissolves a number of related nickel species.  Each leach solution and the insoluble residue from the third leach are then analyzed for nickel.  The underlying chemistry of each leaching step is discussed, and its selectivity and completeness is evaluated.  Since real workplace samples usually contain a limited number of species which are linked to the feeds and processes used and the final products, this 4-fold categorization is generally adequate to speciate the sample.  The suitability of various filter materials for sampling airborne dusts for the purpose of speciation is examined.  Problems caused by natural alkalinity of glass fiber filters are discussed.  The results of an international interlaboratory test program of this nickel speciation method are reported.

AB Field tests with natural ponds often lack sufficient replication and/or control, making interpretation and evaluation of results difficult.  For the assessment of potential hazards of chemicals to aquatic ecosystems, small artificial ponds have become increasingly valuable.  Artificial pond ecosystems should, as far as possible, reflect natural conditions, contain all trophic levels with a high diversity of organisms, and, most importantly, be logistically and experimentally manageable.  To fulfill these conditions, 5-m3-volume ponds, interconnected by closable locks, were provided with natural lake sediment and well water.  Caged fish were added to each pond, and the interconnecting locks were kept open until identical physicochemical and biological conditions had been established.  At this time, the ponds were isolated from one another and experiments with a pyrethroid insecticide (Baythroid(R)) containing cyfluthrin as the active ingredient (a.i.) were conducted.  The results of these field tests, which include both the fate and the biological effects of the insecticide, were compared with data obtained in larger natural ponds.  Overall, the results were similar, indicating that useful information on the potential hazard of chemicals can be obtained in small artificial ponds.

AB We performed a 3-armed phase III study between 1982 and 1990 to evaluate low dose natural interferon alfa (nIFN-alpha) as a maintenance therapy in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) following induction chemotherapy (CT) and consolidation radiotherapy (RT).  All patients received four cycles of CT (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide), followed by split-course RT (55 Gy in 20 fractions over 7 weeks).  410 patients entered the study.  237 patients who completed induction CT + RT and were classified as responders (complete response + partial response) were randomly assigned to arm 1:  low dose nIFN-alpha (91 patients); arm 2:  maintenance CT, six cycles of CAP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin) (59 patients); or arm 3:  control arm (no maintenance treatment) (87 patients).  Halfway through the study the CAP arm was discontinued.  There was no difference in median survival between the groups (IFN:11 months, CAP:11 months, control:10 months), but a clear difference in long-term survival and in survival in the limited disease group, favouring nIFN-alpha maintenance therapy.  Proportional hazards regression analysis also showed a significant effect of IFN treatment on survival.  Our results suggest a role for nIFN-alpha in maintaining a clinically disease-free status achieved with other treatment modalities.

TI THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL-USE ON REBLEEDING AND MORTALITY IN PATIENTS WITH

AB The effect of continued alcohol intake on prognosis in alcoholic cirrhotics who have already bled from varices is controversial. To investigate the effect of alcohol intake on prognosis we studied 189 consecutive alcoholic cirrhotics admitted, for the first time, to the Royal Free Hospital with variceal bleeding. Sixty-six died within 30 days of admission and 23 were excluded from the study for other reasons. Of the 100 remaining 15 remained 'probably abstinent' over long-term follow-up, 29 drank occasionally and 56 continued to misuse/abuse alcohol. The percentage survival probability at 2 years was 66% in the probable abstainers, 68% in the occasional drinkers and 63% in the alcohol abuse/misuse group. There were no significant differences in either mortality or rebleeding rates between the three groups. A rebleeding index (designed to take account of the number of rebleeds per patient and the total length of follow-up) also failed to show any significant difference between the three groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to study the effect of the following factors on rebleeding and mortality; age, sex, alcohol use, Pugh's score, acute treatment received for initial variceal bleed and long-term treatment received for prevention of recurrent variceal haemorrhage. Pugh's score was significantly related to risk of death during follow-up (p = 0.0122), but none of the other factors was significantly related to risk of rebleeding or mortality. Using conventional methods to determine alcohol use we were unable to demonstrate significant effects of alcohol intake on rebleeding or mortality in alcoholic cirrhotics who had bled from oesophageal varices.

AB The association between the decay rating for specimen condition and the depth of soft and white rot was examined, for the hardwood population remaining in a natural durability test at four sites after 15, 19 and 21 years' exposure. Evidence is presented that, for the two sites where the decay hazard is far more severe than the termite hazard (Brisbane and Pennant Hills), the presence of deep white rot in the absence of soft rot played an important part in specimens becoming unserviceable at these times. For all sites, the largest population of specimens in the better condition had soft rot present in shallow or deep form while white rot was absent. The Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to study the association between paired variables comprising depth of soft rot, depth of white rot, decay rating and termite rating. The increasing depth of white rot was significantly related to reduction in specimen condition (decay rating) at all times at Innisfail, Brisbane and Pennant Hills. There was also a highly significant negative correlation between the depth of white rot and the depth of soft rot at the latter two sites.

AB The intrinsic toxicity of deltamethrin to the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (F.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and a range of its important natural enemies was determined by laboratory topical bioassay. The natural enemies included polyphagous predators such as Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Harpalus rufipes (Degeer), Nebria brevicollis (F.), Agonum dorsale (Pont.), Demetrias atricapillus (L.), Trechus quadristriatus (Schrank), Bembidion obtusum (Serville), and B. lampros (Herbst.) (Coleoptera: Carabidae), Tachyporus hypnorum (F.) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and Erigone atra (Blackwall) (Araneae: Linyphiidae), as well as the aphid-specific ladybird Coccinella septempunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). Dose-response relationships were compared between species by probit analysis and maximum likelihood procedures to determine trends of susceptibility, measured in terms of ng a.i. arthropod-1 and mug a.i. g-1 body weight. The range of LD50 values varied between 0.8 and 232 ng arthropod-1 and 0.76 and 66.17 mug g-1 body weight for the species tested. The linyphiid spider E. atra (female) was the most intrinsically susceptible species and had the narrowest tolerance distribution of the predators tested, whereas the small carabid beetle D. atricapillus was the least intrinsically susceptible predator species. There were significant differences in susceptibility between species of different orders, i.e. the Araneae, Hemiptera and Coleoptera. Differences within the Coleoptera were closely related to body weight, with the exception of the carabid beetle D. atricapillus, which seemed to be tolerant to deltamethrin. Knockdown time studies indicated that D. atricapillus had a higher survival rate after being knocked down than other species of predator. Aphid susceptibility per unit body weight was not significantly different from that of the predators. The aphid did, however, demonstrate a broader tolerance distribution than most of the predators, which may be related to its herbivorous nature. The use of laboratory susceptibility data to determine selectivity and to predict pesticide hazard is discussed.

TI MECHANICS OF SEISMIC INSTABILITIES INDUCED BY THE RECOVERY OF
   HYDROCARBONS
SO PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS

CT WORKSHOP ON INDUCED SEISMICITY, AS PART OF THE 33RD US ROCK MECHANICS

AB We review earthquake distributions associated with hydrocarbon fields in the context of pore pressure diffusion models, poroelastic stress transfer and isostasy theory. These three mechanisms trigger or induce seismic instabilities at both local scale (D less-than-or-equal-to 5 km) and at regional scale (D greater-than-or-equal-to 20 km). The modeled changes in stress are small (less-than-or-equal-to 1 MPa), whatever the tectonic setting. Each mechanism corresponds to different production processes. ( 1) Local hydraulic fracturing due to fluid injection induces seismic-slip on cracks (M(L) less-than-or-equal-to 3) within the injected reservoir through decreasing the effective stress. (2) Pure fluid withdrawal causes pore pressure to decrease within the reservoir. It triggers adjustments of the geological structure to perturbations related to the reservoir response to depletion. Poroelastic mechanisms transfer this stress change from the reservoir to the surrounding levels where M(L) less-than-or-equal-to 5 seismic instabilities occur either above or below the reservoir. (3) Massive hydrocarbon recovery induces crustal readjustments due to the removal of load from the upper crust. It can induce larger earthquakes (M(L) greater-than-or-equal-to 6) at greater distance from the hydrocarbon fields than the two other mechanisms.
   Due to the mechanical properties of the shallow rock matrices involved, seismic slip triggered either by mechanism (1) or (2), is a second-order process of the main elastoplastic deformation. For a minimum of 80% of commercially productive basins, most of the local deformation is reported as aseismic, i.e., there is no evidence for M(L) greater-than-or-equal-to 3 earthquakes. Nevertheless, the induced stresses vary as a function of time in a manner that depends on the hydraulic diffusivity (i.e., permeability) of the reservoir and surrounding rocks. Because small earthquakes (M(L) less-than-or-equal-to 3) indicate changes in stress and pore pressure, monitoring of seismicity is a means of assessing in situ reservoir behavior.
   The less constrained seismic response to hydrocarbon recovery is the possible connection between local fluid manipulations, triggered earthquakes and major regional earthquakes. Positive feedback mechanisms suggest that the region of seismic hazard changes is much larger than the area where hydrocarbons are extracted. These observations and models testify that fluid movement and pore pressure changes (increase or decrease) play important roles in the mechanics of earthquakes and in the triggering of natural earthquakes.

AB The Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) is an easily accessible, standardized resource of positive and negative long-term animal cancer tests. The CPDB has been published in four earlier papers that include results for approximately 4000 experiments on 1050 chemicals. This paper describes the CPDB: goals, inclusion criteria, fields of information, and published plot format. It also presents an overview of our published papers using the CPDB. The CPDB as published in plot format readily permits comparisons of carcinogenic potency and many other aspects of cancer tests, including for each experiment the species and strain of test animal, the route and duration of compound administration, dose level and other aspects of experimental protocol, histopathology and tumor incidence, TD50 (carcinogenic potency) and its statistical significance, dose response, author's opinion about carcinogenicity, and literature citation. A combined plot of all results from the four separate papers, which is ordered alphabetically by chemical, is available from L. S. Gold, in printed form or on computer tape or diskette. A computer readable (SAS) database is also available.
   The overview of papers includes descriptions of work on methods of estimating carcinogenic potency, reproducibility of results in near-replicate cancer tests, correlation in potency between species, ranking possible carcinogenic hazards, comparison of positivity. and target organ in rats and mice, comparison of mutagens and nonmutagens, proportion of chemicals positive in animal tests, natural compared to synthetic chemicals, and mechanistic issues in interspecies extrapolation.

AB Insect pest problems on cowpeas can be reduced by use of strategies which involve ecological manipulations. These include crop diversification (mixed cropping, etc.), alteration of planting dates, crop rotation, trap-cropping and weed control. The merits of these cultural methods of pest control are discussed.
   The status of biological control of cowpea pests is still low but promising. The crop is an annual and therefore offers very limited possibilities for the application of the classical biological control techniques. However, a large number of parasitic Hymenoptera, Diptera and predatory Hemiptera, notably Reduviids have been identified in the cowpea ecosystem. Ecological studies of some of these have been carried out and levels of parasitism determined in a few cases, but their significance in the dynamics of cowpea pest populations have not been fully established.
   It is however known that conservation of parasites and predators in their wild environment is one of the traditional biological control methods. Therefore, a rationalized pesticide programme for the control of cowpea pests should aim at preventing hazards to their natural enemies so as to increase their biocontrol efficiency.

DE ASSESSMENT; CONTAMINATION; CRITERIA; IDENTIFICATION; INVESTIGATION; LAND
AB The identification of contaminated land and its associated problems is a multi-stage process covering the first suspicion of contamination through to the final assessment in which hazards and risks are determined so that appropriate remedial measures can be taken.  In the UK, an effort has always been made to distinguish between the existence of 'contamination', and any assumption that this automatically implies the existence of a 'problem'.  The task is to identify contaminated land which might currently, or in the future, pose a threat to (a) human welfare, (b) the environment, or (c) natural resources.  This can be achieved through an appropriately designed site investigation and subsequent careful assessment of the results.
   This paper is intended as a broad look at identification, investigation, and assessment processes.

AB Aquatic microbial communities contain many species performing several critical functions in aquatic ecosystems and, thus, may provide robust indicators of stress.  Effects of the cationic surfactant dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (C12-TMAC) on benthic microbial communities in experimental stream channels were assessed.  Tests were performed with microbial communities:  (1) developed in the stream channels for 14 days prior to exposure; (2) developed in the presence of the chemical; (3) developed in the relatively unimpacted headwaters of the stream providing water to the facility for 16 days prior to exposure.  Gross indicators of community structure, such as the taxon richness and composition of the protozoan and diatom assemblages tended to be unaffected by the chemical.  Effects on growth processes and trophic relationships were generally transitory and occurred at moderate concentrations (250-mu-g/l) of cationic surfactant.  Most sensitive single species responses to this chemical in previous laboratory tests were more sensitive than overall community responses examined here and elsewhere.  However, broad assessments of risk using these communities allow for:  (1) validation of single species responses, and (2) predictions of potential long-term effects on natural ecosystems unavailable from single species tests.  This should allow for increased precision in risk assessments.

AB In recent years, people have become increasingly concerned about environmental hazards, including 'chemicals' which they perceive to be dangerous to health. One area of particular concern is chemicals in the food chain-meaning manmade additives and agrochemical residues, rather than the chemicals that are, inevitably, naturally present. In fact, many 'natural' chemicals can cause health problems ...

AB A cohort of 111 HIV-infected haemophiliacs has been followed for up to 11 years, during which time 33 patients have been diagnosed with AIDS. Twenty-seven of the cohort developed detectable p24 antigenaemia while remaining free of AIDS. These patients experienced an increased risk of progression to AIDS compared with those patients who were persistently p24-negative (relative risk 7.24; P < 0.0001, Cox proportional hazards model). The relative risk was reduced to 5.42 (P < 0.0001) after adjustment for age and cytomegalovirus seropositivity. After adjustment for the patients' declining CD4 lymphocyte count during follow-up, the relative risk fell dramatically to 1.97 and became non-significant (P = 0.2). p24-antigenaemic patients tended to develop AIDS at levels of similar CD4 lymphocyte counts to those who were persistently p24-antigen-negative (median CD4 lymphocyte counts, 70 and 50 x 10(6)/l, respectively). These results suggests that the association between p24 antigenaemia and the rate of progression to AIDS can be explained largely by a more rapid decline in CD4 lymphocyte count among patients with p24 antigenaemia than in those without. The major pathological effects of increased plasma viral load, as detected by the presence or absence of p24 antigenaemia, appear to act via progressive CD4 lymphocyte depletion.

AB Protection from the hazards from radioactivity is of prime importance in the management of uranium mine and mill wastes.  Such wastes also contain non-radiological contaminants (heavy metals, acids and neutralising agents) which give rise to potential long-term health and environmental hazards and short-term hazards to the aquatic ecosystem, e.g. as a result of release of waste water.  This study seeks to identify non-radiological contaminants (elements) transferred to waste water at the Ranger uranium mine/mill complex at Jabiru, which are likely to hazardous to the aquatic environment.
   The two principal sources of contaminants are:  (i) ore and waste rock mobilised from mining; and (ii) process reagents used in the milling and mineral extraction process.  These substances may or may not already be present in the natural environment but may lead to deleterious effects on the aquatic environment if increased above threshold levels.
   Rhenium, derived from the ore body, was found to be significantly enriched in waste water from Ranger, indicating its suitability as an indicator element for water originating from the mining and milling process, but only uranium, likewise derived from the ore, and magnesium, manganese and sulfur (as sulfate) from the milling process were found to be significant environmental contaminants.

AB To estimate the seismic hazard to underground facilities or operations in the environs of a mining-induced tremor or a natural earthquake, it is useful to be able to relate locally recorded seismic waveforms to peak ground velocity and slip at the causative fault.  For this purpose, far-field S wave pulses are analyzed to define the faulting slip D and near-fault peak ground velocity D/2 that give rise to the most significant ground motion.  This most intense region of faulting, an assumed circular asperity, has radius r within a broader source zone of radius r0, which is traditionally calculated from the corner frequency of the S wave spectrum.  In developing relationships between peak far-field velocity v and peak acceleration a, and the source processes of the asperity, D and D, as well as its radius r, the key model assumption is that r = k-beta/omega, where omega is the angular frequency of the sinusoidal velocity pulse of maximum amplitude, beta is the shear wave speed, and k is a constant.  Observations in deep-level gold mines of fault slip and slip velocity as well as laboratory observations of slip rate as a function of stress drop for stick-slip failure support a choice of about k = 2.34, the value commonly used for estimating r0 using the Brune model.  In particular, observations of fault slip up to 410 mm for mining-induced tremors in the moment magnitude range 4-5 are consistent with D = 8.1 Rv/beta, where R is hypocentral distance.  Moreover, estimates based on underground damage of near-fault ground velocities ranging up to 3.5 m/s are in accord with D/2 = 1.28(beta/mu)rho-Ra, where-mu is the modulus of rigidity and rho is the density.  Alternatively, the average slip velocity <D> can be expressed in terms of the stress drop DELTA-sigma-a of the asperity as <D> = 0.51 beta-DELTA-sigma-a/mu, and the agreement of this relationship with measurements made during stick-slip failure in the laboratory is good.  To the extent that seismic slip exterior to the asperity is a consequence of preevent suppression of slip due to the asperity, the broader-scale (r0) slip can be related to that of the asperity.  Just as the asperity radius r can be estimated from r = 2.34-beta-v/a, an alternative estimate for r0 is given by r0 = rho-RaM0/[75.8-rho-mu(Rv)2], the results of which are generally in good agreement with estimates based on the spectral corner frequency method.

TI HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA IN ITALIAN PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS
SO NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background and Methods.  Patients with cirhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.  The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown.  To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months.
   Results.  Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48).  The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetaprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255).  Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors.  The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027).  The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent.  Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery.
   Conclusions.  In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent.  Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors.

TI MINIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH-EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a growing worldwide concern over the toxicological hazards caused by agricultural pesticides to humans, animals and desirable plants in developing countries. This is not only because of the undesirable side effects caused but, more importantly, is due to the potential long-term exposure of such chemical to nontarget living forms. The problems that have been identified include current pesticide use patterns. Hence, it is necessary for developing countries to put in place sustainable programs to reduce such pesticide effects to the barest minimum. This paper examines the efforts one developing country has made to achieve this and practicable options opened to other countries. Such options include strategies to regulate the use of pesticides and prevent undue exposure of farmers to pesticides; restricting the use of persistent chemicals; alternatives to pesticide use, such as biological and natural control measures within the concept of integrated pest management practices, should be vigorously pursued.

AB The present paper derives various survival tests and their optimality results for randomly censored lifetime data by an extension of familiar rank test arguments.  The approach is based on local asymptotic normal models which have a natural interpretation in terms of hazard rates.  In particular, the description of classical rank tests by hazard rates may be of separate interest.  As an application of the new methods, a justification of conditional survival tests is given also under unequal censoring distributions.  It turns out that censoring is a nuisance phenomenon which asymptotically drops out.  Conditional tests are exact permutation tests which are shown to be equivalent to their unconditional counterparts.  They have all kinds of optimality properties and can be recommended for applications at least in those cases when a model with equal censorship cannot be excluded under the null hypothesis.

AB As a means of assessing the importance of variation in treatment effect among patient subsets, we derived posterior distributions for subset-specific treatment effects.  The effects are represented by combinations of terms for treatment and treatment-by-covariate interaction effects in familiar regression models.  Exchangeability among the interactions is a key assumption; thus, the results are of interest primarily in the context of examining a collection of subsets with no definite a priori distinction relative to treatment effect.  Exchangeability leads to a shrinking of the posterior distributions of the interaction terms toward the natural origin of 0, offsetting the tendency of the estimated effects to disperse.
   The method is applied to parameter estimates from a proportional hazards regression analysis of survival data from a clinical trial, invoking the approximate multivariate normal distribution of the estimates.  No subjective prior distributions are required.  Vague priors are used for all of the regression coefficients except the treatment-by-covariate interactions, which are assumed to follow a normal distribution.

TI RISK AND INFORMATION - A HEDONIC PRICE STUDY IN THE NEW-ZEALAND

SO ECONOMIC RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID FREQUENCY; MODEL; TESTS
AB This paper employs the hedonic price approach developed by Rosen (1974) and recently extended to study the effects of potential natural hazards on consumer behaviour. Hedonic prices are used to estimate home buyers willingness to pay to avoid a high-pressure gas pipeline installed in a residential area. Studies of risk and information (eg. Brookshire et al., 1985, Smith and Johnson, 1988) suggest that the subjective probability of a hazard occurring differs from the objective probability. If we allow for this, and relax the assumption of full information on the part of home buyers, our theoretical analysis indicates that a single hedonic price is not sufficient because hedonic prices are likely to change with a change in information. Our empirical analysis of cross-sectional data across time is in accord with the theoretical model, although not highly significant.

AB Japan has experienced many major natural disasters caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, and other hazards, because it is located on very active island-arc systems.  This has encourage the study of natural disasters.  Earthquake prediction started as a national project in 1966, and it is now in its sixth 5-year program.  The earthquake observation network has been expanded, and data-analysis methods have been greatly modernized.  The prediction of volcanic eruptions has also proceeded as a national project and is in its fourth 5-year program.  Predictions for each volcano have been successful owing to a variety of monitoring methods selected on the basis of differences in magmatic character.  Landslide disaster has been greatly mitigated through developments in the prediction of their site, type, magnitude, and occurrence time, in addition to the building of extensive control works.  Recently, time prediction of landsliding has become highly reliable through the monitoring of ground movement.

TI QUANTITATION OF NATURAL-KILLER-CELL FUNCTION AND RISK OF METASTATIC
   POORLY DIFFERENTIATED HEAD AND NECK-CANCER
SO NATURAL IMMUNITY AND CELL GROWTH REGULATION
LA English
DT Article
DE CANCER, HEAD AND NECK; NATURAL KILLER CELL
AB Previous laboratory studies have suggested that natural immunity is a primordial defense mechanism against blood-borne metastatic cancer, its function being most effective against dedifferentiated, low-major-histocompatibility-complex-class-I-antigen-expressing tumors. In this clinical study, 263 previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were evaluated for natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity mediated by peripheral blood lymphocytes against K562 target cells. All patients were evaluated before treatment, underwent subsequent attempts at curative therapy in which they were initially rendered disease-free, and then followed longitudinally for clinical outcome. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, quantitated NK cell cytotoxicity was inversely related to subsequent death with disease (p = 0.05), regional metastases (p = 0.008) and distant metastases (p = 0.03). No relationship between NK cell function and local recurrence could be identified (p = 0.81). Patients were further stratified by degree of differentiation of their respective primary cancer. The prognostic implication provided as to risk of death with disease and progressive metastatic growth was confined to the population with moderate-to-poorly differentiated cancers. Conversely, its function was nonpredictive in patients with well-differentiated cancers; the latter cancers were observed to express higher levels of major histocompatibility complex-class I framework antigens. Results of this clinical study are consistent with previous laboratory investigations and suggest that, within humans, the NK cell functions in metastatic sites against more primitive cancers. Such findings may have implications in designing therapeutic strategies.

AB This paper considers the role of information technology in forecasting, monitoring and managing disasters in real-time (i.e., by analysis of data as soon as they are collected).  First, the advantages and pitfalls of a technological approach to natural hazards are discussed, then the general nature of real-time technology is described.  There follows a review of the appropriate techniques of monitoring the physical impacts of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and landslides.  Next the role of information technology in disaster management is assessed, with emphasis on telecommunications and simulation modelling.  As a cautionary note, two notorious failures of prediction and warning are discussed (the strom of October 1987 in England and the volcanic eruption diaster of November 1985 in Colombia), both of which would have benefited from more careful use of real-time monitoring.  It is concluded that microcomputers, earth resources satellites, communications satellites and Geographical Information Systems offer considerable potential for natural disaster management, especially if real-time uses are developed by integrating these technologies.

AB Objective:  To investigate the relation between CD4 count and the immediate hazard of dying in patients receiving zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT])-based antiretroviral therapy.
   Setting:  A research hospital that recruits patients from the entire United States.
   Design:  Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex participating in long-term zidovudine-based antiretroviral protocols.
   Patients:  Fifty-five patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and either AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex who were followed for as many as 4 years while they received antiretroviral therapy.
   Measurements:  CD4 counts were measured.
   Main Results:  Ten patients are known to be alive and 1 was lost to follow-up. Of the 44 patients who are known to have died, the CD4 range was known within 6 months of death in 41. All but 1 of these 41 assessable deaths occurred in patients whose CD4 counts were known to have fallen below 50 CD4 cells/mm3 (p < 10(-10)). The hazard of dying in the cohort ranged from 0 deaths/patient-month (95% Cl, 0 to 0.008 deaths/patient-month) in patients with 200 or more CD4 cells/mm3 to 0.07 deaths/patient-month (Cl, 0.050 to 0.094 deaths/patient-month) in patients with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3. For the patients who died and whose cases were assessable, the mean of the last three CD4 counts obtained before death was 7.7 CD4 cells/mm3 (Cl, 0.9 to 63.3 cells/mm3). The median survival of patients once their CD4 counts fell below 50 CD4 cells/mm3 was 12.1 months (Cl, 7.2 to 19.4 months).
   Conclusions:  In a carefully followed cohort treated with zidovudine-based antiretroviral therapy, nearly all deaths occurred in patients with fewer than 50 CD4 cells/mm3.  These findings may have implications in the monitoring of patients with AIDS and in the use of CD4 count as a clinical trials end point for the antiretroviral therapy of HIV infection.

ID CHILDHOOD-CANCER; MAGNETIC-FIELDS
AB Societal concern with possible adverse effects of new technology has increased, with public pressure to carefully examine potential health consequences.  Epidemiology, in which patterns of disease in free-living populations are examined, provides an important component of assessing such risks.  This approach is illustrated by the study of residential magnetic field exposure in relation to childhood cancer.  The key challenge to epidemiology is the observational rather than experimental assignment of exposure, raising the possibility that some correlate of the exposure of interest (e.g., air pollution) is responsible for any observed effects.  Exposures themselves are difficult to quantify accurately, especially when a long-term exposure history is of concern.  On the other hand, study of the appropriate species (humans) under the exposure conditions of ultimate concern (natural environment) compensates for those limitations.  Interpretation of epidemiologic data requires careful consideration of the quality of measurement, with random errors likely to obscure any true relations.  Other aspects of the study design also deserve scrutiny, with speculation about potential biases essential for the development of improved studies.  Although the difficulties in quantifying exposure, threat of bias, and frequent inconsistency of results place limitations on epidemiology, it should and probably will continue to play a key role in the development of exposure standards.

AB Chronosequences of fuelbeds resulting from precommercial thinning and blowdown in Douglas-fir were measured using standard fuel inventory techniques.   Non-linear least squares regressions were fitted to the resulting data.  Results confirmed that precommercial thinning slash loses half its original loading and depth within two years.  By comparison with published results, the same change in similar fuelbeds in ponderosa pine takes 15 years.  Foliage retention on twigs and branches was nil after one year compared to ponderosa pine which retained fifty percent or more of its foliage for at least three years.
   Changes in blowdown fuels mirror those in slash, except that more material is present initially.  Fine fuels (less than three inches in diameter) fall to background levels within two to four years.  Large fuels persist longer and decay more slowly but eventually melt away.
   Sound logs become rotten after about 80 years.  Findings of this study corroborate similar findings by others, namely that fire hazard in precommercial thinning slash is satisfactorily abated after three years; abatement is similar in blowdown but fuel depth and large fuel loadings decrease more slowly.

AB This paper addresses approaches for assessing potential human health hazards from the presence of natural toxicants, such as mycotoxins, in animal food products.  At high levels in feed these mycotoxins may cause loss or illness of farm animals, through development of animal toxicoses, such as aflatoxicosis.  At lower levels in feed these mycotoxins may have no apparent effect on livestock production, but their residues and related substances may move up the food chain.  This indirect intake of mycotoxins and related substances from the consumption of animal food products may pose a health hazard to humans.  These health hazarads are compared to the possible health hazards from the direct intake by humans of cereal and other food crops that may contain mycotoxins.

AB The impact of navigationally induced suspended sediments from the Upper Great Lakes Connecting Channels on the size-fractionated primary productivity was evaluated by the Carbon-14 technique. The method applied was on-site, rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and provided dynamic-toxicological information essential for hazard assessment. Both enhancement and inhibition of the primary productivity was observed in various parts of the Upper Great Lakes Connecting Channels. These responses appear to depend on the type of natural plankton and their exposure to various contaminant/nutrient complexes generated by the disturbance of the bottom sediments during the passage of ships. Traditionally, only the inhibition of primary productivity has been monitored from a toxicity point of view, but it is important also to evaluate the implications of enhancement since it may result in increased eutrophication, propagation of nuisance blooms, and change of intricate food-web interactions. The procedure adopted in this study for the first time appears to possess considerable potential for a simple and rapid screening of environmental perturbations resulting from navigational activities.

TI PARTIAL OXIDATION OF METHANE TO SYNTHESIS GAS-USING CARBON-DIOXIDE
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article

AB INCREASING concern about world dependence on petroleum oil has generated interest in the more efficient use of natural gas 1-4. The conversion of methane to the common feedstock synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen) by steam reforming is already well established 5, and we have shown recently that yields of synthesis gas in excess of 90% can be obtained at moderate temperatures and ambient pressure by partial oxidation, with air or oxygen, over supported transition-metal catalysts 6,7. The use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for conversion of natural gas to synthesis gas is well established in steam reforming 5, and is also known in CO2 reforming (for example, the Calcor process 8,9), in which the use of excess CO2 yields mainly CO. In the present work, we describe an alternative catalytic strategy for CO2 reforming which gives excellent yields (90%) from a stoichiometric (1:1) feed of CO2 and CH4. Carbon deposition ('coking'), which is a hazard of CO2-reforming routes, is suppressed here by the use of catalysts based on platinum-group metals. We show that the exothermic partial oxidation of CH4 and the endothermic CO2- reforming reaction can be carried out simultaneously, thus introducing the possibility of tuning the thermodynamics of the process.

AB Studies of earth cycles are used in a variety of ways, from mineral exploration to recording and explaining past, and projecting future climate change.  Geology helps us find the commodities we need to accomodate our lifestyles, to assess natural hazards, find drinking water and safe places to dispose of our waste.  As mankind will search for a way to achieve a globally sustainable society, the limits of this planet will have to be acknowledged.  Geology is one of the disciplines that can help us understand our planet and establish those limits.  Further research in the earth sciences is required to clarify our present knowledge of the environment, quantify many processes, and define limits of prediction for future change.

AB Background.  Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial.
   Methods and Results.  We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients.  Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%).  Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07.  Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation.  Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction.  After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died:  56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure.  Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%.  Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013).  Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013).  By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death.  For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%).
   Conclusions.  Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy.  Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown.

AB Increased use of the world's natural resources, including water bodies such as the Chesapeake Bay, has resulted in additional burdens being placed on them.  If continued, unrestricted use of such resources continues, degradation will occur to such an extent that some areas will be unsuitable for economic, social, and environmental uses.  Regional risk assessment strategies must be developed so that actual or perceived risks can be evaluated and predicted on a regional scale.  This article presents an initial strategy for the Chesapeake Bay that may be useful to scientists, managers, and elected officials responsible for other bodies of water as well.  This article reviews risk assessment practices and proposes a strategy that utilizes appropriate endpoints to ascertain and predict risk.

TI REVIEW OF METHANOL AND COMPRESSED NATURAL-GAS (CNG) AS ALTERNATIVE FOR
   TRANSPORTATION FUELS
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Concern over the environment and a potential oil shortage has resulted in an intensified research for alternative fuels for the transportation sector.  Two fuels given strong consideration are methanol and compressed natural gas (CNG).  This paper is a comprehensive comparative study of methanol and CNG as transportation fuels.  The physical properties of methanol and CNG are discussed.  The various concerns, such as source and potential fuel supply, safety, toxicity and health hazards, engine performance and emissions, fuel storage, fuel tank and refueling of these alternative fuels are addressed briefly in this paper.  We find that no single alternative fuel is best in all categories.  The merits and drawbacks of each fuel are tabulated and the vehicle characteristics are compared with gasoline.  The study concludes that the neat methanol may be considered as an alternative for passenger cars and CNG may be considered for fleets, light and heavy-duty vehicles as the best near-term solution.

AB Background and Methods.  We sought to describe the trends in survival from 1983 to 1989 among persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and to examine the relative effects on the natural history of AIDS of zidovudine use and demographic and clinical characteristics.  This longitudinal, observational, population-based study used data from the Maryland Human Immunodeficiency Virus Information System, a data base that links information from the Maryland AIDS Registry with data on public and private health care claims, vital statistics, and hospital, long-term care, and ambulatory care records.
   Results.  The median survival after diagnosis among persons with AIDS (n = 1028) was 140 days longer for those given their diagnoses between 1987 and 1989 than for those given their diagnoses between 1983 and 1985 (450 vs. 310 days).  Among the 714 persons in whom AIDS was diagnosed after April 1987 (when zidovudine became available), two-year survival was greater among men than women (P < 0.03), among persons less than 45 years old than among older persons (P < 0.001), among non-Hispanic whites than among minorities (P < 0.001), and among persons whose category of human immunodeficiency virus transmission was homosexual contact than among those with heterosexual, transfusion-related, or less common modes of transmission (P < 0.02).  In all the analyses the groups with the longer survival were more likely to have received zidovudine.  The median survival among those who received zidovudine was 770 days, as compared with 190 days among those who never received the drug (P < 0.001).  By proportional-hazards analysis, zidovudine therapy was the factor most strongly associated with improved survival.
   Conclusions.  For Maryland residents with AIDS there has been an improvement in survival since 1987.  Zidovudine therapy and perhaps other aspects of care associated with it have contributed substantially to the improved survival.

AB Objective:  To identify risk factors for infusion-related phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheters.
   Design:  A randomized trial of two catheter materials, with consideration of 21 potential risk factors.
   Setting:  A university hospital.
   Patients:  Hospitalized adults without granulocytopenia who received a peripheral intravenous catheter.
   Interventions:  House officers or ward nurses inserted the catheters, and each insertion was randomized to a catheter made of tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene (FEP-Teflon) or a novel polyetherurethane without leachable additives (PEU-Vialon).
   Measurements:  Research nurses scored insertion sites each day for inflammation and cultured catheters at removal.
   Results:  The Kaplan-Meier risk for phlebitis exceeded 50% by day 4 after catheterization.  Intravenous antibiotics (relative risk, 2.00), female sex (relative risk, 1.88), prolonged (> 48 hours) catheterization(relative risk, 1.79), and catheter material (PEU-Vialon:  FEP-Teflon) (relative risk, 0.73) strongly predicted phlebitis in a Cox proportional hazards model (each, P < 0.003).  The best-fit model for severe phlebitis identified the same predictors plus catheter-related infection (relative risk, 6.19), phlebitis with a previous catheter (relative risk, 1.54), and anatomic site (hand:  forearm, relative risk, 0.71; wrist:forearm, relative risk, 0.60).  The low incidence of local catheter-related infection was comparable wwith the two catheter materials (5.4% [95% CI, 3.8% to 7.6%] and 6.9% [CI, 4.9% to 9.6%]); none of the 1054 catheters prospectively studied caused bacteremia.
   Conclusions:  Multiple factors, including the infusate and the duration of cannulation, contribute to the development of infusion-related phlebitis.  The use of peripheral intravenous catheters made of PEU-Vialon appears to pose the same risk for catheter-related infection as the use of catheters made of FEP-Teflon, and PEU-Vialon can permit longer cannulation with less risk for phlebitis.
   The risk for catheter-related bacteremia with FEP-Teflon and PEU-Vialon catheters is sufficiently low that it no longer seems justifiable to recommend the use of small steel needles for most peripheral intravenous therapy.

DT Article
DE GENETIC MANIPULATION; NATURAL FLORA
AB Genetic manipulation resulting in transgenic plants may cause hazards to the wild flora. Some of these hazards can be listed and a few quantified. To do this, all links in the chain of possible undesirable events have to be identified. The paper discusses some methodological issues. The methodology may lead us to predict some undesirable events and their probability but cannot help us to differentiate the undesirable from the acceptable. That decision must result from political consensus which should be based on informed opinion.

ID COLON CANCER; PROLONGED SURVIVAL; CARCINOMA; POPULATION; HISTORY;
   BREAST; RISK
AB Familial cases of non-polyposis colorectal cancer have attracted much interest but little is known of their natural history.  Using a population based study we have determined whether a positive family history of bowel cancer is an independent prognostic factor.  All patients under 55 years with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer in Northern Ireland during the period 1976-8 were studied.  The family history was validated in 95% of all non-polyposis cases (n = 205).  Medical history or cause of death were verified for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives.  The strength of the family history was assessed using a score that compares the mortality from bowel cancer in the family against the average population mortality, taking account of family size and age structure.  The family history score was not predictive of survival neither in univariate analysis or in a Cox's proportional hazards multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, stage, site, and duration of symptoms.  In conclusion, a positive family history does not independently influence prognosis in patients with bowel cancer.

TI SCATTERING OF SHORT-WAVE GROUPS BY SUBMERGED HORIZONTAL PLATE
SO JOURNAL OF WATERWAY PORT COASTAL AND OCEAN ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID REFLECTION; CYLINDER; FORCES
AB A fully submerged horizontal plate has been suggested as a break-water.  With a proper design in the length, thickness, and submerged depth of the plate, most of the incoming short waves can indeed be reflected.  The method of eigenfunction expansion is used to solve for the reflection and transmission of the short waves.  The present results agreed with earlier experimental data and computations.  If the incident wave is bichromatic, a second-order long wave train accompanies the wave groups.  This long wave train is also scattered by the horizontal plate.  It is shown here that the scattered long waves exist on both sides of the horizontal plate even when the short waves are completely reflected.  The long waves may prove to be a bigger hazard than the short waves, because the wave period of the long wave (1-3 min) is closer to the natural frequency of coastal structures.

AB Toxicology studies of synthetic chemicals at high doses must be viewed in the context of the world of natural chemicals, which make up the vast bulk of the chemicals to which humans are exposed.  In tests at near toxic doses (e.g., the maximum tolerated dose), one-half of all chemicals, whether synthetic or natural, are carcinogens; one-third are teratogens, and about half are clastogens.  Natural and synthetic chemicals are similar in their toxicology, and at the low doses of most human exposures where cell-killing does not occur, the hazards may be much lower than are commonly assumed and often will be zero.  It is shown that the comparative hazards of dioxin at the levels that are causing concern appear insignificant.

TI POTENTIAL HEALTH-EFFECTS OF GREENHOUSE-EFFECT AND OZONE-LAYER DEPLETION
   IN AUSTRALIA
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective:  To identify potential health effects of the greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion in Australia.
   Data sources:  Data were derived from a number of sources:  (i) published articles accessed from relevant databases in the disciplines of health, public health and climatology over the past 20 years; (ii) published conference proceedings, review monographs and government reports covering the topic; (iii) a survey of experts in public health and climatology/geography (150 individuals were surveyed in the first phase with a 63% response rate); and (iv) a consensus conference in which 22 invited experts reviewed the results of the literature review and survey and a second conference in which 18 senior members of the health bureaucracy and public health profession considered the implications of the findings.
   Study selection:  Over 200 published articles or monographs were reviewed.  Criteria for selection were whether the papers contributed information to the objectives of the review.
   Data extraction:  Because of the nature of the problem under investigation, predictions based on reasonable scientific assumptions were the major content of the review rather than conclusions based on scientific research.
   Data synthesis:  The major predicted health effects of long-term climatic change in Australia are skin and eye damage from increased ultraviolet radiation exposure, increased incidence of some respiratory diseases, vector-borne and water-borne diseases, and the social and physical effects of natural hazards and social and economic restructuring.  The most vulnerable groups include the aged, the very young, the chronically ill, those living in poorly designed neighbourhoods and those working in outdoor occupations or heavy industry.
   Conclusions:  The potential effects on health of long-term climatic change cover the broad spectrum of public health concerns.  Detailed predictions of likely problems in specific geographic areas are not yet possible, but progressive development of such predictive capability is a high priority.  Doctors will have an increasingly important role in monitoring local health status and participating in disease prevention and surveillance programmes.

AB To determine the relationships between individuals' baseline T-cell subsets, their rates of change with time, and AIDS-free survival time, data were collected at 6-monthly intervals from 379 HIV-seropositive homosexual Sydney men, of whom 31 developed AIDS during the 3-year observation period.  Both CD4% and rate of change of CD4% in an individual had significant prognostic value in determinign AIDS-free survival time.  Compared with subjects whose CD4% remained stable, subjects whose CD4% dropped by 7% or more in a year had a relative hazard of 35.1 (95% confidence interval = 11.7-105.6, P < 0.001) of developing AIDS.  Increasing CD4% had a significant protective effect, reducing the risk of developing AIDS. CD4%, CD4 cell count and CD4:CD8 ratios showed steeper declines in subjects who were later diagnosed with AIDS than in those who remained AIDS-free.  The rates of immunological change in AIDS-free seroconverters and seropositives were similar, despite indeterminate differences in durations of infections.  In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, baseline CD4%, the rate of change of CD4%, and baseline lymphocyte count were associated with AIDS-free survival time.  Baseline CD4% had greater prognostic value than baseline CD4 cell count.  Baseline CD8%, baseline CD8 count, their rates of change and their mean square errors were not independently significant in this analysis.  These findings are important for clinicians monitoring HIV infection in an individual and for entry criteria and monitoring procedures in clinical trials.  They also have implications for resource-poor settings; prognosis based on CD4% can be made with a flow cytometer without a full blood count.  Data were collected before zidovudine was available and thus reflect the natural history of HIV infection.

TI STILL RETORT STERILIZATION PROCESS FOR CANNED PIMENTO PEPPERS
   (CAPSICUM-ANNUUM-L)
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO
LA English
DT Article
AB Pimiento peppers have a natural pH of 4.6 to 5.2 and are usually acidified to a pH value lower than 4.6 so that they can be safely processed at atmospheric pressure.  The main purpose of acidifying to a pH lower than 4.6 is to eliminate the potential hazard of Clostridium botulinum growth.  The objective of this study was to establish a retort sterilization process that could accelerate the plant canning procedure of pimiento peppers without affecting the canned fruit quality, especially in terms of texture.  The study was accomplished with the facilities of the Planta Procesadora de Villalba, in the southern part of the island.  The pimientos were placed in 211 x 300 tin cans with an acidified (0.4% citric acid) 2% brine solution and subjected to three different thermal processes:  heating for 3 and 4 minutes at 245-degrees-F, and heating in boiling water for 30 minutes (used as a standard).  The 245-degrees-F thermal processes had an F value of .03 minutes (z = 10) for the 3-minute process, and an F value of 0.16 minutes (z = 10) for the 4-minute process.  This was calculated by the Patashnik numerical method.  The calculated thermal processes, graphically determined by the General Method of Bigelow, was 2.5 minutes for F = 0.03 and 3.5 minutes for F = 0.16, both at 245-degrees-F.  The recommended thermal process is 4 minutes at 245-degrees-F with an initial temperature of no less than 170-degrees-F, or 30 minutes in boiling water (212-degrees-F).

ID INFILTRATION
AB Little quantitative site-specific infiltration, runoff, and erosion data for forested watershed soils of the Tahoe Basin are available.  A Modular-type rainfall simulator was used to examine these variables for the Cagwin (mixed Typic Cryopsammet) soil series.  Three slop (0-15, 15-30, > 30%) and four plot conditions (undisturbed with natural duff, undisturbed without natural duff, disturbed without natural duff, and disturbed with natural duff removed) were studied.  Infiltration and runoff data were incorporated into a modified Philip's model whereas erosion data were incorporated into a geneal nonlinear model.  Data sets were analyzed via nonlinear regression for slope and plot interaction.  Slope had negligible effect on infiltration and runnoff but had a significant effect on erosion.  Plot condition had significant effects on infiltration, runoff, and erosion.  Final infiltration rates ranged from 4.7 to 6.1 cm h-1, runoff ranged from 36 to 59% of the application rates, and cumulative interrill erosion ranged from 37.5 to 108.4 g m-2 for a simulated design strom of 8 to 10 cm h-1.  The findings of this investigation were consistent with those of related quantitative investigations and indicate that the Cagwin soil has a low relative erosivity.  Data from this study further suggest that previously applied models used to estimate potential erosion hazards of forested watershed soils may well result in over-estimation of erosion potential.

TI A GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEM TO ASSESS NATURAL HAZARDS IN THE
   EAST-CENTRAL SIERRA-NEVADA
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural hazards such as landslides, avalanches, and shallow groundwater tables are potential areas of risk to life and property in mountainous regions.  Increased development for a growing population and increased recreation use means more damage from these natural hazards is possible in the future.  The east-central Sierra Nevada is such an area.
   Planners desiring to be more effective need to have more information to prevent damage due to hazards of living in underdeveloped mountainous areas.  A Geographic Information System is a computer based technique which offers a way to develop this information on hazards by using a few key variables.  It offers the advantage of using variables in different combinations to address different hazards in the same area, and it shows where these hazards are likely to occur.  This paper describes the selection of the basic processes or attributes of the hazards, assembly of the data base, the analysis, and some examples of the results taken from a test site near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

AB O'Brien's logit-rank procedure (1978, Biometrics 34, 243-250) is shown to arise as a score test based on the partial likelihood for a proportional hazards model provided the covariate structure is suitably defined.  Within this framework the asymptotic properties claimed by O'Brien can be readily deduced and can be seen to be valid under a more general model of censoring than that considered in his paper.  More important, perhaps, it is now possible to make a more natural and interpretable generalization to the multiple regression problem than that suggested by O'Brien as a means of accounting for the effects of nuisance covariates.  This can be achieved either by modelling or stratification.  The proportional hazards framework is also helpful in that it enables us to recognize the logit-rank procedure as being one member of a class of contending procedures.  One consequence of this is that the relative efficiencies of any two procedures can be readily evaluated using the results of Lagakos (1988, Biometrika 75, 156-160).  Our own evaluations suggest that, for non-time-dependent covariates, a simplification of the logit-rank procedure, leading to considerable reduction in computational complexity, is to be preferred to the procedure originally outlined by O'Brien.

LA English
DT Article
AB Disasters take about 250,000 lives and cause US$40 billion in damage each year.  Human suffering and economic losses have been rising during the last two decades.  Humankind is becoming increasingly vulnerable because development concentrates population, infrastructure, and economic resources.  By its resolution 44/236, of December 22, 1989, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed the Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, beginning January 1, 1990.  The International Framework of Action sets goals, policy measures to be taken at the national level, and action to be taken by the United Nations system.  The organizational arrangements include a Special High-Level Council, a Scientific and Technical Committee, and a Secretariat, with financing from extrabudgetary resources through a trust fund.  There is a considerable level of national participation-seventy-two national committees or focal points have been established.  The overall objective of the Decade is to prevent-or mitigate-natural disasters worldwide.  Global and regional efforts must be mobilized to bring to bear the latest understandings and advancements in science and technology on natural disaster prevention.  Strategies to mitigate natural hazards require planning and building to withstand a hazard, identifying and avoiding the sites where hazards are likely, predicting the occurrence of hazards, and preventing or altering a hazard's characteristics.  Effective measures require understanding of the fundamental causes of disasters, of the nature of their effects, and of techniques for coping with the effects.  Encouraging research and development and bringing to bear its results are integral aspects of the decade.  Coupled with this objective is the absolute necessity for education and training of scientists and engineers who must carry out this work.  (Ed.)

TI HAZARD AND RISK ASSESSMENTS IN THE UNITED-STATES
SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB Every State and Territory in the United States has communities that are at risk from one or more of the natural hazards:  earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, severe storms (hurricanes and tornadoes), floods, landslides, wildfires, tsunamis, and drought.  During the 1990's, a period designated by the United Nations as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), the United States plans to marshall its intellectual, economic, and political resources to reduce loss of life, human suffering, and economic loss from these natural hazards.  Hazard and risk assessments will be an important element of the United States' program.  Such assessments are needed for the Nation's earthquake-prone zones, active volcanoes, thousands of miles of hurricane-prone coastline, large and small flood-producing drainage systems, slopes susceptible to landslides, regions prone to tornadoes, coasts susceptible to tsunami runup and storm surge, wilderness/urban interfaces vulnerable to wildfires, and regions subject to drought episodes.  The goal is to provide a sound scientific and technical basis for predictions and warnings, preparedness, and mitigation measures so that communities can make themselves less susceptible to disasters.  This paper describes the basic characteristics of the atmospheric, hydrologic, and geologic natural hazards the United States will face during the 1990's and its plans for reducing their impacts.

SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB SEISMED (Cooperative Project for Seismic Risk Reduction in the Mediterranean Region) and IDNDR (International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction) are new programs designed to provide opportunities to reduce the risk from earthquakes and other natural hazards.  The focus of SEISMED is on earthquakes in the Mediterranean region; whereas the focus of IDNDR is on eight natural hazards (earthquakes, severe storms, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, wildfires, and drought) throughout the world.  The goal of both programs is to reduce risk in the urban centers through coordinated societal, scientific, and technical actions.  Urban centers of the world will be made safer from natural hazards focusing on:  Avoidance of the physical phenomena, Wise use of the land, Emergency preparedness and diaster recovery planning, Reduction of vulnerability, Adoption and enforcement of building and zoning regulations, Coordinated planning, design, and construction practices, Modification of the characteristics of ground shaking and ground failure, and Prediction and warning.

TI DROUGHT - OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPACT MITIGATION
SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB Drought is an ancient natural hazard that has probably killed more people than any other.  It is difficult to mark the start and end of drought because the moisture deficit develops slowly over weeks, months, or years.  Atmospheric scientists can neither forecast nor control drought.  Drought mitigation must focus on reducing the underlying physical and social vulnerability.  Short-term adjustments do not yield a lasting adaptation to drought.  Some argue that repetitive food aid may worsen long-term food-production problems and land degradation by deferring more fundamental adjustments.  Decisionmakers need better information and a broader range of adjustment options in order to reduce drought vulnerability.  A linking of global warming/climate change studies with drought studies can yield insights into how societies might deal with climate change and help define the potential for future drought.  (Ed.)

TI TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER
SO EPISODES
LA English
DT Article
AB Fundamental knowledge on the nature and extent of the physical and societal impacts of earthquakes and ways to mitigate and prepare for them has advanced significantly during the 1990's.  However, transfer of technology (that is, the transfer of fundamental knowledge and know-how for use by society to achieve a practical purpose such as earthquake risk reduction) lags behind research because people and organizations are:  (a) paralyzed by apathy, (b) neutralized by narrow mindness, and (c) rendered powerless by ineffective actions.  Solutions to these constraints have begun to emerge and are expected to improve during the 1990's as existing national and regional programs in the US, such as those composing the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, are expanded and cooperative international programs, such as a seismic zonation study in Algeria and those of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, are initiated by individual nations throughout the world.

DT Article
DE LAND RECLAMATION; SEA-LEVEL RISE HAZARDS; BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY;
   PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; COASTAL EVOLUTION; AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
AB The evolution of estuarine and coastal wetland zones along the sector between the Deva and Bidasoa rivers, after the Flandrian maximun, is analyzed using air photographs, old maps and charts, and field observations.  The aims of this study were to quantify historical development of the land reclamation process in the area and to assess some of its environmental and economic consequences.
   The total area emerged during the post-Flandrian retreat was approximately 24 km2.  The new land areas formed afterwards cover some 73 km2.  Out of these, around 64 km2 are estimated to be due to direct human intervention (draining, filling and reclamation).  This artificial area represents 40% of the estuarine and wetland zones.
   Assuming an uniform rate of accretion (an obvious simplification) it appears that new land spaces were formed, through natural processes, at a rate of about 0.22 km2/century after the Flandrian retreat.  The approximate distribution of land-use types in the artificially created lands is:  36% agriculture, 22% industry, 14% residential, 13% others and 15% without use.
   A comparative assessment of the biological productivity, in terms of the monetary value of products obtained by the primary sector shows that the substitution of intertidal or wetland areas by agricultural lands represents, at present, a loss of about $US 250,000 km-2 year-1.  This substitution affects 58% of the reclaimed lands.  An estimate of the "willingness to pay" by the population, in order to preserve the aesthetic qualities and recreational potential of these areas indicates that the population of the region value this resource around $US 200 x 10(6) per year.
   The filled areas are, on the whole, less than 1 m above sea level.  Therefore, a sea level rise of about 1 m, as predicted by several models for the next centuries, would endanger 73 km2 of post-Flandrian natural and artificial lands.  The capital value of buildings, structures, etc. on this land has been estimated around $US 5,000 x 10(6).

TI INFORMATION-PROCESSING BY FORAGERS - EFFECTS OF INTRA-PATCH EXPERIENCE
   ON THE LEAVING TENDENCY OF LEPTOPILINA-HETEROTOMA
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
ID MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; PARASITIZATION; MODEL;
   HOSTS
AB (1) In this paper, the relation between the tendency to leave a patch and the experience in that patch is studied, from a functional point of view.
   (2) The study is based on empirical data rather than the usual a priori modelling. The relative effects of several factors on patch-leaving decisions are estimated from the data and it is tested which factors have significant effects. Afterwards, we discuss the implications of the effects that were found in a functional context.
   (3) This approach is an important extension to a priori modelling, since it can indicate the relative importance of several aspects of the natural environment in determining the foraging strategy.
   (4) Experiments were done with the parasitic wasp Leptopilina heterotoma. In the trials, wasps were deposited in a Petri dish containing a patch of yeast with Drosophila larvae. Their behaviour was continuously recorded until they left the patch for more than 60 s.
   (5) The data were analysed by means of the proportional hazards model (Cox 1972) for factors affecting the leaving tendency of the parasitoids, i.e. the chance per unit of time that the patch was left.
   (6) It was found that the leaving tendency decreases with the number of ovipositions.
   (7) Oviposition rates experienced in the patch also have a strong influence on the tendency of the wasps to leave. As expected, the most recently experienced oviposition rates have the strongest effect. Long foraging times between recent ovipositions produce a high leaving tendency.
   (8) The number of times the patch has been left before, during periods shorter than 60 s, also strongly influences the tendency to leave.
   (9) Rejection rates with parasitized hosts do not affect the leaving tendency significantly.
   (10) These findings suggest that the behaviour of the wasps is strongly adapted to a clumped distribution of hosts over patches.

AB We prospectively studied the relationship between serum creatinine and survival among 492 elderly subjects admitted for stroke and monitored for a mean period of 18 months post-stroke.  In multivariate proportional hazards models, serum creatinine remained an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.0001) after accounting for other important predictors such as level of consciousness.  Mini-Mental State Score, age, leucocyte count, presence of heart disease, diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and use of cardiovascular medication.  This association between elevated serum creatinine and mortality was also found in patient subgroups with CT-proven infarction and intracerebral haematoma.  It is concluded that serum creatinine is an independent predictor of survival after stroke.  Further studies are required to confirm this relationship and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

AB To examine the relationship between atrial fibrillation and mortality after stroke, we studied 186 men and 167 women from the Waikato Stroke Registry whose mean age was 75.2 +/- 7.5 years.  Twenty-three percent (82 of 353) had atrial fibrillation or flutter on their admission electrocardiogram.  This group differed significantly from that with sinus rhythm in three respects:  1) They were older (p < 0.01); 2) they had more severe current stroke deficit as evidenced by lower limb power (p < 0.05) and Mini-Mental State Score (p < 0.001), higher incidence of homonomous hemianopia (p < 0.05), and lower incidence of lacunar syndrome stroke (p < 0.001); and 3) they had a significantly higher incidence of cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure (p < 0.01).  Functional outcome was insignificantly better in the group with sinus rhythm.  During a mean follow-up period of 18 months, mortality was significantly higher in the group with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001).  Proportional hazards modeling, however, showed that the apparently poorer survival in those patients with atrial fibrillation could be explained by factors other than cardiac rhythm, such as age, Mini-Mental State Score, level of consciousness, and interstitial edema on admission chest radiograph.  Thus, atrial fibrillation was not an independent predictor of survival after stroke.

CY NOV 06-11, 1989
CL KYOTO, JAPAN
AB Architects today have at their disposal a rich variety of mechanical means to control the climatic environment in buildings they design.  Consequently, it has become a common tendency to rely entirely on engineers and their equipment to achieve comfortable climatic conditions in building spaces.  Yet, this attitude appears to carry along unwelcome side-effects:  not only has a building's initial cost risen considerably, but smooth functioning of artificial systems requires periodical and costly maintenance, in addition to the need for energy over the life of the building, and all this accompanied by other environmental drawbacks such as noise, pollution and various hazards.
   It is an unrealistic standpoint to reject what modern technology can provide to ensure a better building climatic environment.  However, instead of relying wholly on mechanical means, the architect should, through a meaningful design, direct his efforts to achieve the best possible natural climatic control which, then, may be supplemented by artificial processes.
   The paper discusses how vernacular architecture, sited in the extremely harsh conditions of the desert context, has tackled the issue of climatic regulation and efficiency relying only on natural means.

AB The current debate about such global issues as enhanced greenhouse gas warming should be most attractive to those geographers still interested in integrative issues.  It involves understanding scientific ideas and appreciating the complexities of the world in which remedial measures have to be sought.  Yet geographers have not turned enthusiastically to environmental issues, nor to such integrative topics as natural hazards.  This is good neither for the environmental debate, nor for the future of the subject in its interdisciplinary form.  Where contributions have been made they have not always concentrated on the larger issues, nor fully utilised concepts of scale over time and space.  Geographers should leave tidying the local environment and recycling cans to their spare time and try to get full academic advantage from the current environmental debate.

AB In this paper, the idea, construction and experiment study of a new isolation method using soil liquefaction is presented.  Reports about earthquake hazards and research work in laboratories have indicated that liquefied soil can be used as an isolation material, when some prerequisites are fulfilled.  After an experimental study of the soil material, a model of this isolation system was tested on a shaking table.  The results show an effective isolation of this method.  The motivation of studying this method is to obtain an economical isolation system.

AB Incidents of illness reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the period 1978-1987 were limited to ciguatera, scombroid fish poisoning (SFP), and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Natural intoxications are both highly regional and species associated, and toxins are present in seafood at the time of capture.
   Ciguatera is a sometimes severe disease caused by consuming certain species Of fish, usually island or reef, from tropical, subtropical, and other (temperate) waters, and was responsible for about half of all reported outbreaks to the CDC. Treatments are largely supportive, and mortality is usually low. Controls based on regulation of fishing or marketing of dangerous species, supported by testing suspect fish and educating consumers, sports fishers and health professionals, are recommended.
   SFP caused nearly the same number of outbreaks as ciguatera, but was much more widespread. Tuna, mahimahi and bluefish are implicated as the major cause of SFP. The disease is generally mild and self-resolving, and symptoms can often be ameliorated by certain antihistamine drugs.  Because the histamine poisoning is produced due to improper temperature control after the fish is caught, the disease can be prevented by rapid cooling and holding fish at low temperature(s) before cooking, as well as by not leaving the fish out too long when serving it under inadequate temperature control. A Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point-based system, and the education of subsistence and recreational/commercial fishers and cooks/servers may control this poisoning.
   Paralytic shellfish poisoning was reported to the CDC as a minor cause of illness, with only two deaths. Although "other" natural seafood intoxications (e.g., puffer fish poisoning, and neurotoxic, diarrhetic and amnesic shellfish poisoning) have not been widely reported in U.S. consumers, the potential for their occurrence either from domestic or imported seafoods from imports is real. Increased vigilance concerning imported product, testing for these "other" toxins, and procedures to deal with outbreaks are needed.

AB East Asia consists of several nations each in different stages of economic development, from developing, to newly developed, to advanced-industrial. In almost every case, the coastal zones of these nations are highly biologically productive. However, they are at the same time also vulnerable to natural hazards, with enclosed coastal waters being particularly vulnerable to pollution. In this paper, an environmental planning approach is introduced, and its application to enclosed water areas and their surrounding land areas in Japan and in China is presented.

AB This paper describes how tropical cyclones are formed and the extent of the damage that they cause, likening them to earthquakes as one of the most devastating of all natural hazards. It examines progress made in the detection, monitoring and forecasting of cyclones and concludes that more attention should be paid to mitigating their effects, notably by improving early warning systems in less developed countries.

TI RADON IN THE SURFACE WATERS OF SOUTHWEST ENGLAND AND ITS BEARING ON
   URANIUM DISTRIBUTION, FAULT AND FRACTURE SYSTEMS AND HUMAN HEALTH
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Radon is a natural radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium and thorium in rocks and soils. High surface radon concentrations are commonly associated with high levels of uranium in underlying rocks. High radon levels can also occur in groundwater, even in rocks with normal crustal uranium concentrations. The discharge of groundwater via faults and fractures can produce radon anomalies unrelated to the distribution of uranium. The surface distribution of radon is therefore influenced by the distribution of uranium and of transport pathways along faults and fractures.
   The principal radon isotope (Rn-222, half-life 3.825 days) is capable of migrating significant distances from its source, both as a gas and in solution. In the gaseous form radon can migrate into houses where, in high concentrations, it can represent a health hazard.
   The distribution of radon in streams in several areas of southwest England has been investigated. The results show a clear association of high radon levels with the uranium-enriched granite of the region, although this may simply reflect the high fracture permeability of the granite rather than its uranium enrichment with a strong influence of major fracture systems. With regard to radon as a potential health hazard, both source and transport pathways must be identified if high-risk areas are to be located. Surveys of radon in surface waters may provide a useful and speedy technique for the broad identification of such areas.

AB Riverbank slumping or erosion caused by shifting of river channels is an endemic and recurrent natural hazard in Bangladesh that displaces an estimated one million people in the country annually.  A multi-disciplinary and collaborative research between the University of Manitoba (Canada) and Jahangirnagar University (Bangladesh) was carried out in 1983-88 to investigate into the problems of river channel migration, rural population displacement and resettlement in Bangladesh.  This paper focuses upon the experience and outcomes of the collaborative project.

AB In many mountainous regions around the Mediterranean, ancient irrigation systems lead water from high level sources to meadows and cropland.  Some of these systems have remained in use over a period of 600 years or more.  They originated in rural societies and were operated by these local societies.  They were always vulnerable to natural hazards.  Now, they are under threat from social changes and also from large-scale engineering works.  In the Swiss Valais, to which attention is directed here, many of the "bisse" systems are still highly valued and in operation and, though modernized, remain under the control of the communes.  This example of adaptation to modern circumstances might well be followed elsewhere.

AB Major releases of hazardous substances into the community are a preventable cause of disaster.  Despite the impetus given by recent legislation to emergency planning the problems of mounting an adequate response to a chemical disaster are considerable.  The successful medical management of a major incident depends upon a rapid and complete evaluation of the acute and possible long-term health hazards and this is likely to require the urgent deployment to the scene of specialists from the key disciplines.  Some of the lessons of previous major incidents are highlighted; these are similar regardless of the route of human exposure (air, food and drink, water), or whether the release is from an industrial or natural source.

AB The objective of this paper is to develop statistical methods for estimating current and future numbers of individuals in different stages of the natural history of the human immunodeficiency (AIDS) virus infection and to evaluate the impact of therapeutic advances on these numbers.  The approach is to extend the method of back-calculation to allow for a multistage model of natural history and to permit the hazard functions of progression from one stage to the next to depend on calendar time.  Quasi-likelihood estimates of key quantities for evaluating health care needs can be obtained through iteratively reweighted least squares under weakly parametric models for the infection rate.  An approach is proposed for incorporating into the analysis independent estimates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence obtained from epidemiologic surveys.
   The methods are applied to the AIDS epidemic in the United States.  Short-term projections are given of both AIDS incidence and the numbers of HIV-infected AIDS-free individuals with CD4 cell depletion.  The impact of therapeutic advances on these numbers is evaluated using a change-point hazard model.  A number of important sources of uncertainty must be considered when interpreting the results, including uncertainties in the specified hazard functions of disease progression, in the parametric model for the infection rate, in the AIDS incidence data, in the efficacy of treatment, and in the proportions of HIV-infected individuals receiving treatment.

TI IMPORTANCE OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD IN UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL CHANGE
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID ERUPTIONS; AEROSOLS
AB Global changes have been happening on Earth for over 4.5 Ga, but the changes that are most consequential to society take place on timescales of decades to centuries.  Geologists, who are customarily concerned with longer term processes, have a unique contribution to make to global change studies.  The geological record is the only record of past changes, thus providing a background against which to assess anthropogenic changes.  It is also the only data base which can be used to test global models now being constructed using present observations to forecast future changes.  Geology also provides the perspective to understand the widespread consequences of global change, such as the increased hazard from landslides that results from increasing rainfall patterns.  Biotic refugia which developed as a result of past climatic change have been identified from geological studies, and better understanding of the importance of such refugia is essential to prevent the inadvertent destruction of core habitats that have remained resilient to global excursions caused by natural processes.  Most importantly, the geological record of past catastrophic events such as the K/T extinction shows how abrupt perturbations of the environment have propagated through the Earth system to modify its remote parts.

ID DYNAMO
AB Many natural phenomena can be classified as events with reasonably well defined magnitudes.  An obvious example is an earthquake where frequency-magnitude statistics fit the Guttenburg-Richter empirical correlation for both regional and world-wide data.  Another example is volcanic eruptions.  However, volcanic eruptions are more difficult to quantify in terms of magnitude.  Many meteorological events can be reasonably well quantified on a statistical basis.  Floods are one example.  It has been shown that the empirical correlation for earthquakes is in fact a fractal relation between the number of earthquakes and the linear dimension for the rupture zone.  This fractal behavior is evidence for scale-invariance since fractal statistics are the only statistics without a characteristic dimension.  Fractal statistics for the frequency-magnitude behavior of earthquakes provides a basis for estimating seismic hazards; the observed statistics for small earthquakes can be extrapolated to estimate the probability of occurrence of large earthquakes.  It is also recognized that the earth's topography generally satisfies fractal statistics.  Topography is is primarily generated by erosion but a complete mathematical theory for erosion is not available, certainly chemical and mechanical weathering play a role but the actual topography is dominated by drainage systems.  It is often hypothesized that great storms and floods dominate the formation of these systems.  Storms and floods are likely to obey to obey fractal statistics and be dominated by the largest events just as in earthquakes and volcanoes.

AB Methods of analysing and presenting longitudinal data on health characteristics that have a fluctuating course are by no means standard.  Several possibilities are discussed and tried out on longitudinal data on Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) in Dutch children.  If the purpose of a study is descriptive, a graphical presentation based on an idea from Fiellau-Nikolajsen is preferred.  For estimation purposes on the other hand, hazard functions are the most suitable.  Further reduction of the data does not lead to a clear view into the complex nature of the course of a disease such as OME.

AB Thirty-five patients with primary biliary cirrhosis were seen between 1974 and 1989.  The median mean age at presentation was 53 years (range:  30-77) and the female to male ratio was 7.8:1.  Thirteen (37%) were asymptomatic and nine (26%) had associated auto-immune disorders.  Pruritus and hepatomegaly were present in half of the patients.  Advanced histological stages of disease (Stages 3 and 4) were present in 57% of patients.  The median period of follow-up was 5 years (range:  0.1-20).  Twelve patients died, nine from hepatic causes and three from non-hepatic causes.  One has undergone liver transplantation.  A Kaplan-Meier curve estimated the median survival to be 11 years.  Asymptomatic patients developed progressive disease and survival was similar to that of symptomatic patients.  Using Cox's proportional hazards model, age, serum bilirubin and serum albumin were found to be independent prognostic variables correlating with reduced survival.

AB Two rather disparate issues, although both are stochastic in nature, arising from wind engineering are considered in this paper.  The first issue involves methods for digitally generating sample functions of a wind velocity field.  Such digital generation of sample functions is a prerequisite to successful implementation of the time and space domain analysis of wind-induced structural response.  This is particularly true within the context of Monte Carlo solutions to various problems not amenable to frequency and wave number domain analysis.  The second issue is concerned with the reliability analysis of building structures subjected to multiple natural hazards (seismic and wind in this case) within the framework of contemporary probabilistic risk assessment procedures.

TI WIND DAMAGE MITIGATION STRATEGIES FOR THE UNITED-STATES
SO JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The ASCE Task Committee on Mitigation of Severe Wind Damage completed its tasks in 1988, culminating in the publication of a committee report consisting of nine papers in the JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING.  Materials used herein are derived from the committee report with minor modifications.  It is concluded that wind damage is the most costly among all natural hazards in the United States, and the damage is increasing due to increased housing construction and lack of improvement in construction technique in wind-resistant construction.  Strategies to reduce wind damage to the nation include improvement in housing construction techniques and building codes, use insurance to provide incentives for better wind-resistant constructions, public education, technology transfer, and adequate funding for wind mitigation research.

TI EFFECT OF INDIGENOUS NATURAL-RESOURCES IN LATE RABI MAIZE PRODUCTION
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB A field investigation was carried out at Sabour during 1986-87 to 1988-89 to find out suitable and sustainable agro-technique to overcome temperature hazards faced by winter maize after preceding late rice crop.  The experiment was conducted in Randomised block design replicated four times.  The agro-technique forming the bases of 10 treatments comprised dry seed, soaking of seed in normal and warm water (50-degrees-C), which were further given additional treatment with organic mercuric fungicide (Emisan-6), and chopped rice straw in the furrow as well as mulch on the surface.  The other group of treatments, put under comparison were transplanting 30 and 60 days old seedlings of maize raised in nursery.  Maize was sown between December 21-23 with plant geometry of 60 x 20 cm in all the four seasons with standard local practices.  The soil was neutral in reaction with 0.57% organic carbon, 0.052% available N, 12.2 kg available P/ha and 163 kg available K/ha.

TI THE ORIGIN AND PATHOGENICITY OF BASIDIOBOLUS SPECIES IN NORTHERN
   AUSTRALIA
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND VETERINARY MYCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Basidiobolus haptosporus Drechsler causes human and animal disease in the tropics.  This paper reports the isolation of this organism from natural substrates and describes the pathogenicity of the isolates.  Basidiobolus was recovered from faecal samples of amphibians, reptiles and macropods, from woodlice, and from granulomatous skin lesions of horses.  Some isolates were heat-tolerant.  Almost all of the heat-tolerant isolates were pathogenic to suckling mice and had smooth or undulate, or smooth plus undulate zygospore walls.  When inoculated intracerebrally into suckling mice they caused encephalomalacia, necrosis, meningoencephalitis, congestion, haemorrhage and a granulomatous reaction in the central nervous tissue, hydrocephalus and nervous signs.  There was a variety of animal sources of pathogenic strains of the organism which were widely distributed in the sampling area, thus the potential hazard of infection could be more serious than previously considered.
