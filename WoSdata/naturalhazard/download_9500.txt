AB Since the 1940s. influenza vaccines are inactivated and purified virus or virus subunit preparations (IIV) administered by the intramuscular route. Since decades. attempts have been made to construct. as an alternative, attenuated live influenza vaccines (LIV) for intranasal administration. Presently, the most successful LIV is derived from the cold-adapted master strains A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) and B/Ann Arbor/1/66(AA-LIV, for Ann-Arbor-derived live influenza vaccine). It has been claimed that AA-LIV is more efficacious than IIV. In order to assess differences between the two vaccines with respect to systemic reactogenicity, antibody response, and efficacy, we performed a meta-analysis on eighteen randomised comparative clinical trials involving a total of 5000 vaccines of all ages. Pooled odds ratios (AA-LIV versus IIV) were calculated according to the random effects model. The two vaccines were associated with similarly low frequencies of systemic vaccine reactions (pooled odds ratio: 0.96, 95% confidence interval: 0.74-1.24). AA-LIV induced significantly lower levels of serum haemagglutination inhibiting antibody and significantly greater levels of local IgA antibody (influenza virus-specific respiratory IgA 9 assayed by ELISA in nasal wash specimens) than IIV. Yet. although they predominantly stimulate different antibody compartments, the two vaccines were similarly efficacious in preventing culture-positive influenza illness. In all trials assessing clinical efficacy. the odds ratios were not significantly different from one (point of equivalence), The pooled odds ratio for influenza A-H3N2 was 1.50 (95% CI: 0.80-2.82), and for A-H1N1, 1.03 (95% CI: 0.58-1.82). The choice between the two vaccine types should be based on weighing the advantage of the attractive non-invasive mode of administration of AA-LIV, against serious concerns about the biological risks inherent to large-scale use of infectious influenza virus. in particular the hazard of gene reassortment with non-human influenza virus strains.

AB Steep terrain and high a frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. This paper reports on the use of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical relations of landslide frequency with the physical parameters contributing to the initiation of landslides on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The horizontal travel length and the angle of reach, defined as the angle of the line connecting the head of the landslide source to the distal margin of the displaced mass, are used to describe runout behavior of landslide mass. For all landslides studied, the horizontal travel length of landslide mass ranges from 5 to 785 in, with a mean value of 43 in, and the average angle of reach is 27.7degrees. This GIS database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model for predicting slope instability. It is indicated that slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land-use are statistically significant in predicting slope instability, while slope morphology and proximity to drainage lines are not important and thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope instability. The results of this study demonstrate that slope instability can be effectively modeled by using GIS technology and logistic multiple regression analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE waiting time distribution; competing risks analyses
ID NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; CENSORED-DATA
AB We provide non-parametric estimates of the marginal cumulative distribution of stage occupation times (waiting times) and non-parametric estimates of marginal cumulative incidence function (proportion of persons who leave stage j for stage j' within time t of entering stage j) using right-censored data from a multi-stage model. We allow for stage and path dependent censoring where the censoring hazard for an individual may depend on his or her natural covariate history such as the collection of stages visited before the current stage and their occupation times. Additional external time dependent covariates that may induce dependent censoring can also be incorporated into our estimates, if available. Our approach requires modelling the censoring hazard so that an estimate of the integrated censoring hazard can be used in constructing the estimates of the waiting times distributions. For this purpose, we propose the use of an additive hazard model which results in very flexible (robust) estimates. Examples based on data from burn patients and simulated data with tracking are also provided to demonstrate the performance of our estimators.

AB Activated carbons present very low thermal conductivity (0.2 W m(-1) K-1) responsible for severe thermal limitations inducing low overall adsorption and desorption kinetics as well as secondary reaction products or hazards in industrial applications. The in situ activation of various precursors within a consolidated expanded natural graphite matrix led to composites of high thermal conductivities (from 1 to 32 W m(-1) K-1) and high effective adsorbent level (80 wt.%). Preparation protocols adapted to the different precursors and activation agents are proposed and a wide range of microporous characteristics (from molecular sieve to super-adsorbent) was obtained.

AB The use of depleted uranium (DU, U-238) as ammunition is currently a major topic for discussion. DU is the main by-product from the processing of nuclear fuel (U-235). It is considered to be less radioactive than natural uranium, but despite this, there is still a serious hazard due to the alpha-radiation that is emitted. U like other heavy metals is a threat to both health and the environment because of its pronounced toxicity. Significant amounts of uranium have been released in the last decade with armor piercing ammunition that was manufactured from DU, not only during major conflicts but also on numerous military shooting ranges all over the world.
   The paper describes methods for the extraction of plant available DU from soils, digestion processes for plant material and the determination of U-238 by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (ICP-QMS) in soils, plants and waters.

AB Drill cuttings generated during borehole excavation have been routinely dumped into the North Sea, where they now represent a significant environmental hazard owing to contamination by oil residues and heavy metals. In-situ measurements of the structure of drill-cutting piles are relatively poor owing to the difficulty of accessing water depths of 60-180 m. In an effort to understand how drill-cutting piles are formed, laboratory-scale experiments were undertaken to investigate how granular material, poured into a tank of water, spreads along a rigid horizontal wall. The laboratory study examined how the pile radius varied as a function of particle size (90 hem to 3 mm), source height above the wall, particle volume flux and volume deposited. A model of drill-cutting pile formation is developed by combining descriptions of descent as a plume and propagation along the wall as a gravity current. Satisfactory agreement is obtained between experimental measurements and model predictions, which are applied to interpret available field data. The implications of this research for drill-cutting pile remediation are discussed. The model indicates that when natural bioremediation has broken down a 5-cm layer of a drill-cutting pile, only 50-100% of the pile area (or 75-95% of the pile volume) requires treatment.

ID ERROR
AB The research examines the incompatibility between resolution and scale of spatial data in a spatial modelling environment and the resolution and scale of human spatial decision-making. This incompatibility is rarely considered when a geographic information systems (GIS) is applied to natural hazard risk assessment. However, the ultimate success of a risk management project should be assessed in the context of improved decision-making. Decision Utility is an emerging theme in GIS literature that focuses on cognitive issues of GIS and human interactions. The research presents a technique for flood risk modelling using GIS and digital elevation models to map relative risk in urban communities. The study is based on Cairns located in far northern Australia. The risk model accounts for uncertainties inherent in the elevation data by adapting an existing error simulation technique. Techniques for making spatial model assumptions and model error explicit to flood risk managers are introduced and evaluated for risk management decision-making. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Phenol, cresols, dimethylphenols and resorcinols are considered major pollutants in the oil-shale semi-coke dump leachates (up to 380 mg phenols/L) that contaminate the surrounding soils and pose a threat to the groundwater in the North-East of Estonia. However, despite high residual concentrations of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oil products in these soils, the concentration of phenols (especially their water-extractable fraction) was low, not exceeding 0.7 mg/kg dwt. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of biodegradation and aging on the decrease of hazard caused by phenolic pollution. The extractability of phenols (phenol, cresols, dimethylphenols and resorcinols) and their biodegradability by the microbial population was studied in the 13 soils sampled from the Estonian oil-shale region, territories of former gas stations, and from presumably non-polluted areas. Phenol, 5-methylresorcinol, p-cresol and resorcinol could be considered easily degradable in the soils as' the microbial populations from majority of the soils studied were able to grow on mineral medium supplemented with these phenols as a single source of carbon. 2,3- and 2,4- and 3,4-dimethylphenols could be considered less easily biodegradable.
   The semi-coke dump leachate polluted soil (containing no dibasic phenols, 43 mg of monobasic phenols, 1348 mg of oil products and 35 mg of PAHs per g dwt) was analyzed chemically (HPLC) and toxicologically (Flash-Assay using Vibrio fischeri) for the leaching of phenols during shaking of soil-water slurries for 24 h. Only 5.8% of the total concentration of phenols was water-extractable, whereas about 50% of the leached amount was biodegraded by the soil microorganisms. Phenol and cresols were biodegraded by 80%, but the concentration of dimethylphenols practically did not change. The pollutants (measured as total water-extractable toxicity) were desorbed from the soil particles by the 8th h of extraction, whereas the toxicity of the aqueous phase continued to increase, probably due to the formation of toxic metabolites. The concentration of water-extractable phenols was too low to explain the toxicity of the extract. Also the impact of PAHs and oil products was excluded. Thus, the relatively low concentration of phenols in the oil-shale region soils is most probably the reflection of both natural attenuation and pollution aging. Therefore, the impact of phenolic compounds to the net bioavailable hazard is probably not so remarkable as it has been considered. The actual pollutants causing the toxicity of the soils from the oil-shale region, however, need to be elucidated.

AB The fresh latex of cultivated E. resinifera Berg. is a convenient source of the ultrapotent vanilloid resiniferatoxin, and a transesterification-reesterification procedure that substantially alleviates the hazards associated with the direct isolation of this obnoxious diterpenoid has been developed. Various known phorboid constituents of the diterpenoid fraction were obtained in pure form and have been spectroscopically characterized for the first time, while the non-diterpenoid fraction of the latex gave, besides some common triterpenoids, three new bisnorsesquiterpenes of the dihydroionol type. The structures of these compounds were established through a combination of spectroscopic data and chemical reactions.

ID CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT; MOUNTAINS; PERMAFROST; SCOTLAND; CLIMATE;
   HAZARDS
AB Montane (alpine) areas are generally of high value for nature conservation. Such environments and the habitats they support are dynamic and often fragile. They are vulnerable to disturbance from a range of human activities and are responsive to climate changes over short and long timescales. Biodiversity and conservation values are closely linked to geological history, geomorphological processes and soils, and it is crucial that management systems are based on understanding these links.
   There are many similarities between the Cairngorm Mountains (Scotland), the Giant Mountains (Czech Republic) and Abisko Mountains (Sweden) in terms of geology, geomorphology, ecology, links with biodiversity and high conservation importance. Comparable pressures and management issues involve, to varying degrees, a history of human use and impacts from deforestation, pasturing, grazing, recreation and atmospheric pollution. Landscape change therefore involves a complex interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors. Managing such change requires better understanding of the geo-ecological processes involved and the factors that determine landscape sensitivity. This is illustrated through a simple framework and examples from the three areas. Comparison of landscape sensitivity between similar montane areas, but in different geographic locations and climatic environments, should allow more informed management planning and a precautionary approach in advance of further changes in human activity and from predicted global warming scenarios.

AB Forty-two representative rock samples used for construction purpose were collected from the quarries and outcrops of the rock units forming the Shewa-Shahbaz Garhi igneous complex, North-West Pakistan. Radioactivity of terrestrial radionuclides (U-238, Th-232, and K-40) was measured in these samples using gamma ray spectrometry system with an HPGe detector. The samples showed fairly high mean concentrations of 51 +/- 16 Bq kg(-1) of U-238, 70 +/- 20 Bq kg(-1) of Th-232 and 1,272 +/- 367 Bq kg(-1) of K-40. Mean absorbed gamma dose rate in air of 119 +/- 29 nGy h(-1) was found. Assessment of radiological hazards was made by calculating radium equivalent activities with external and internal hazard indices. The calculations showed radium equivalent activity ranging from 52 to 346 Bq kg(-1). External and internal hazard indices ranging from 0.14 to 0.94 and 0.17 to 1.1, respectively, were found.

   hand-baiting control of plains pocket gophers
SO INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
LA English

DE safe efficacy; strychnine; hand-baiting; pocket gophers
AB In November 1990, field efficacy studies using milo baits formulated with 0.35%, 0.75%, or 1.30% strychnine alkaloid were compared to a placebo (0.0% strychnine) for controlling plains pocket gophers (Geomys bursaries) near Pleasanton, Texas. These data were required by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as partial fulfillment for the maintenance of the rodenticide registrations of the US Department of Agriculture. Each of four treatment units (TUs) within a block (2) was randomly assigned one of the four baits. Within each TU, 15 gophers were captured (balanced roughly for gender) and instrumented with radio transmitters. Following a pretreatment acclimation averaging 4.1 days, bait (4 g) was placed in active pocket gopher burrows by hand-baiting. Pocket gopher mortality was measured by monitoring the fate of radio-equipped pocket gophers (n = 123) both pretreatment and posttreatment. Lack of gopher movement on two consecutive days indicated death, and the carcass was retrieved. Strychnine mortality was based on chemical analyses of carcasses, and it occurred in 0.0%, 66.7%, 96.3%, and 89.7% of gophers from the 0.0%, 0.35%, 0.75% and 1.30% TUs, respectively. Natural mortality was 7% on the placebo TUs. All three strychnine treatments provided significantly increased mortality over the placebo (P < 0.0001) using Fisher's exact test for paired comparisons. A difference in gopher mortality occurred between the 0.32% and 0.77% strychnine treatments (P = 0.003), but not between the other comparisons (0.32% vs 1.30%, P = 0.18 and 0.77% vs. 1.30%, P = 0.24). Gopher carcasses recovered posttreatment indicated 68 of 86 (79.1%) had strychnine alkaloid residues. The non-target strychnine hazard (using least-squares means) by treatment were 4.85 ppm (0.35%), 8.04 ppm (0.75%), and 9.47 ppm (1.30%). Carcass residue differences were not detected among strychnine treatments (F = 2.48, df = 2, 3, P = 0.23). Fortunately, non-target exposure was greatly decreased because all carcasses with strychnine residues were recovered underground at a mean depth of 0.51 m (SE = 0.027, range 0.15-1.17 m). Placebo-baited TUs had 27 survivors and 2 deaths from unknown causes. None had detectable strychnine levels. No non-target mortalities were documented during carcass searches and radio-tracking activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the increasing availability of remotely sensed data and census data, discussing their relationship is one of the important issues in GIS data integration. This paper proposed an approach to linking three levels (macro, medium and micro) of land classifications with areal census data on hierarchical census boundaries. Specifically, a method of building the correlations between areal census dwelling data and residential densities classified by a remote sensing approach was demonstrated. First, a texture statistic (homogeneity) along with six Thematic Mapper (TM) bands (bands 1-5 and 7) was put together to classify residential density levels. The homogeneity slightly enhanced classification accuracy. Then, to test the correlations between census dwelling data and residential densities, a multiple linear regression was conducted. It was found that areal census dwelling data had higher correlations with areas of different residential densities than with the aggregated area of a whole residential area at an individual census zone level. Finally, the paper discussed that dis-aggregation of areal census data based on dwelling densities within the framework of remote sensing and GIS would be very useful for multidisciplinary studies, such as natural hazards risk assessment.

   development of industrial growth centres in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

   mapping; siting; planning
AB 'Environmental risk minimization' is a major issue of cleaner production objectives. Cleaner production is a concept that goes beyond simple Pollution control and hence. its objectives cannot be ensured unless (a) risks of environmental threats (accidental chemical reactions. release of hazardous gases/contamination. and/or liquids/untreated effluents. etc.) triggered by a probable technological mishap or a natural calamity and (b) existing background level of pollution/contamination and ecological sensitivity are taken into account while selecting a suitable site for developing an industrial complex. Development of industrial growth centres (IGCs) has been initiated in India to accommodate a range of small and medium scale industries that Lire the major contributors to the economics in developing countries. Selection of safer sites for IGCs, thus, has become a serious concern because of synchronous activities. synergistic pollution effects and risks of accidental releases and discharges.
   The paper discusses the adverse effects of potential interaction between natural risk factors and industrial systems. highlights regional risk management issues and the role of proper site selection in establishing IGCs. Reviewing the current efforts of industrial siting and developemental planning, a new, tool 'environmental risk mapping' to guide the planning process regarding the development of IGCs has been proposed and its operational framework has been delineated. Further planning issues for suggested IGC sites and the role of the proposed approach in regional environmental impact assessment and environmental management planning have also been analyzed while summarizing the expected benefits over the current practices. Although the proposed approach has been developed for application in India, its, Usefulness can be claimed in many developing countries as there predominates a diversity of geophysiographic features. as well Lis regional proneness to many natural and technological hazards.

AB Phosphate rock samples collected from the Dange Formation within the Sokoto basin were analyzed for trace element constituents using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRFA) techniques, while natural activity concentrations due to (238)U, (232)Th, and (40)K were determined by gamma-ray spectrometry. The analytical results show that the average concentrations of some toxic elements (As, Sb, Cr, and Zn) in phosphate rocks are not appreciably different from that in agricultural soils. However the U and Th contents are enriched significantly in comparison. The results were used to assess the environmental toxicity of heavy metals and radiation hazard attributable to the direct application of phosphate rock as fertilizer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Radioactivity in some Tunisian thermo-mineral springs (11 hot mineral springs and one cold spring) has been determined for the first time in Tunisia using radiochemical separation procedures. The obtained results show that U-238 activity concentrations vary between 1.5 and about 43 mBq/l. The measured activities of U-234 and Ra-226 range from 1.1 to about 82.2 mBq/l and 34-3900 mBq/l, respectively. The radioactive disequilibria in these waters are in excess of concentration of U-234 compared to that of U-238. The Ra-226/U-234 activity ratios are high and in the range of 9.0-691.0. U. Th and Ra activities are similar to those published for other non-polluted regions of the world. Radioactivity in the only cold mineral water from Ain Oktor is very low, and thus health hazards due to the consumption of this water are not expected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The natural radioactivity of Ra-226 and Ra-228 in scale samples taken from pipes used in 2 several local water wells,vas investigated. The results showed Ra-226 activities to be varying from 1284 to 3613 Bq/kg whereas. the Ra-228 concentrations did not show any significant variation, all being low, below 30 Bq/kg. The Rn-222 exhalations from these scale samples were also measured and compared with the Ra-226 contents. The average ratio of Rn-222/Ra-226 was 31%. Chemical analyses showed that the main constituent of the scale samples was iron. The radiation dose rates from the pipes and scale were up to 100 nSv/h. Although not a major hazard this could present a long-term risk if the scale materials were handled indiscriminately. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The radioactivity of U-238, Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 and Cs-137 in sediments, soil, turf and honey from Serbia and Kosovo (Yugoslavia) was measured using gamma and alpha spectrometry in order to estimate the radiation hazard from natural and man-made sources, as well as to compile a database for radioactivity levels in those regions. One sample, collected in the vicinity of a "depleted uranium" (DU) shell of the recent Balkan war, revealed a high U-238 activity and a non-natural U-235/U-238 activity ratio, confirming therefore its anthropogenic origin. However, some other soil samples coming from characteristic DU craters did not show any characteristic level of radioactivity. The other sediment and turf samples taken all around the country show low radioactivity levels for all the isotopes here considered. With the aim of obtaining some indication about radioactivity migration in the food chain, several honey samples have been examined too. All samples show very low radioactivity content, often indistinguishable from natural background. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The activity concentrations of natural gamma-emitting radionuclides and associated radiation hazards due to K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 have been measured in baked brick samples, collected from six highly populated areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. For the detection, analysis and data acquisition, a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector coupled with a high resolution multichannel analyser (MCA) was used. The range of the average values of the activity concentrations due to K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 were found to be 680.3 +/- 22.2-784.4 +/- 30.7 Bq kg(-1), 36.9 +/-3.5-51.9 +/-3.3 Bq kg(-1) and 52.5 +/-3.6-67.6 +/-3.1 Bq kg(-1) respectively. Radium equivalent (Ra-eq) activities and various hazard indices were also calculated to assess the radiation hazards. All the brick samples showed Ra-eq activities within the limit (370 Bq kg(-1)) set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The results of different criterion formulae also complemented each other in this study. The derived data have been compared with the reported values for other countries of the world.

AB Here we review some of the main processes and key parameters affecting the mobility of radiocesium in soils of semi-natural areas. We further illustrate them in a collection of soil surface horizons which largely differ in their organic matter contents. In soils, specific retention of radiocesium occurs in a very small number of sorbing sites, which are the frayed edge sites (FES) born out or weathered micaceous minerals. The FES abundance directly governs the mobility of trace Cs in the rhizosphere and thus its transfer from soil to plant. Here, we show that the accumulation of organic matter in topsoils can exert a dilution of FES-bearing minerals in the thick humus of some forest soils. Consequently, such accumulation significantly contributes to increasing Cs-137 soil-to-plant transfer. Potassium depletion and extensive exploration of [tie organic horizons by plant roots can further enhance the contamination hazard, As humus thickness depends on both ecological conditions and forest management, our observations support the following ideas: (1) forest ecosystems can be classified according to their sensitivity to radiocesium bio-recycling, (2) specific forest management Could be searched to decrease such bio-recycling.

AB We develop Bayesian methods for right censored multivariate failure time data for populations with a cure fraction, We propose a new model, called the multivariate cure rate model, and provide a natural motivation and interpretation of it. To create the correlation structure between the failure times, we introduce a frailty term, which is assumed to have a positive stable distribution. The resulting correlation structure induced by the frailty term is quite appealing and leads to a nice characterization of the association between the failure times. Several novel properties of the model are derived. First, conditional on the frailty term, it is shown that the model has a proportional hazards structure with the covariates depending naturally on the cure rate. Second, we establish mathematical relationships between the marginal Survivor functions of the multivariate cure rate model and the more standard mixture model for modelling cure rates. With the introduction of latent variables, we show that the new model is computationally appealing, and novel computational Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are developed to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Specifically, we propose a modified version of the collapsed Gibbs technique (J.S. Liu, 1994, J. Amer. Statist Assoc. 89, 958-966) to sample from the posterior distribution. This development will lead to an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure, which would otherwise be extremely difficult. We characterize the propriety of the joint posterior distribution of the parameters using a class of noninformative improper priors. A real dataset from a melanoma clinical trial is presented to illustrate the methodology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science.

AB This study examined age differences in risk judgments and perceptions of invulnerability by surveying 577 adolescents (grades 5, 7, and 9) and young adults (ages 20 to 30 years) for their judgments concerning natural hazards and behavior-linked risks. Adolescents were less likely than were young adults to see themselves as invulnerable, and only a small minority of adolescents evidenced such perceptions. Moreover, individuals' perceptions about the magnitude of their personal risk for experiencing negative outcomes showed an inverse relation to age. Most participants were inaccurate and significantly overestimated risks; this was especially true of adolescents. These patterns of age differences were consistent across different types of risks and sociodemographic configurations. The results pose a challenge to conventional wisdom concerning adolescents' perceptions of risk and have important implications for theory, programs, and policies related to adolescents.

AB Recent trends in building construction have highlighted the need for improved methodologies for engineering new light-frame structures for housing and techniques for condition assessment of existing structures, The aftermath of natural disasters during the past decade, the rapid evolution of design and construction methods, and heightened expectations on the part of the public and its scrutiny of perceived and actual deficiencies in codes and code enforcement have further underscored these needs, Among the high-priority areas identified, at a 1997 ASCE workshop on wood engineering research needs were behavior and performance of wood structural systems; criteria for performance assessment; and methods for condition assessment of damaged systems following natural disasters. The development of appropriate and usable fragility models and system reliability analysis tools is necessary to meet these needs and to make meaningful advances in performance-based engineering of wood frame structures. This paper provides an overview of efforts to develop such models and tools, and suggests a possible methodology for assessing probable response of light-frame residential construction exposed to various levels of natural and man-made hazards. The implementation of performance-based engineering for residential construction will enhance durability and reduce maintenance costs of the nation's housing inventory, and will facilitate reductions in risk of death, injury, and property damage from extreme natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes.

AB Purpose. There have been few studies of the natural history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and none have used serial noninvasive laboratory examinations for the objective quantification of disease progression. The relationship between the site of initial symptoms of PAD (lower-extremity disease [LED] vs cerebrovascular disease [CVD]) and the. P site of subsequent symptomatic progression (LED vs CVD vs coronary heart disease [CHD]) has not been examined.
   Methods. This is a long-term, blinded prospective clinical research study of the relationship of PAD progression to multiple clinical, laboratory, and noninvasive vascular laboratory parameters. Patients with symptomatic LED, CVD, or both underwent comprehensive risk-factor assessment and were seen every 6 months for follow-up examinations. In addition to history and physical examination, all subjects underwent serial noninvasive lower-extremity and carotid artery testing. The relationship between the initial symptomatic site(s) and subsequent progression was examined by means of multivariate proportional hazards analysis, which was adjusted for age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, homocysteine level, lowest initial ankle/brachial index (ABI), worst carotid stenosis, ABI progression, and carotid stenosis progression, because each of these factors was significantly associated with one or more aspects of progression.
   Results.-There were 397 study subjects (mean age, 66 years; 38% women),with a mean follow-up period of 48.5 months. LED was initially present in 88% of subjects and CVD in 37% of subjects (both were present in 25% of subjects). There were 78 deaths, 47 (60%) of which were caused by cardiovascular disease (18% mortality rate after 5 years by means of life table). Progression of disease as documented by means of vascular laboratory findings occurred in 90% of subjects by means of life table after 5 years (ABI progression, 31%; carotid stenosis progression, 40%). Symptomatic clinical progression of disease occurred in 52% of subjects by means of life table after 5 years (LED progression, 22%; CVD progression, 23%; CHD progression, 31%). By means of multivariate analysis, no significant relationship was found between the site of initial symptoms of PAD and the site(s) of subsequent symptomatic clinical progression (LED vs CVD vs CHD; P = not significant for all hazard ratios).
   Conclusion: Patients with symptomatic PAD experience symptoms of ongoing LED, CVD, and CHD with a frequency that is not influenced by the site(s) of their original symptoms. The hypothesis that lesions and resulting symptoms of systemic atherosclerosis occur at various anatomic sites as a matter of random chance should be tested with other studies.

ID FRENCH ALPS; DEBRIS FLOW
AB One of the major problems of the efficient synergetic use of remote sensing data for natural disaster mitigation is the fusion of various meteo- and geodata sets of significantly different spatial resolution. On the other hand, different morphological types of mass movements are based on alternate concepts i.e. of generation which, again has to be initially reflected in differing methodological approaches. The unifying idea and stronghold, however, of the presented approach is the precipitation parameters which trigger the debris flows. Albeit, frequently there are no relevant precipitation climatic data available. Despite significant drawbacks in the integration of Landsat and/or SPOT data sound hazard zonation maps can be generated. For a test area in the French Alps it has been shown that remote sensing data can be used to predict potential debris flow events. High temporal frequency remote sensing data from the Meteosat series of satellites allow the identification of cloud clusters most likely to result in intense rainfall which are, in turn, likely to initiate debris flow activity. Video evidence, field observations and an empirical debris flow model linked to an instantaneous rain gauge were used to ascertain the exact times of debris flow initiation. Due to the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in mountainous regions and the large areas vulnerable to debris flows compared to the coverages of these observations, there are, however, restrictions on the use of these data for large regions to provide early warning of debris flow events operationally. Additionally, the possible timeliness of warnings using such observations is restricted to the relatively short interval between the onset of the triggering phenomena and the hazard event. The remote sensing techniques developed in this study, allow warning of potential debris flow events to be derived before the triggering phenomenon occurs, by attempting to recognise the evolution if intense rain-bearing clouds. In this role the meteorological remote sensing data are not used to retrieve rainfall amounts but, instead, to derive rain cloud properties that produce debris flow triggering conditions.

TI Probabilistic approach to rock fall hazard assessment: potential of

SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

DT Article
AB We study the rock fall volume distribution for three rock fall inventories and we fit the observed data by a power-law distribution, which has recently been proposed to describe landslide and rock fall volume distributions, and is also observed for many other natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. We use these statistical distributions of past events to estimate rock fall occurrence rates on the studied areas. It is an alternative to deterministic approaches, which have not proved successful in predicting individual rock falls. The first one concerns calcareous cliffs around Grenoble, French Alps, from 1935 to 1995. The second data set is gathered during the 1912-1992 time window in Yosemite Valley, USA, in granite cliffs. The third one covers the 1954-1976 period in the Arly gorges, French Alps, with metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
   For the three data sets, we find a good agreement between the observed volume distributions and a fit by a power-law distribution for volumes larger than 50m(3), or 20m(3) for the Arly gorges. We obtain similar values of the b exponent close to 0.45 for the 3 data sets. In agreement with previous studies, this suggests, that the b value is not dependant on the geological settings. Regarding the rate of rock fall activity, determined as the number of rock fall events with volume larger than 1m(3) per year, we find a large variability from one site to the other. The rock fall activity, as part of a local erosion rate, is thus spatially dependent.
   We discuss the implications of these observations for the rock fall hazard evaluation. First, assuming that the volume distributions are temporally stable, a complete rock fall inventory allows for the prediction of recurrence rates for future events of a given volume in the range of the observed historical data. Second, assuming that the observed volume distribution follows a power-law distribution without cutoff at small or large scales, we can extrapolate these predictions to events smaller or larger than those reported in the data sets. Finally, we discuss the possible biases induced by the poor quality of the rock fall inventories, and the sensibility of the extrapolated predictions to variations in the parameters of the power law.

AB The Paper presents the regional perspective on the conditions and efforts for the integrated coastal management (ICM) that exist in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR).
   The Caribbean Action Plan was adopted in 1981 with an initial workplan of activities of evaluation and control of marine pollution, evaluation of impacts on the coastal area, fishing studies, watershed management, evaluation of natural hazard effects, energy accounting systems studies, urbanisation of the coastal area, building capacity and training. The Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the WCR is the only regional legal framework for the protection and sustainable development of marine resources.
   The Paper describes some region-wide ICM-related programme initiated or supported by the CEP as well as actions at the national level. Other ICM-related general activities and training programmes of CEP are also presented.
   Trends in national policies in ICM and current developments and issues are also highlighted and recommendations made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The necessity of catastrophe modeling is stipulated both by the essential increase of losses due to recent natural and anthropogenic hazards and by the lack of reliable empirical data. This paper focuses on modeling risks due to earthquakes. The block model as an example of approach to mathematical modeling of lithosphere dynamics is described. Algorithms for simulating the dynamics of block structures are presented and simulation results for the selected tectonic region are discussed; in the design of the algorithms, parallel computer technologies are employed.

AB Drought is one of the major natural hazards affecting the environment and economy of countries worldwide, Reliance on weather data alone is not sufficient to monitor areas of drought, particularly when these data can be untimely, sparse, and incomplete. Augmenting weather data with satellite images to identify the location and severity of droughts is a must for complete, up-to-date, and comprehensive coverage of current drought conditions, The objective of this research was to standardize, by time of year, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to augment drought-monitoring techniques. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) describes the probability of vegetation condition deviation from "normal," based on calculations from weekly NDVI values, The study was conducted with 12 years (1989-2000) of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images. Z-scores of the NDVI distribution are used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the present vegetation condition at a given location relative to the possible range of vegetative vigor, historically. The SVI can be interpreted as vegetation condition based on the fact that vegetation is an efficient integrator of climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the boundary layer of the atmosphere. It thereby provides a spatially and temporally continuous short-term indicator of climatic conditions. Findings indicate that the SVI, along with other drought monitoring tools, is useful for assessing the extent and severity of drought at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The SVI is capable of providing a near-real-time indicator of vegetation condition within drought regions, and more specifically areas of varying drought conditions.

AB Simplicity is at the heart of the observational method. Its basis is straightforward and it is an inherently natural approach to address uncertainty. The focus on prediction, monitoring, feedback, and teamwork also creates a strong opportunity for learning. Applications typically involve underground construction and temporary works. The objectives are to save cost or time while maintaining an acceptable level of safety. Application of the method was pioneered by Terzaghi and the principles were formally set down by Peck in his 1969 Rankine lecture. Possible modes of failure must be carefully assessed and controlled, particularly those of a sudden or brittle nature, or those that could lead to progressive collapse. Safety is essential and a high degree of certainty in project performance and schedule is generally required. The observational method overcomes the limitations of conventional design by evaluating feedback from actual conditions. This paper describes how simple measurements were central to resolving complexity and controlling risk. It presents three recent case histories featuring the 'progressive modification' approach which removed barriers that may have prevented the opportunity to apply the observational method.

AB A compilation of 16 cases of reservoir-induced seismicity in Brazil is presented with maximum magnitudes ranging from 1.6 M-L to 4.2 m(b). The compilation includes: location of the main epicentral area with respect to the reservoir (inside the lake, at the margin, or outside), predominant geology, and the temporal distribution of the main phase(s) of activity (initial or delayed in relation to impoundment). Data on the regional stress field for some reservoirs is also included. Four recent cases are discussed in more detail: Tucurui, Nova Ponte, Miranda, and Serra da Mesa. A comparison with all other reservoirs deeper than 30 m and 50 m suggests that the hazard for induced-seismicity varies within Brazil: the NE part of the intracratonic Parana basin has higher hazard as compared with the southern part of the same basin. No correlation of the induced hazard with variations in natural seismicity can be observed.

AB Depleted uranium (DU) is a dense heavy metal used primarily, it) military applications. Published data front our laboratory have demonstrated that DU exposure in vitro to immortalised human osteoblast cells (HOS) is both neoplastically transforming and genotoxic. DU possesses both a radiological (alpha-particle) and chemical metal) component. Since DU has a low specific activity in comparison to natural uranium, it is not considered to be a significant radiological hazard. The potential contribution of radiation to DU-induced biological effects is unknown and the involvement of radiation in DU-induced biological effects could have significant implications for current risk estimates for internalised DU exposure. Two approaches were used to address this question. The frequency of dicentrics was measured in HOS cells following DU exposure in vitro. Data demonstrated that DU exposure (50 muM. 24 h) induced a significant elevation in dicentric frequency in vitro in contrast to incubution with the heavy metals, nickel and tungsten which did not increase dicentric frequency above background levels. Using the same concentration (50 muM) of three Uranyl nitrate compounds that have different uranium isotopic concentrations and therefore. different specific activities. the effect on neoplastic transformation in vitro was examined. HOS cells were exposed to one of three-uranyl nitrate compounds (U-238-uranyl nitrate, specific activity 0,33 muCi.g(-1) DU-uranyl nitrate, specific activity 0.44 muCi.g(-1) and U-235-uranyl nitrate, specific activity muCi.g(-1)) delivered at a concentration of 50 muM for 24 K Results showed, at equal uranium concentration, there was a specific activity dependent increase in reoplastic transformation frequency. Taken together these data suggest that radiation can play a role in DU-induced biological effects in vitro.

AB The activity concentrations of naturally occurring radioactive materials in soil samples from an elevated radiation background area of three northern districts of Bangladesh were determined using gamma ray spectrometry. The outdoor and indoor external effective dose rates and the radiation hazard indices from these soil activities were evaluated, The dose rates were found to be about four times higher than the reported world average value. The concentration of natural radionuclides, derived radium equivalent activities and the representative level indices were also found to be higher. Recommendations on radiolocical and dosimetric measures have been suggested with an aim of minimising the harmful effects of ionising radiation to the population of the area concerned.

AB A balloon trajectory control system is discussed that is under development for use on NASA's Ultra Long Duration Balloon Project. The trajectory control system exploits the natural wind field variation with altitude to generate passive lateral control forces on a balloon using a tether-deployed aerodynamic surface below the balloon. A lifting device, such as a wing on end, is suspended on a tether well beneath the balloon to take advantage of this variation in wind velocity with altitude. The wing generates a horizontal lift force that can be directed over a wide range of angles. This force, transmitted to the balloon by a tether, alters the balloon's path providing a bias velocity of a few meters per second to the balloon drift rate. The trajectory control system enables the balloon to avoid hazards, reach targets, steer around avoidance countries and select convenient landing zones. No longer will balloons be totally at the mercy of the winds. Tests in April 1999 of a dynamically-scaled model of the trajectory control system were carried out by Global Aerospace Corporation in ground level winds up to 15 m/s. The size of the scale model was designed to simulate the behavior of the full scale trajectory control system operating at 20 kin altitude. The model confirmed many aspects of trajectory control system performance and the results will be incorporated into future development. (C) 2002 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Load duration behavior, arising from creep-rupture, is one of the most significant effects distinguishing wood materials from other structural materials. The phenomenon of creep-rupture has been widely studied over the past two decades. Recent experimental programs have focused on duration-of-load (DOL) effects in full-size lumber and a number of different cumulative damage models have been proposed. These models have been used in reliability analyses that take into account the stochastic nature of the loading process to evaluate appropriate load duration adjustment factors for use in design. More recently, the stochastic damage accumulation process itself has been investigated. This has resulted in proposals for simplified cumulative damage analyses and the re-emergence of the 'killer pulse' concept for load duration effects in wood. Other recent studies have focused on evaluating analogous load-time effects in mechanical connections in wood. While the mechanisms in connections are recognized as different from those in wood members, the treatment of time effects in design are (at least at the present time) similar. With the tendency toward engineered design of wood structures subject to natural hazards loadings, such as wind and seismic loads, load duration effects in both the primary framing members and the structural connections may be of particular importance. The evolution of the new LRFD standard for wood provides a good opportunity to re-visit this important issue. This paper will briefly review DOL research, with particular emphasis on the work used as the basis for the time effects factors in the LRFD standard, and describe some recent work in (a) a simplified approach to cumulative damage analysis using order statistics, and (b) load-time effects in simple wood connections. It is shown that reliability analyses including DOL behavior can be performed more simply (efficiently) using an order statistics approach or even a simple FORM analysis. Thus, it may be possible to evaluate load duration factors for design without having to perform complex stochastic cumulative damage analyses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Moderate to strong crustal earthquakes are generally accompanied by a distinctive pattern of coseismic geological phenomena, ranging from surface faulting to ground cracks, landslides, liquefaction/compaction, which leave a permanent mark in the landscape. Therefore, the repetition of surface faulting earthquakes over a geologic time interval determines a characteristic morphology closely related to seismic potential. To support this statement, the areal distribution and dimensions of effects of recent historical earthquakes in the Southern Apennines are being investigated in detail. This paper presents results concerning the 26 July 1805 earthquake in the Molise region, (I = X MCS, M = 6.8), and the 23 November 1980 earthquake in the Campania and Basilicata regions (I = X MSK, M-s = 6.9). Landslide data are also compared with two other historical earthquakes in the same region with similar macroseismic intensity. The number of significant effects (either ground deformation or hydrological anomalies) versus their minimum distance from the causative fault have been statistically analyzed, finding characteristic relationships. In particular, the decay of the number of landslides with distance from fault follows an exponential law, whereas it shows almost a rectilinear trend for liquefaction and hydrological anomalies. Most effects fall within the macroseismic area, landslides within intensity V to VI, liquefaction effects within VI and hydrological anomalies within IV MCS/MSK, hence at much larger distances. A possible correlation between maximum distance of effects and length of the reactivated fault zone is also noted. Maximum distances fit the envelope curves for Intensity and Magnitude based on worldwide data. These results suggest that a careful examination of coseismic geological effects can be important for a proper estimation of earthquake parameters and vulnerability of the natural environment for seismic hazard evaluation purposes.

ID RAT
AB One of the most important quantitative outputs from toxicity studies is identification of the highest exposure level (dose or concentration) that does not cause treatment related effects that could be considered relevant to human health risk assessment. A review of regulatory and other scientific literature and of current practices has revealed a lack of consistency in definition and application of frequently used terms such as No Observed Effect Level (NOEL), No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), adverse effect, biologically significant effect, or toxicologically significant effect. Moreover, no coherent criteria were found that could be used to guide consistent interpretation of toxicity studies, including the recognition and differentiation between adverse and nonadverse effects. This presentation will address these issues identified first by proposing a standard set of definitions for key terms such as NOEL and NOAEL that are frequently used to describe the overall outcome of a toxicity study. Second, a coherent framework is outlined that can assist the toxicologist in arriving at consistent study interpretation. This structured process involves two main steps. In the first, the toxicologist must decide whether differences from control values are treatment related or if they are chance deviations. In the second step, only those differences judged to be effects are further evaluated in order to discriminate between those that are adverse and those that are not. For each step, criteria are described that can be used to make consistent judgments. In differentiating an effect from a chance finding, consideration is given inter alia to dose response, spurious measurements in individual parameters, the precision of the measurement under evaluation, ranges of natural variation and the overall biological plausibility of the observation. In discriminating between the adverse and the non-adverse effect consideration is given to: whether the effect is an adaptive response, whether it is transient, the magnitude of the effect, its association with effects in other related endpoints, whether it is a precursor to a more significant effect, whether it has an effect on the overall function of the organism, whether it is a specific effect on an organ or organ system or secondary to general toxicity or whether the effect is a predictable consequence of the experimental model. In interpreting complex studies it is recognised that a weight of the evidence approach, combining the criteria outlined here to reach an overall judgment, is the optimal way of applying the process. It is believed that the use of such a scheme will help to improve the consistency of study interpretation that is the foundation of hazard and risk assessment.

AB This study was carried out to investigate the natural occurrence of total aflatoxins in feedstuffs and aflatoxin M, in raw milk of dairy farms in Assiut province to evaluate the hazardous effects of these toxins on animals and humans. A total number of eighty-two representative feedstuff samples and eighty-five raw milk samples were collected from six dairy farms and two factories producing concentrate feedstuffs in Assiut province. All samples were obtained during the period from October 1999 to February 2000. Total aflatoxins in feedstuffs and aflatoxin M, in raw milk were analyzed using an ELISA technique.
   All feedstuff samples were found to contain total aflatoxin levels ranging between 2 - 60 ppb except six feed ingredient samples, which contained values lower than detection limit (1.75 ppb). The mean value of total aflatoxin in feedstuffs of all investigated dairy farms was 3.2+/-1.66 ppb. Mean values of total aflatoxin in feedstuffs ranged from 2.0-5.0 ppb in the individual farms. Overall, four samples exceeded the Egyptian maximum levels (20 ppb). The highest value was found in cottonseed meal.
   Aflatoxin M, was found in 50 (58.8%) of the investigated milk samples. The concentrations of aflatoxin M-1 ranged from nd - 15 ppt. The results obtained revealed that aflatoxin M, levels in analyzed milk samples did not reach the maximum tolerated limit of the EU countries (50 ng AFM(1)/I milk). Sixteen samples out of fifty positive samples exceeded the Swiss limits, which are the most restrictive in the world (10 ppt).
   Health hazards of aflatoxins are discussed.

AB We studied mortality and morbidity in 270 HIV-1-infected adults (60%, women, median age 31 years, mean baseline CD4 count 331/mm(3)) observed in a follow-up that lasted a median 10 months in Cote d'Ivoire. Survival and probability of remaining free from any episode of morbidity at 12 month,, were 0.80 and 6.50, respectively. Baseline CD4 count < 200/mm(2) was the only variable associated with global morbidity and mortality, with hazard ratios of 2.50 and 7.57, respectively. The most frequent causes of morbidity were severe bacterial infections (incidence rate: 26.1 per 100 person-years [py]), followed by oral candidiasis (22.3% py), unexplained weight loss over 10% of baseline body weight (13.3% py), tuberculosis (10.1% py), unexplained chronic diarrhea (9.7% py), and isosporiasis (5.1% py). Nontyphoid Salmonella accounted for 37% of isolated strains during severe bacterial infections, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (34%), Escherichia coli (15%), and Shigella species (71%). A significant part of bacterial morbidity occurred in patients with baseline CD4 count greater than or equal to 200/mm(3), in whom the incidence rate of bacterial diseases was 21.3% py and the probability of remaining free from any bacterial infection at 12 months was 0.80 (vs. 36.4% py and 0.71 in patients with baseline CD4 count < 200/mm(3); p = .07).

ID NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS
AB Geological materials usually contaminated with naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) have become a focus of great attention. These NORM under certain conditions can reach hazardous contamination levels. Some contamination levels may be sufficiently severe that precautions must be taken.
   The present study deals with 60 geological samples (marble and granite) from both Egyptian and foreign locations. The studied samples were analyzed and the concentrations in Bq/kg dry weight of radioisotopes were determined by gamma-ray spectrometry using hyper-pure germanium (HPGe) detector in Bq/kg dry weight. The absorbed dose rate due to the natural radioactivity in the samples under investigation ranged from 2.45 +/- 0.07 to 64,44 +/- 1.93 nGy/h for marble and from 41.55 +/- 1.25 to 111.94 +/- 3.36 nGy/h for granite. The radium equivalent activity varied from 5.46 +/- 0.16 to 150.52 +/- 4.52 Bq/kg for marble samples and from 229.52 +/- 6.89 to 92.16 +/- 2.76 Bq/kg for granite. The representative external hazard index values for the corresponding samples are also estimated and given.
   The radon exhalation rates for marble and granite samples were also calculated by using solid state nuclear track detector (CR-39). The value of radium exhalation rate varied from 8.0 +/- 2.39 to 30.20 +/- 5.06Bq/m(2)/d for marble and 6.89 +/- 1.72 to 25.79 +/- 4.38 Bq/m(2)/d for granite and the effective radium content was found to vary from 1,700 +/-0.51 to 6.42 +/-1.08 Bq/kg for marble and 1.29 +/-0.32 to 5.63 +/-0.96 Bq/kg for granite. The values of the radon exhalation rate and effective radium content are found to correspond with the values of uranium concentration measured by the HPGe detector in the corresponding sample.

AB Because agonistic behaviour can increase an individual's risk of predation, natural selection should favour individuals that modify their behaviour in the face of predation hazard in ways that maximise fitness. We investigated experimentally the effects of an increase in the apparent risk of predation on male-male competition within mixed-sex shoals of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). We show that males engaged in significantly fewer aggressive interactions with conspecific males in the presence of a fish predator. However, they continued to court and attempt copulations with females at the same rate irrespective of the level of predation risk. In comparison, under predation hazard, female guppies were less responsive sexually and avoided fewer male copulation attempts. Such predator-mediated changes in male-male agonistic interactions and female sexual responsiveness towards males have important implications for the mode and intensity of sexual selection within populations.

AB Objective To investigate whether the volume-weighted mean nuclear volume (MNV, the only means by which unbiased estimates of three-dimensional variables can be obtained from a two-dimensional section by stereological methods) at diagnosis correlates with tumour biology and clinical behaviour in patients with prostate cancer treated by watchful waiting.
   Patients and methods In a prognostic study, 64 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were followed prospectively with initial expectant management. The median (mean, range) follow-up was 22 (27, 6.0-68) months. The prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (PSADT) was calculated by linear regression. The MNV was estimated using biopsy specimens, based on a stereological method, and compared with PSADT and traditional clinicopathological variables.
   Results PSADT was significantly associated with MNV, but not with other clinicopathological variables. The PSA 'rapid-riser' subset (PSADT<median value) had significantly larger MNVs than did the PSA 'slow-riser' (PSADT<greater than or equal to>median value) and PSA-stable subsets (P=0.0017 and 0.004, respectively). On multivariate analysis using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression, only MNV remained independently significant as a predictor of clinical progression among the clinicopathological variables (P<0.001).
   Conclusions These findings suggest that cancer cell nuclear volume is significantly associated with tumour biology and behaviour in patients with prostate cancer. Although further study with a larger patient population is needed to confirm the findings, estimates of MNV may be an important prognostic indicator in men treated with watchful waiting.

TI Failure in Mohr-Coulomb soil cavities

DE roof stability; regularized Mohr-Coulomb material; limit analysis;
   failure mechanics
AB In many cavities, resulting from both natural excavation and anthropic action, the phenomenon of the collapse of blocks from the cavity roof presents a serious safety hazard. In a previous publication the authors proposed a method to calculate the shape and dimensions of the collapsing block by means of the upper bound theorem of the plasticity theory. The soft rock material was modelled by means of the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, and the associated flow rule was considered for strain plastic velocity. The linear yield criterion was suitably regularized by means of a circle in the tensile zone. The boundary of the collapsing block is described by a paraboloid surface. An optimization procedure formulated in standard Kuhn-Tucker form and an analytical solution were obtained. The above-mentioned algorithm has been successfully applied to common soils of southern Italy. To validate the theoretical formulation, several numerical tests are performed. These tests show an optimal agreement with the closed-form solution. Therefore the proposed modelling may be used as an efficient guideline for the cavity-strengthening design.

ID CHRYSOTILE ASBESTOS
AB Asbestos is a generic term used to describe natural mineral fibers found in the ground in many regions of the world. This cheap material with special chemical and physical properties that make it virtually indestructible was widely used in the 20th century. Within twenty years of the first industrial production, the public health hazards associated with asbestos started to come to light. Asbestos has become one of the most worrying industrial pollutants, since it poses a health hazard of asbestosis, lung cancer, mesotheliomas, and benign changes in the pleura. In spite of the WHO recommendations, environmental health criteria and their revision, asbestos is still around.

TI Historic fire regime in Southern California shrublands
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NORTHERN BAJA-CALIFORNIA; MEXICO; FOREST
AB Historical variability in fire regime is a conservative indicator of ecosystem sustainability, and thus understanding the natural role of fire in chaparral ecosystems is necessary for proper fire management, It has been suggested that the "natural" fire regime was one of frequent small fires that fragmented the landscape into a fine-grained mixture of age classes that precluded large, catastrophic fires. Some researchers claim that this regime was lost because of highly effective fire suppression and conclude that if fire managers could "restore" a regime of frequent fires with widespread prescription burning, they could eliminate the hazard of catastrophic fires. The primary evidence in support of this model is a study that compared contemporary burning patterns in southern California, US.A., a region subject to fire suppression, with patterns in northern Baja California, Mexico, where there is less effective fire suppression. We found that differences ill fire regime between these two regions are inconclusive and could not be ascribed conclusively to differences in fire suppression. Historical records suggest that the natural fire regime in southern California shrublands was rather coarse-grained and not substantively different from the contemporary regime. There is no evidence that fire-management policies have created the contemporary fire regime dominated by massive Santa Ana wind-driven fires. Increased expenditures on fire suppression and increased loss of property and lives are the result of human demographic patterns that place increasing demand on fire-suppression forces.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE Yellow River; flood disaster; river's drying up; siltation; sediment
   management
AB Flood and water shortage are two of the leading environmental problems around the world, and among the causes of the problems is sedimentation. The Yellow River brought disastrous floods in its lower reaches in Chinese history. Today, although floods caused by the river are still a formidable hazard hanging over China, it cannot provide the lower reaches with enough usable water. The ineradicable flood hazard and newly emerged water shortage problems of the river are proved to be closely associated with its immense sediment load. The over loaded flow of the river can quickly fill the reservoirs and unceasingly raise the riverbed, attenuating the capacity of reservoirs to suppress floods and provide more water for dry seasons and of river channels to convey floods. Also, the high sediment content pollutes the water and reduces the volume of usable water. In virtue of the intimate linkage between these problems and the formidable sediment load in the river, the solution to these problems should be based on sedimentation management. After reviewing the defects and merits of management measures implemented and proposed, a management scenario composed of multiple measures are recommended. Beside of persistent soil conservation to reduce the huge sediment load, more reservoirs to check sediment and regulate river flows, approaches to alleviating riverbed accretion, interbasin water transfer to mitigate water deficiency, and so on, an emphasis should be laid on use of muddy flows in order to scatter the sediment in a vast area, which was a natural process but has been interrupted by construction of embankments.

AB Nearly fifty years have elapsed since the term mycotoxicosis was first used for the diseases resulting from the growth of fungi in foods and feeds (Forgacs & Carll 1952) and nearly 40 years since Turkey X disease signalled the discovery of aflatoxins (Austwick & Ayerst 1963). Mycotoxins have long since passed from the realms of laboratory curiosities to the position where they are recognised as an important cause of human and animal disease. Enough knowledge has now accumulated for questions to be posed on the importance of mycotoxins in human health in Australia, a country where the perception is that mycotoxins are not a health risk. How realistic is that perception?

AB Flood risk has usually been studied in natural sciences and engineering. Floods, being natural phenomena, represent a hazard only with respect to human society. Therefore "the human response component" is no less important in flood risk assessment than those components studied traditionally. This paper presents the results of a study of the perception of flood risk among decision makers and the general public in a flood-affected area of Norway. A poll investigation addressing the public and an expert panel addressing the decision makers were used for data collection. The information obtained was analysed focusing on: (a) the perception of risk for life and health; (b) economic and environmental loss by the two groups; (c) the links for communicating the flood risk message; and (d) appropriate flood mitigation measures in particular situations and the ability of the decision makers to visualize their effects and costs. The results show that the perception of flood hazard by the general public is not realistic and that the flood risk message should be communicated better. The transparency of the different decisions made during a flood situation and their effects on the degree of risk need to be improved. The knowledge gained can be used for developing a flood assessment policy based on participatory principles.

AB In hydrology, meteorology, oceanography, climatology and, more generally, in geophysics-all sciences which are involved in water resources management, researches and studies-technological and operational developments come up against a fundamental difficulty which is the extreme variability of geophysical fields. This extreme variability is often associated with natural hazards such as earthquakes, tornados, droughts, or floods and with a very large range of scales. This range extends from millimetres to thousands of kilometres in space, from milliseconds to geological eras in time. The traditional approaches to studying geophysical fields tend to ignore these basic empirical facts by making drastic truncations, that is to say studying one scale independently of the others, transforming partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations, arbitrarily hypothesizing the homogeneity of fields, and performing ad hoe and unjustified parameterizations. Alternative approaches to nonlinear variability are based on a fundamental property of nonlinear equations: scale invariance. In this paper, an attempt is made to give some examples of such scale invariant behaviour of hydrological processes and fields-mainly from empirical evidence. Furthermore, it is shown why and how the multifractal approach, which is still at the developmental stage, is a very promising! domain. This approach may provide hydrology with useful concepts that could tomorrow turn into essential tools for water resource management.

ID DRAINAGE
AB Metal mobility and distribution in water and sediments in the surroundings of the pyrite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite mine of Libiola, in the Gromolo Valley near Sestri Levante (Genova), are investigated to evaluate the environmental hazard in the area. The mineralisation, related to Apennine ophiolites, was already known in the Bronze Age (about 2500 yr BC), but economic exploitation started in the XVII century. Open galleries, waste dumps and acid drainage testified the past mining activities which ended in 1965.
   Mine waste material, covering an area of about 0.5 km(2), is reddish-yellowish, generally coarse-grained and stratified. The waste is a mixture of basalt, ultramafic-derived and iron-rich phases, with relatively high concentrations of S (mean 0.3% S) and Cu (mean 0.3% Cu), and significant contents of Zn, As, Mo and Se.
   Acid drainage, with pH values as low as 2.5, is quite rich in dissolved Fe, Al, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni. Repeated sampling revealed marked chemical variations, particularly in the mine waste area, depending on water flow conditions. Where low-pH water mixes with normal (pH 8) surface water, reddish amorphous iron phases (e.g. ferrihydrite, schwertmannite) precipitate, favouring the scavenging of many elements carried by the acid waters and providing a natural way of remediation for the stream waters. The rapid flocculation causes anomalous contents of Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Sc, Y, La, Ce, and to a lesser extent of Cr and Ni, in the sediments. Although the ochreous colloids are important components of the Gromolo River sediments for about 8 km from the mine, preliminary results indicate that, unless natural conditions change, remobilisation of heavy metals should not be expected.

AB Objective To assess the effects of acute blood pressure (BP) on long-term mortality following stroke.
   Design Prospective observational study.
   Setting Leicester Teaching Hospitals.
   Patients Two hundred and nineteen consecutive patients were recruited within 24 h of acute stroke.
   Interventions Clinic and 24 h BP levels were measured. Other risk factors previously associated with stroke mortality were recorded within 24 h of admission. No specific pharmacological interventions;were made.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome measure was death over a median follow-up period of over 2.5 years. The hazards ratios associated with predefined variables were assessed using Cox's proportional hazards modelling, and Kaplan-Meier survival plots were also calculated.
   Results On multiple variable analysis, 24 h systolic BP (greater than or equal to 160 mmHg) was associated with an increased hazards ratio of 2.41 (95% confidence intervals: 1.24-4.67) for death, compared to the reference group (140-159 mmHg). The addition of 24 h heart rate was significant, with increasing heart rate (> 83 bpm) associated with an increased mortality (P = 0.006), although this effect was not constant over time. Increasing age (> 80 years) at presentation was also associated with an increased hazards ratio of 2.53 (1.14-5.62) compared to age less than or equal to 66 years.
   Conclusions This study provides evidence that elevated 24 h systolic BP in the acute stroke period is associated with increased long-term mortality. This may have implications in the therapeutic management of BP following stroke, though further research is required to determine the timing, nature and effect of such an intervention.

TI Surgical treatment for secundum atrial septal defects in patients > 40
   years old - A randomized clinical trial

AB OBJECTIVES We prospectively examined whether surgical treatment of secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) in patients greater than or equal to 40 years old improves their long-term clinical outcome.
   BACKGROUND Surgical treatment of secundum ASDs in adults >40 years old is a subject of controversy because of the perception of good long-term clinical outcomes in patients with unrepaired ASDs and the lack of data from randomized trials.
   METHODS We recruited 521 patients >40 years old with secundum ASDs referred for treatment; 48 were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to surgical closure (n = 232) or medical treatment (n = 241). The primary and secondary end points were a composite of major cardiovascular events (death, pulmonary embolism, major arrhythmic event, embolic cerebrovascular event, recurrent pulmonary infection, functional class deterioration or heart failure) and overall mortality, respectively. We assessed possible prognostic markers. The analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
   RESULTS The median follow-up period was 7.3 years (range 2 to 13). The risk of having the primary end point was significantly higher in the medical group, which had a univariate hazards ratio of 1.99 (95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.23 to 3.22) and a multivariate hazards ratio of 1.85 (95% CI 1.08 to 3.17). Although the survival analysis did not reveal differences in overall mortality between the surgical and medical treatments (hazards ratio 1.71, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.86), the multivariate analysis, adjusted by age at entry, mean pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac index, demonstrated significant differences between the study groups (hazards ratio 4.09, 95% CI 1.41 to 11.89).
   CONCLUSIONS Surgical closure was superior to medical treatment in improving both the composite of major cardiovascular events and overall mortality in patients >40 years old with secundum ASDs. This superiority was related to the mean pulmonary artery pressure, age at diagnosis and cardiac index. Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality, we believe that anatomic closure should always be attempted as the initial treatment for ASDs in adults >40 years old with pulmonary artery systolic pressure <70 mm Hg and a pulmonary/systemic output ratio <greater than or equal to>1.7. The operation must be performed as soon as possible, even if the symptoms or the hemodynamic impact seems to be minimal.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of claudication and determine risk factors for ischemic rest pain (IRP) and ischemic ulceration (IU) among patients with claudication.
   Methods: We prospectively collected data on 1244 men with claudication during a 15-year period, including demographics, clinical risk factors, and ankle-brachial index (ABI). We followed these patients serially with ABIs, self-reported walking distance (WalkDist), and monitoring for IRP and IU. We used Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards modeling to find independent predictors of IRP and IU.
   Results. Mean follow-up was 45 months; statistically valid follow-up could be carried out for as long as 12 years. ABI declined an average of 0.014 per year. WalkDist declined at an average rate of 9.2 yards per year. The cumulative 10-year risks of development of IU and IRP were 23% and 30%, respectively. In multivariate analysis using several clinical risk factors, we found that only DM (relative risk [RR], 1.8) and ABI (RR 2.2 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) predicted the development of IRP. Similarly, only DM (RR, 3.0) and ABI (RR, 1.9 for 0.1 decrease in ABI) were significant predictors of IU.
   Conclusion. This large serial study of claudication is, to our knowledge, the longest of its kind. We documented an average rate of ABI decline of 0.014 per year and a decline in WalkDist of 9.2 yards per year. Two clinical factors, ABI and DM, were found to be associated with the development of IRP and IU. Our findings may be useful in predicting the clinical course of claudication.

TI Impact of interferon beta-1a on neurologic disability in relapsing
   multiple sclerosis
SO NEUROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY
AB Background and Objective: A phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated that interferon beta-1a (IFN beta -1a) (Avonex, Biogen) significantly delayed progression of disability in relapsing MS patients. The primary clinical outcome was time from study entry until disability progression, defined as greater than or equal to1.0 point worsening from baseline Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score persisting for at least two consecutive scheduled visits separated by 6 months. The objective of this study was to examine the magnitude of benefit on EDSS and its clinical significance. Methods: Post hoc analyses related to disability outcomes using data collected during the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial. Results: (1) Clinical efficacy related to disability did not depend on the definition of disability progression. A significant benefit in favor of IFN beta -1a was observed when greater than or equal to2.0 point worsening from baseline EDSS was required or when worsening was required to persist for greater than or equal to1.0 year. (2) Placebo recipients who reached the primary clinical outcome worsened by a larger amount from baseline EDSS than did IFN beta -1a recipients who reached the primary study outcome. (3) Significantly fewer IFN beta -1a recipients progressed to EDSS milestones of 4.0 (relatively severe impairment) or 6.0 (unilateral assistance needed to walk). (4) Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that the only baseline characteristic strongly correlated with longer time to disability progression was IFN beta -1a treatment. Conclusions: The primary clinical outcome for the IFN beta -1a clinical trial underestimated clinical benefits of treatment. Results in this report demonstrate that IFN beta -1a treatment is associated with robust, clinically important beneficial effects on disability progression in relapsing MS patients.

AB This article presents a numerical study of external heat and smoke spread caused by compartment fires in multistory buildings. Usually, a building fire causes not only hazard to the occupants in that compartment, but also poses a possible threat to the occupants in other compartments, in particular to those located at upper stories. In this study, three scenarios with different window configurations are performed on the basis of the Navier-Stokes equations and the standard k-epsilon model. Analysis of the computational results found that the window configurations and area as well as its location affect the heat and smoke pattern and in turn the safety of the occupants at upper stories. This implies that window design for multistory buildings, in terms of fire safety, should be carefully considered.

AB Historically explosion accidents are linked with energetic materials. There is the further belief, that the proneness to accidents-and their severity-is linked with the sensitivity of these explosives. Consequently there exist seemingly very insensitive materials for which it is believed that their accidental explosion can be ignored, so that safety distances can be reduced to those that apply to materials for which the hazard is assumed to be mass fire rather than mass detonation. Evidence is presented here that shows these assumptions to be invalid. Reports of explosion accidents are gathered here for substances that are not generally considered to be explosives (non UN-class 1 substances, like ammonium nitrate (AN), neat alkali metal chlorates, and even hypochlorites and nitromethane). In most of these cases the proneness of accidents had not been foreseen by testing.
   The basic explosion mechanisms are of a more general nature than simply those that apply to high explosives. Explosion is not solely a matter of energy, but of any physical power conversion. In order to prove this, a survey of explosion events is given: Natural events, like the impacts of celestial bodies and volcanic eruptions. Fuel/liquid interactions in nature are industrial risks too, which occur at very different occasions and sites: Cellulose processing, the oil industry, foundries, power stations, explosions of hot cinders, chemical processing, fire extinguishing, and (most common) in the kitchen, and (most catastrophic) in nuclear reactors. Explosions of similar type are Hydraulic Transients, Bubble resonance explosions with the possibility associatcd chemical room explosions (BLEVE), Rollovers. Second order effects are sorption/desorption resonance explosions, which most powerful also occur in nature (Nios Lake (CO2-release), Kivu Lake, Monoun Lake, 1984, Tanganjika Lake, all in Africa, and the Ocracoke in the Gulf of Mexico (CH4-release-and at the lowest end shaken champagne bottles.
   All these explosions are "low probability-high risk" explosive phenomena, which are scarcely coverable by risk studies with the present day scientific tools on explosion phenomena. Up to now only in the nuclear branch a quantitative risk of explosion was brought to attention, therefore, the validity of this approach was carefully examinated.

   DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; WOMEN; RISK
AB Background. The natural history of mild hyperparathyroidism is incompletely clarified.
   Methods. Consistent hyperalcemia was found in 172 patients (aged 28-86 years) participating in population-based screenings in both 1969 and 1971. Mortalily until 1994 was compared with 344 matched, normocalcemic controls from the study population. Altogether; 55 case-control pairs underwent biochemical analysis in 1992, whereas 86 patients had died, 8 were lost to follow-up, and 23 had undergone parathyroid operation.
   Results. Mortality was higher (P =.015) in Patients younger than 70 years. Cardiovascular diseases were over-represented causes of death. The hazard ratio for hypercalcemia as an independent cause of cardiovascular mortality was 1.72 (95% CI, 1.24-2.37; P < .001). The initially mild hypercalcemia in patients (2,67 +/- 0.07 mmol/L) decreased over lime (P =.0001), whereas the serum calcium value remained constant in the controls. Serum calcium and serum parathyroid hormone, values in patients were higher than controls at the follow-up) (P < .0001,.01, respectively). All but 17 patients Were, normocalcemic in 1992, and only 2 (1.4 %) developed a serum calcium value higher than 3 mmol/l.
   Conclusions. Mild hypercalcemia in patients followed up for more than 2 decades is accompanied by premature cardiovascular death despite trends to spontaneous resolution. The principal cause calcemia probably is primary hyperparathyroidism, but mechanisms contributiny to its regression over time are speculative.

AB Although most health scientists now agree that health risks to the skin (e.g., skin cancer) exist from exposure to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. a scientific consensus has not really been achieved vis-a-vis sunlight and ocular health. A growing number of scientists warn of hazards to the eye if ultraviolet radiation - and perhaps even shorter wavelength visible radiation also - is not filtered by lenses. Despite a substantial literature on the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and intense light upon ocular structures, particularly upon the retina, controversy still surrounds the question of whether the levels of natural and man-made light sources are damaging when encountered under normal viewing conditions. Although scientific evidence accumulates to indicate that chronic exposure conditions may accelerate ageing processes in ocular tissues, the quantitative question of "How much is safe?" remains to be answered conclusively.

AB The spatial and temporal pattern of annual rainfall and the strength of the dry season within the Amazon region are poorly known. Existing rainfall maps are based on the data from full-scale, long-term meteorological stations, operated by national organizations linked to the World Meteor- ological Organisation, such as INMET in Brazil. Stations with 30 or more years of uninterrupted and reliable recordings are very few, considering the size of the region, and most of them are located along the major rivers. It has been suggested that rainfall conditions away from these rivers are substantially different. An analysis has been made of the records of a network of simple pluviometric sites in the Brazilian part of the region as maintained by the National Agency for Electric Energy (ANEEL) since 1970. The latter data sets were used to draw more detailed maps on annual rainfall, and on the strength of the dry season in particular; average number of consecutive months with less than 100 mm, 50 mm, and 10 mm, respectively. Also, some data were obtained on the spatial expression of El Nino events within the region. Subregional differences are large, and it is argued that they are important for the success or failure of agricultural settlements; for the hazard of large-scale fire damage of the still existing primary forest vegetation; for the functioning of this land cover as stock and sink Of CO2, and for the likelihood that secondary forests on abandoned agricultural lands will have less biomass. The effects of past El Nino rainfall anomalies on the biodiversity of the natural savannahs within the forest region are discussed.

AB Objectives. The coexistence of carcinomas of the endometrium and ovary occurs in about 10% of women with ovarian carcinoma. It is often unclear whether this represents synchronous primary tumors or metastasis from endometrium to ovary, or from ovary to endometrium; consequently, staging, therapy, and expected outcome are uncertain. The Gynecologic Oncology Group sought to study patients with simultaneously detected adenocarcinomas in the endometrium and ovary with disease grossly confined to the pelvis to explore the possible correlation among discrete tumor subsets, natural history, and survival.
   Methods. Between 1985 and 1991, 85 patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 74 were eligible. All were initially treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging laparotomy, with radiation and chemotherapy left to the discretion of the treating physician and patient. Fifteen pathologic variables were examined to identify differences in tumor behavior.
   Results. Of the 74 patients, 23 (31%) had microscopic spread of tumor in the pelvis or abdomen. Sixty-four (86%) patients had endometrioid carcinomas in both the endometrium and the ovary, and endometriosis was found in the ovary of 23 (31%) patients. There was concordance between the histologic grade of the tumor in the ovary and the uterus in 51 (69%) patients. The estimated probability of recurrence 5 years following staging surgery is 15.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.7-25.2%). The presence of metastasis discriminated two groups of patients that experienced different probabilities of recurrence within 5 years: 10.0% (95% CI: 4.32-21.3%) for those with tumors confined to the uterus and ovary and 27.1% (95% CI: 13.0-48.5%) for those with metastasis (hazard ratio = 4.6, P = 0.006). The histologic grades of ovarian and uterine tumors also distinguished groups of patients with different probabilities of recurrence at 5 years: 8.0% (95% CI: 2.8-21.3%) for those patients with no more than grade 1 disease at either site and 22.4% (95% CI: 11.8-38.4%) for those with a higher grade in either the ovary or the endometrium (hazard ratio = 3.1, P = 0.047). The estimated overall probability of surviving 5 years is 85.9% and that of surviving 10 years is 80.3%.
   Conclusion. The prognosis for women with simultaneously detected carcinomas in the uterus and ovary with gross disease confined to the pelvis is surprisingly good, particularly for those with disease microscopically limited to the uterus and ovary or of low histologic grade.

AB Radon monitoring has become a global phenomenon due to its health hazard. More than 55% radiation dose delivered to the human kind on the globe from all natural sources is due to radon alone. Radon measurements have been carried out in groundwater in Gurdaspur and Bathinda districts of Punjab, India. Radon concentration values in potable water show a wide variation depending on its source and location. Generally, radon concentration values in hand-pump drawn groundwater have been found to be higher than the values determined for water supplied from other sources. Mineral water has the minimum radon concentration compared with groundwater sources. No correlation is found between radon. concentration and uranium content of groundwater in Bathinda district.

AB Background: The present study was conducted to examine the natural history of superficial bladder cancer.
   Methods: One hundred and forty-four patients with superficial bladder cancer who had been treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) alone were analyzed.
   Results: The non-recurrence rate was 64.8% at 36 months and 61.2% at 60 months after TURBt. When the non-recurrence rate after TURBt: was analyzed by background variables, the rate differed significantly between the solitary tumor group and the multiple tumor group, The tumor recurrence hazard curves for the entire population had one high peak before 500 days and another slight peak around 1500 days after TURBt.
   Conclusions: These results will provide basic information useful when evaluating new regimens of intravesical instillation therapy for prophylaxis of superficial bladder cancer after our complete TURBt in the Nara Uro-Oncology Research Group.

ID WATER AVAILABILITY; LOWLAND CONDITIONS; PERFORMANCE
AB Experiments were conducted in Bangkok clay soil to investigate the influence of planting date, tiller separation and plant density on the yield and yield attributes of parent and clone plants of two transplanted rice varieties. The 15 July transplanting of mother crop and collected vegetative tillers and retransplanting on 15 August showed significantly high grain yield (3.8 t/ha). The photoperiod-insensitive variety RD23 gave higher yield (3.8 t/ha) than the photoperiod-sensitive variety KDML105 (3.0 t/ha). Tiller separation up to 4 tillers/hill did not adversely affect the mother crop. Vegetative tillers transplanted with 2-4 tillers/hill gave a similar yield as the mother crop in both the seasons. Vegetative tillers gave a higher yield than nursery seedlings transplanted on the same date. The yield components, i.e. weight of 1000 grains, grains/panicle and per cent filled grains, showed better responses with early transplanting of KDML105 in the mother crop and vegetative tillers except for particle number and particle length of vegetative tillers with RD23. The results suggest that in some flood-prone lowlands, where the transplanted crop is damaged by natural hazards, vegetative propagation using tillers separated (maximum 4/hill) from the previously established transplanted crop is beneficial for higher productivity.

AB Pseudomonas aeraginosa cells were inoculated into different waters and sampled after different periods of starvation in order to evaluate the influences of storage under daylight or dark conditions, the presence or absence of the autochthonous flora, the chemical composition of the water and the storage temperature, on survival. Survival was investigated by plate counts on selective and nonselective agar media. Light, low temperature (4C) and presence of the autochthonous flora negatively influenced the survival of P. aeruginosa during starvation in water. Higher survival rates were observed in waters with high mineral content. During starvation, cells developed sensitivity to the selective medium demonstrating that research is needed in the development of new media, or improvement in the existing ones, for the enumeration of P. aeruginosa in water. Current selective media/methodologies for detecting P. aeruginosa in mineral waters may seriously underestimate the levels of or presence of this organism which might represent, in some cases, a hazard to the public health.

AB Background and Objectives: Malignant mesothelioma is a lethal disease. Aggressive multimodality treatment protocols are reportedly associated with improved survival, but the apparent survival benefits may simply reflect patient selection and the variable natural history of this malignancy. Before embarking on our own protocol of experimental treatment for mesothelioma, we sought to identify important prognostic factors and document the survival of patients treated conservatively (with palliative intent only) in our region.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients with a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma seen at our center between 1987 and 1999. Since curative intent treatment had not been given, we assumed that measured survival would largely reflect the natural history of the malignancy.
   Results: There were 101 patients (80 males and 21 females). Mean age was 65 +/- 9.2 years. Symptoms of disease were present for a median time of 5 months before the diagnosis was established. The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea (46 patients), chest pain (30 patients), and weight loss (22 patients). Sixty-eight patients (68%) had a history of asbestos exposure. Mesothelioma subtypes included epithelial (43 patients), sarcomatous (26 patients), mixed (19 patients), desmoplastic (4 patients), and unspecified (9 patients). All 101 patients were treated with palliative intent. Tale pleurodesis was performed in 70 patients. At the time of analysis, 90 patients had died and 11 remained alive. Median survival was 213 (95% CI 137-289) days. Survival for the three major histological subtypes was significantly different (log rank, P = 0.0016). Histological subtype (epithelial favorable) was the only significant independent prognostic factor (Cox proportional hazard regression, P = 0.0009).
   Conclusions: Patients with epithelial mesothelioma survive longer than those with other histological subtypes. Conservatively managed patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma have a median survival of approximately 7 months. These data from conservatively treated patients can serve as baseline information for future studies of experimental treatments. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   POPULATION; SUBTYPES; MECHANISMS
AB Background and Purpose-A low risk of recurrent stroke and death after lacunar infarction has previously been reported, but follow-up has been limited to less than or equal to5 years.
   Methods-One hundred eighty patients with pure motor stroke, collected between 1983 and 1986 from a hospital-based stroke registry, were followed up until at least 10 years after the index stroke. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Survival status was determined from the official population registry and compared with survival rates of the Swedish population, matched for age and sex. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic predictors.
   Results-During follow-up 106 (60%) of the 178 patients died, most commonly as a result of coronary heart disease. During the first 5 years after the stroke, survival rates were similar to those of the general population. Beyond this time the risk of death was increased among patients with pure motor stroke, with an excess of 10 to 15 percent units compared with the general population. Independent determinants for death were age (P <0.01), male sex (P <0.01), and nonuse of acetylsalicylic acid (P=0.02). Recurrent stroke occurred in 42 (23.5%) of the patients, corresponding to an annual risk of 2.4%. Hypertension (P=0.025) and diabetes (P=0.024) were independent risk factors for recurrent stroke. Conclusions-For the first few years after lacunar infarct, the risk of death was similar to that of the general population, but later a clear excess of death was observed. The long-term prognosis in lacunar infarction appears less favorable than previously reported.

TI Combining lanekeeping and vehicle following with hazard maps
SO VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AVOIDANCE
AB This paper addresses the issues involved with including moving obstacles in a hazard map or potential field framework for driver assistance systems. Under such a framework, control forces must consist of either conservative forces obtained from the gradient of a potential or artificial damping. By treating vehicle following as a combination of a safety distance and a hazard or potential function, common following strategies, such as constant time headway and guaranteed collision avoidance, can be incorporated into this framework without modification. When combining these fields with lateral potential fields for lanekeeping, however, challenges arise due to the natural asymmetry between the longitudinal and lateral velocity of a vehicle. For instance, a decision to change lanes while approaching a slow moving vehicle results in a large amount of undesirable energy transfer into the lateral dynamics. By treating the lateral and longitudinal hazards - described in road-fixed coordinates - as decoupled, however, such transfers can be eliminated. Because of the manner in which the lateral and longitudinal dynamics couple, control with decoupled hazard maps resembles the coupled case when following or lanekeeping while eliminating the problems associated with energy transfer. The paper concludes by discussing the characteristics of the dynamic equations that lead to this result and outlining future work in obtaining rigorous hazard bounds for the decoupled controller.

AB Background. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a recently described cytokine produced mainly by macrophages, stimulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production by natural killer cells and T cells. Although it has been reported that serum IL-18 levels are higher in patients with advanced tuberculosis and acute graft-versus-host disease compared with normal controls, the authors found no reports regarding serum IL-18 levels in patients with malignant solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to determine serum IL-18 levels and their clinical significance in patients vith gastric carcinoma.
   Methods. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 94 patients with gastric carcinoma who underwent curative surgery and from 50 healthy volunteers. The serum IL-18 level, the IFN-gamma, level, and the Helicobacter pylori (HP) serology status were determined in each sample with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results. The mean serum IL-18 level for all patients was significantly higher compared with the mean level in healthy volunteers (P<0.01). IFN-<gamma> titers were below the level of detection in all samples tested. When the patients were subdivided into groups, it was found that the serum IL-18 level in patients with Stage II and III disease was significantly higher compared with the level found in healthy volunteers (P<0.01). The serum IL-18 level decreased after patients underwent surgical resection. However, there was no significant difference in the serum IL-18 level between healthy controls and patients with Stage I or IV disease. Patients with IL-18 levels <greater than or equal to>310 pg/mL (i.e., equal to or greater than the mean levels +/-1 standard deviation in the healthy volunteers) experienced a significantly lower survival rate compared with patients who had IL-18 levels <310 pg/mL after undergoing surgery (P<0.05) despite a lack of any discernible difference in clinicopathologic factors between the two groups, The serum IL-18 level was identified as an independent postoperative prognostic factor in multivariate survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, 4.89; P=0.01). There was no significant correlation between HP serology status and serum IL-18 levels.
   Conclusions, The preoperative serum IL-18 level may represent a significant postoperative prognostic determinant in patients with gastric carcinoma. Its function in the host immune system remains to be elucidated. Cancer 2001;92:2050-5. (C) 2001 American Cancer Society.

TI Latex aeroallergen quantification in hospitals of Moscow, Russia
SO ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Health care workers (HCWs) who use latex gloves regularly are at a significant risk for developing allergic sensitization to natural rubber latex (NRL) proteins. The airborne route of exposure presents a hazard for sensitization and subsequent allergic symptoms.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure the content of the NRL proteins in the air of work areas (laboratories, treatment rooms, operating rooms, examination rooms, and dentist's treatment rooms) in eight Moscow hospitals where the employees used powdered latex gloves.
   Methods: The air samples were collected by a volumetric filtration method using a static air sampler at a flow rate of 3 L/second. Airborne particles were collected onto polytetrafluoroethylene filters rated 99.9% efficient at 0.3 mum. The NRL allergens were extracted from the air filter samples in phosphate-buffered saline and quantified by an inhibition immunoassay using a five-person pool of sera containing latex-specific human immunoglobulin E.
   Results: The airborne latex allergen concentrations in 11 areas (including positive control) where latex gloves were used varied from 5 to 26 ng/m(3). Conversely, in 12 areas where latex gloves were seldom used or where powdered-free latex gloves were used allergen levels were not detectable (including two negative controls). The hi-hest concentration of latex allergen (26 ng/m(3)) was found in an examination room of a gynecology department. Low and moderate concentrations were detected in most operating rooms, and low concentrations in the laboratories and treatment rooms.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that, in general, the airborne NRL concentrations in the work areas of Moscow hospitals are rather low compared with NRL concentrations reported from American hospitals and are dependent on the intensity of latex glove usage.

AB This paper deals with the development of a technique for mapping landslide susceptibility using a geographical information system (GIS), with particular reference to landslides on natural terrain. The method has been applied to Lantau Island, the largest outlying island within the territory of Hong Kong. Landslide susceptibility in the study area is related to a number of terrain variables, viz., lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, land cover, and distance to drainage line. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was carried out to generate the principal axes that are linear combinations of these terrain variables using occurrence data of landslides and terrain variables. A GIS is used to project the values of the principal axes, and subsequently to relate these principal axes to landslide susceptibility by logistic regression modeling. The spatial landslide susceptibility response in the study area can then be obtained by applying this logistic regression model to the study area. The results from this study indicate that such a GIS-based model is useful and suitable for the scale adopted in this study.

SO CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
DE avalanche; landslide; rockfall; hazard; tsunami
AB A geological disaster occurs when natural geological processes impact on our activities, either through loss of life or injury or through economic loss. A geological hazard is a potential disaster. Geological hazard in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador was studied by archival research using a variety of sources to document the historical record of disaster. This record, although undoubtedly incomplete and selective, demonstrates that the province was affected by numerous geological disasters that inflicted a major economic and social cost. At least 80 people have been killed in Newfoundland and Labrador since 1863 in such incidents, including debris flows, rockfalls, avalanches, and tsunamis. Many Newfoundland communities have developed at the base of steep slopes and are therefore prone to landslides and avalanches or are built adjacent to the coast and are susceptible to storm damage. The economic cost is difficult to estimate, but remedial measures for individual events range from Can$ 20 000 for the construction of 50 m of gabions and retaining walls to Can$ 3 000 000 for community-level coastal flood-protection measures. Many of the documented geological disasters were unavoidable and were the inevitable result of geography. However, some were predictable and therefore preventable, either because a similar event had previously occurred in the same area or because geological factors, such as rapid coastal erosion or rising relative sea levels, were not considered during the planning process. The identification of serious avalanche and rockfall hazards in the Battery, St. John's, has led to installation of protective measures. Archival research methods provide a cheap, effective, and useful means of defining regional geological hazard.

ID PRACTICE GUIDELINES COMMITTEE; ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; NATURAL-HISTORY;

AB Objective-To determine the prognostic value of exercise testing, valve area, and maximum transaortic pressure gradient in asymptomatic patients with aortic valve stenosis.
   Setting-The outpatient service of a tertiary referral centre for cardiology.
   Design-Prospective clinical study.
   Patients-66 consecutive patients with isolated severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area less than or equal to 1.0 cm(2)) were selected over a 58 month period. Mean (SD) follow up was 14.77 (11.93) months.
   Interventions-At the initial visit Doppler echocardiography and exercise testing were performed to evaluate ST segment depression and the development of symptoms of aortic stenosis, ventricular arrhythmia, or inadequate rise of systolic blood pressure during exercise. Follow up clinical examinations were performed every three months thereafter to record the onset of symptoms.
   Main outcome measures-Sudden death or the development of symptoms.
   Results-Eight patients developed dizziness during exercise testing but made a rapid and spontaneous recovery. No other complications of exercise testing occurred. Survival curves, with or without the occurrence of end point events for the variables studied, showed significant differences for positive versus negative exercise testing (p = 0.0001) and aortic valve area < 0.7 cm(2) upsilon greater than or equal to 0.7 cm(2) (p = 0.0021). There was no relation between the end points and transaortic gradient (p = 0.6882). In multivariate analysis, a hazard ratio of 7.43 was calculated for patients with a positive versus a negative exercise stress test. Although asymptomatic in daily life, 6% of the patients (4/66) experienced sudden death; all these had a positive exercise test and an aortic valve area of less than or equal to 0.6 cm(2).
   Conclusions-Exercise testing is safe and is of prognostic value in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis.

AB Coal and its by-product fly ash are technologically important materials being used for power generation and in the manufacture of bricks, sheets, cement, land-filling, etc. respectively. Increased interest in measuring radon concentration in coal, fly ash and cement is due to its health hazards and environmental pollution. As the presence of radon in the environment (indoor and outdoor), soil, ground water, oil and gas deposits contributes the largest fraction of the natural radiation dose to populations, tracking its concentration is thus of paramount importance for radiological protection. Samples of coal and fly ash were collected from different thermal power stations in northern India and cement samples from National Council for Cement and Building Materials, Ballabgarh (Haryana), India and were analysed for radon concentration. For the measurement, alpha sensitive LR-115 type II plastic track detectors were used. Based upon the available data, the annual effective dose and the lifetime fatality risk factors have been calculated, The radon concentration from coal samples varied from 433 +/- 28 Bq m(-3) to 2086 +/- 28 Bq m-3. The radon concentration from fly ash samples. varied from 748 +/- 28 Bq m(-3) to 1417 +/- 111 Bq m(-3) and from 158 Bq m(-3) to 1810 Bq m(-3) in cement samples, with an average of 624 +/- 169 Bq m(-3).

AB Prior to the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV-R) in AIDS patients was characterized by multiple relapses and decreased survival. Recent data suggest that CMV-R in patients treated with HAART may remain relapse-free for long periods. We performed a study of the effects of HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) on the incidence of relapse and time to death in AIDS patients with CMV-R treated with anti-CMV therapy. Medical records of all AIDS patients with CMV-R at Parkland Memorial Health and Hospital System treated with anti-CMV agents were reviewed for date of diagnosis of CMV-R, date of CMV-R relapse, type and duration of anti-CMV therapy, and duration of PI therapy. Relapse rates in subjects treated with PIs were compared with the relapse rates in those who were not treated with Pls. The primary endpoint was the time to relapse and death as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazard model. One hundred and nine cases of CMV-R were identified in 75 patients. Median follow-up time was 247 days (range 31-1818 days). There were 0.54 relapses per 1000 patient days in the group treated with Pls compared with 1.83 relapses per 1000 patient days in the non-PI treatment group (relative risk [RR]=0.29, P < 0.01). Time to relapse was increased in the PI treatment group compared with the non-PI treatment group (endpoint not reached vs 182 days, P < 0.001, log-rank). Similarly, the time to relapse or death was increased in the PI group compared with the non-PI group (543 days vs 103 days, P < 0.001, log-rank). Multivariate analysis utilizing the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that only PI therapy but not anti-CMV therapy was associated with decreased risk of CMV-R relapse or death. Only 3 patients with an undetectable HIV viral load and one patient with a CD4 count > 120 cells/mul had a relapse. We conclude that patients with CMV-R treated with HAART containing a PI have increased time to relapse and have prolonged survival.

AB The flood hydroclimatology of the Grand Forks flood of April 1997, the most costly flood on a per capita basis for a major metropolitan area in United States history, is analyzed in terms of the natural processes that control spring snowmelt flooding in the region. The geomorphological characteristics of the basin are reviewed, and an integrated assessment of the hydroclimatological conditions during the winter of 1996 to 1997 is presented to gain a real-world understanding of the physical basis of this catastrophic flood event. The Grand Forks flood resulted from the principal flood-producing factors occurring at either historic or extreme levels, or at levels conducive to severe flooding. Above normal fall precipitation increased the fall soil moisture storage and reduced the spring soil moisture storage potential. A concrete frost layer developed that effectively reduced the soil infiltration capacity to zero. Record snowfall totals and snow cover depths occurred across the basin because of the unusual persistence of a blocking high circulation pattern throughout the winter. A severe, late spring blizzard delayed the snowmelt season and replenished the snow cover to record levels for early April. This blizzard was followed by a sudden transition to an extreme late season thaw due to the abrupt breakdown of the blocking circulation pattern. The presence of river ice contributed to backwater effects and affected the timing of tributary inflows to the main stem of the Red River. Only the absence of spring rains prevented an even more catastrophic flood disaster from taking place, This paper contributes to our understanding of the flood hydroclimatology of catastrophic flood events in an unusual flood hazard region that possesses relatively flat terrain, a north-flowing river, and an annual peak discharge time series dominated by spring snowmelt floods.

AB The primary task of infancy and childhood is growth and development. The elegance and delicacy of the development of a human from conception through adolescence affords particular windows of vulnerability to environmental hazards. If this development is hampered, the likelihood of a healthy adulthood are dramatically decreased. Many different kinds of insults have the potential to damage these natural processes, potentially leading to lifetime harm. It is often impossible to repair damages that occur in childhood.

AB Escherichia coli strains producing a variant of Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), designated Stx2f, have been recently described in the stools of feral pigeons. During 1997-1998, 649 pigeons were trapped and examined in three different squares of Rome. Stool samples were collected from each bird and enrichment cultures were examined for the presence of Stx by the veto cell assay. Stx-producing E. coli (STEC) were isolated from the positive cultures and characterized by serotyping and PCR analysis of stx and other virulence-related genes. Stx was detected in 10.8% of the stool enrichment cultures. The percentage of positive birds did not differ significantly for the three flocks considered and the season of sample collection. Conversely. STEC carriage was significantly more frequent in young than in adult birds (17.9 versus 8.2%). None of the birds examined showed signs of disease. STEC strains were isolated from 30 of 42 Stx-positive cultures examined. All the strains produced Stx2f, and most of them possessed genes encoding for intimin and the cytolethal distending toxin (CLDT). Six serogroups were identified. but most of the isolates belonged to 045, 018ab, and 075. Molecular typing indicated that most of the isolates within a flock were clonally-related. This work confirms that pigeons represent a natural reservoir of STEC strains characterized by the production of the toxin variant Stx2f, and by the frequent presence of eae and cldt genes. Further work is needed to clarify whether these STEC may represent a cause of avian disease or even a potential health hazard for humans. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB Little is known about the time-to-first detection and the time difference (TD) between first parasitological and first serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma spp. infections under natural infection challenge in cattle. The objective of our study was to estimate these measures of "longitudinal aspects" of diagnostic performance and to investigate potential biological factors. Emphasis was on diagnosis at the genus level (Trypanosoma spp.). Twelve N'Dama, 12 Gobra zebu and 12 N'Dama x Gobra (Fl) crossbred cattle (all animals non-infected at the start of the experiment, six male and six female animals in each cohort) were exposed to natural high tsetse challenge in the Niamina East area in The Gambia [Acta Trop. 71 (1998) 57]. The animals were investigated parasitologically (detection of trypanosomes by buffy-coat technique), serologically (detection of T brucei, T congolense and T vivax antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) and clinically (packed-cell volume, PCV) over a period of 180 days. The time-to-first detection of trypanosomes, trypanosomal antigen (cut-off as suggested by test supplier) and drop in PCV (subject-based cut-off values) were recorded as outcomes of interest. Thus, incidence was both parasitologically (I-p), serologically (I-s) and clinically (I-c). Recurrent events were not considered. The TD between first parasitological and first serological detection was established as I-s time minus I-p time. The effect of breed and sex on the time-to-first detection and on TD was investigated using Cox (proportional hazard) regression and ANOVA, respectively.
   We found that time-to-first parasitological detection of trypanosomosis in N'Dama animals was significantly longer than in the two other breeds (Cox regression, P = 0.002). A similar but less-strong (P = 0.063) effect of breed on time-to-first detection of trypanosomal. antigen was found, whereas no breed effect was observed for clinical detection (P = 0.432). Sex had no effect in all detection systems. The TD varied between -56 and 115 (mean 28). Marked differences among breeds and between sexes were not observed (ANOVA, P = 0.8). We suggest that incidence studies are more suitable for detecting risk factors for animal trypanosomosis than prevalence-based (cross-sectional) studies because the latter often result in misinterpretation of factors that increase the survival time with infection as risk factors.

AB It is hypothesized that the extent and severity of fibrosis and cellularity found on lung biopsy determine the prognosis and response to therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The objective of this study was to determine which histopathologic features predict survival in IPF. We prospectively studied 87 patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) confirmed by surgical lung biopsy. Four pathologists independently graded the extent and severity of specific histopathologic features. We used Cox proportional-hazards models to assess the effect of histopathologic patterns on patients' survival, The effects of age, sex, and smoking were also included in the analysis. Sixty-three patients died during the 17-yr study period. Survival was longer in subjects with lesser degrees of granulation/connective tissue deposition (fibroblastic foci). The degree of alveolar space cellularity, alveolar wall fibrosis, and cellularity did not affect survival. A history of cigarette smoking, the level of dyspnea, and the degree of lung stiffness at presentation were also shown to be independent factors predicting survival. The extent of fibroblastic foci present on lung biopsy predicts survival in IPF. These findings support the hypothesis that the critical pathway to end-stage fibrosis is not "alveolitis" but rather the ongoing epithelial damage and repair process associated with persistent fibroblastic proliferation. Controlling these processes, rather than stopping inflammation, appears most important in preventing progressive disease and the fatal outcome common in IPF.

AB This paper discusses the rational exploitation of main resources and prevention of geohazards in karst regions. There exist relationship chains between natural disasters in the earth, which include the chain between geological hazards and climatic hazards, the chain between geological hazards and biogenic hazards as well as the one between geological hazards. Irrational exploitation of all resources will inevitably cause hazards. Therefore it is very important to discuss the problem related to prevention of geohazards by rational exploitation of resources.

AB The study of the palaoseismic events in the karst terrains of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast is a very important up-to-date problem. The investigated region is one of the highest-energy regions in Bulgaria with established and recorded catastrophic historic and contemporary earthquakes. The terrain is subjected to the influence not only of its own earthquake foci but also of those in Romania and Russia. The palaeoearthquakes that caused considerable disturbances in the karst terrains along the Northern Bulgarian Black Sea coast have left significant traces. They caused disturbances in the environment and the relief (rearrangement of the surface and ground water karst basins, partially or entirely collapsed caves, deformed caves, oil, gas and salt intrusions and gravitationally formed caves). The ecological consequences in historic and contemporary aspects were catastrophic. The palaeoseismic dislocations were formed as a result of global, regional and local geodynamic events related with the destruction of the Moezian platform and the regional extension of the Black Sea basin. The time of their display and their spatial interrelations were established as a result of complex investigations accompanied by original documents.

DE karst; ecosystem; Vietnam
AB Karst in Vietnam covers an area of about 60,000 km(2), i.e. 18 % of the surface of the country. The country has an annual average temperature of 24 degreesC, an annual average rainfall of 2300 nun and a relative humidity of about 90%. Karst in Vietnam is typified by peak cluster-depression landscapes ranging in elevation from 200 to over 2000 m. Tower and coastal karst landscapes also exit. Because of naturally favourable conditions, karst ecosystems are diverse and very rich. Higher plants(cormophytes) are abundant. They are represented by approximately 2000 species, 908 genera, 224 families, 86 orders and 7 phyla. They form a thick vegetation cover of evergreen tropical rainforest. Knowledge about lower plants is limited. The fauna is rich and diverse. Phyla such as Protozoa, Vermes, Mollusca and Arthropoda are yet ill known. Preliminary results show that the phylum Chordata is represented by 541 species from 80 families, 40 orders and 5 classes. There exist many precious and rare mammals, in particular some endemic species such as Trachypithecus poliocephalus, T. delacouri, Rhinopithecus avanculus, Rhinolophus rouxi, Seotoma dineties and Silurus cuephuongensis. The class Insecta has about 2000 species.
   The fast population growth, particularly in the mountainous areas of the country, triggers an increasing demand for land and therefore threatens the ecosystem. To obtain land for farming, people have cut, burned and destroyed natural forest cover; resulting in occurrence of hazards such as soil-loss, water-loss, flash floods, mud-rock flows, rock-falls, severe drought, water logging and changes of karstic aquifers etc. Poaching precious animals and illegal logging are increasing. In contrast to other natural systems, karst ecosystems cannot be reestablished once damaged. Living karst landscapes will become rocky desert ones without life. Conservation of karstic environmental systems in general and karstic ecosystems in particular should not be the sole vocation of scientists but also a duty and responsibility of authorities and people from all levels. A good example of a multidisciplinary approach to karst-related problems is the implementation of the Vietnamese-Belgian Karst Project (VBEKAP): "Rural development in the mountain karst area of NW Vietnam by sustainable water and land management and social learning: its conditions and facilitation". The aim of this project is to improve living conditions of local people and sustained protection and management of the karst environment and ecosystem.

TI Challenges of subgroup analyses in multinational clinical trials:
   Experiences from the MERIT-HF trial
SO AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; MORTALITY
AB Background International placebo-controlled survival trials (Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomised Intervention Trial in Heart Failure [MERIT-HF], Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study [CIBIS-II], and Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival trial [COPERNICUS]) evaluating the effects of P-blockade in patients with heart failure have all demonstrated highly significant positive effects on total mortality as well as total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization. Also, the analysis of the US Carvedilol Program indicated an effect on these end points. Although none of these trials are large enough to provide definitive results in any particular subgroup, it is natural for physicians to examine the consistency of results across various subgroups or risk groups. Our purpose was to examine both predefined and post hoc subgroups in the MERIT-HF trial to provide guidance as to whether any subgroup is of increased risk, despite an overall strongly positive effect, and to discuss the difficulties and limitations in conducting such subgroup analyses.
   Methods The study was conducted at 313 clinical sites in 16 randomization regions across 14 countries, with a total of 3991 patients. Total mortality (first primary end point) and total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (second primary end point) were analyzed on a time to first event. The first secondary end point was total mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure.
   Results Overall, MERIT-HF demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.66 for total mortality and 0.81 for mortality plus all-cause hospitalization. The hazard ratio of the first secondary end point of mortality plus hospitalization for heart failure was 0.69. The results were remarkably consistent for both primary outcomes and the first secondary outcome across all predefined subgroups as well as for nearly all post hoc subgroups. The results of the post hoc US subgroup showed a mortality hazard ratio of 1.05. However, the US results regarding both the second primary combined outcome of total mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of the first secondary combined outcome of total mortality plus heart failure hospitalization were in concordance with the overall results of MERIT-HF. Tests of country by treatment interaction (14 countries) revealed a nonsignificant P value of .22 for total mortality. The mortality hazard ratio for US patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV was 0.80, and it was 2.24 for patients in NYHA class II, which is not consistent with causality by biologic gradient. We have not been able to identify any confounding factor in baseline characteristics, baseline treatment, or treatment during follow-up that could account for any treatment by country interaction. Thus we attribute the US subgroup mortality hazard ratio to be due to chance.
   Conclusions Just as we must be extremely cautious in overinterpreting positive effects in subgroups, even those that are predefined, we must also be cautious in focusing on subgroups with an apparent neutral or negative trend. We should examine subgroups to obtain a general sense of consistency, which is clearly the case in MERIT-HF. We should expect some variation of the treatment effect around the overall estimate as we examine a large number of subgroups because of small sample size in subgroups and chance. Thus the best estimate of the treatment effect on total mortality for any subgroup is the estimate of the hazard ratio for the overall trial.

AB To assess the long-term health consequences of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the authors compared cause-specific mortality rates of 621,902 Gulf War veterans with those of 746,248 non-Gulf veterans, by gender, with adjustment for age, race, marital status, branch of service, and type of unit. Vital status follow-up began with the date of exit from the Persian Gulf theater (Gulf veterans) or May 1, 1991 (control veterans). Follow-up for both groups ended on the date of death or December 31, 1997, whichever came first. Cox proportional hazards models were used for the multivariate analysis. For Gulf veterans, mortality risk was also assessed relative to the likelihood of exposure to nerve gas at Khamisiyah, Iraq. Among Gulf veterans, the significant excess of deaths due to motor vehicle accidents that was observed during the earlier postwar years had decreased steadily to levels found in non-Gulf veterans. The risk of death from natural causes remained lower among Gulf veterans compared with non-Gulf veterans. This was mainly accounted for by the relatively higher number of deaths related to human immunodeficiency virus infection among non-Gulf veterans. There was no statistically significant difference in cause-specific mortality among Gulf veterans relative to potential nerve gas exposure. The risk of death for both Gulf veterans and non-Gulf veterans stayed less than half of that expected in their civilian counterparts. The authors conclude that the excess risk of mortality from motor vehicle accidents that was associated with Gulf War service has dissipated after 7 years of follow-up.

AB Objective In view of the fact that asbestos is not only a key occupational hazard, but also an important environmental pollutant, it is necessary to develop a proper method to decrease the carcinogenecity of asbestos fibers. This study was designed to determine if the surface modification of chrysotile asbestos fiber (CAF) with rare earth compounds (REC) can ameliorate CAF-induced DNA damages in human embryo lung (HEL) cells. Methods After incubation with REC solution at different concentrations at mom temperature for 1 h, natural and REC-pretreated CAF was added to cell culture at various doses. At the selected time as the experiment designed, DNA damages of the HEL cells were detected by Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) and Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE) assays. Results The UDS induced by natural CAF was elevated with the increase of CAF doses. There was a good dose-response relationship between the UDS and the amount of CAF in the medium and the coefficient of correlation (R) was 0.958 at P < 0.05. In REC-pretreated CAF groups, the UDS declined with the increase of REC doses. Both catalase (CAT) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) also reduced the CAF-induced enhancement of UDS. In SCGE assay, CAF induced DNA chain breakage and the magnitude of DNA chain breakage increased in a dose-dependent manner and the coefficient of correlation (R) was 0.992 at p < 0.01, while REC-pretreated CAF significantly decreased the induction of DNA chain breakage in a dose-dependent manner(r = 0.989, P < 0.05). Conclusion It can be concluded that CAF-induced DNA damages in HEL cells may be partly mediated by oxygen derivatives, and the surface modification of CAF with REC might hide critical sites on the fiber surface, thereby reducing the fiber-mediated production of oxygen derivation and lowering the CAF-induced UDS and DNA chain breakage in HEL cells.

AB A cooperative research center based in Townsville, Australia, has completed almost 6 yrs of applied and strategic research, education, and extension in support of conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. One cornerstone of its success has been the involvement of scientists, representatives from industry, and managers in project development, conduct. and knowledge transfer. Another cornerstone is its interdisciplinary mix of research themes: socioeconomic, technological, and biophysical. We are documenting where, when. and how people currently perceive, use, and benefit from the World Heritage Area and its resources, and how these may change under various future scenarios. We are seeking cost-effective ways for users to meet regulations on structures and wastewater and ballast-water disposal intended to protect the environment. This is done through a combination of critical assessments of the perceived hazard and development of guidelines that reflect that hazard. We are working to evaluate our network of no-take areas in terms of capacity to protect biodiversity and enhance regional fish stocks. We are commencing a parallel socioeconomic impact assessment to took at the effects of different options for closures on fishing communities. Since we will never be able to do biodiversity surveys over more than a small percentage of the entire World Heritage Area, we are developing geographic and physical surrogates to help define 'bioregions' to support planning for the distribution and size of no-take zones. We are linking with catchment scientists to assess the extent of cumulative and individual extreme runoff events. We are using spatial risk-assessment tools to map risks and return periods of impact on coral reefs by unmanageable and/or natural impacts such as floods, cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish, One of the major lessons learned has been that the involvement of research users in the research process has improved 'ownership' of the results of the research, and thus its capacity to effect social change in policy and management areas.

AB A geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning often requires a large amount of spatial information. Geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related information, providing the ability to integrate multiple layers of information and to derive additional information. A GIS-aid to the geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning is illustrated for the urban area of Lanzhou City and its vicinity in Northwest China. This evaluation incorporates topography, surficial and bedrock geology, groundwater conditions, and historic geologic hazards. Urban land-use is categorized according to the types of land-use and projects planned, such as high-rise building, multi-storey building, low-rise building, waste disposal, and natural conservation. Multi-criteria analysis is performed to evaluate development suitability of the geo-environment for each category, according to appropriately measured and weighted factors. A suitability map for each category is developed using an algorithm that combines factors in weighted linear combinations. It is demonstrated that the GIS methodology has high functionality for geo-environmental assessment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine whether children with homozygous sickle cell anemia (SCD) who have silent infarcts on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain are at increased risk for overt stroke.
   Methods: We selected patients with homozygous SCD who (1) enrolled in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) before age 6 months, (2) had at least I study-mandated brain MRI at age 6 years or older, and (3) had no overt stroke before a first MRI. MRI results and clinical and laboratory parameters were tested as predictors of stroke.
   Results: Among 248 eligible patients, mean age at first MRI was 8.3 +/- 1.9 years, and mean follow-up after baseline MRI was 5.2 +/- 2.2 years. Five (8.1%) of 62 patients with silent infarct had strokes compared with 1 (0.5%) of 186 patients without prior silent infarct; incidence per 100 patient-years of follow-up was increased 14-fold (1.45 per 100 patient-years vs 0.11 per 100 patient-years, P = .006). Of several clinical and laboratory parameters examined, silent infarct was the strongest independent predictor of stroke (hazard ratio = 7.2, P = .0277).
   Conclusions: Silent infarct identified at age 6 years or older is associated with increased stroke risk.

AB Surface deposits of the Tuttle Canyon alluvial fan, eastern Sierra Nevada piedmont, California, mainly accumulated during a catastrophic outburst flood probably triggered by the failure of a moraine-dammed lake in the steep (16.4 degrees), high-relief (2361 m), and high-elevation (to 4275 m) catchment. Moraines of the catchment and upper fan (Facies A) comprise unsorted sand to blocks derived from the granitic bedrock. The main flood facies (B) is texturally like the moraine, consisting of unsorted, matrix-supported,sandy pebbly cobbly blocky boulder gravel in a single unit 3 to 8+ m thick distributed across most of the 10.5 km long and 28.1 km(2) fan. Facies B was deposited during the initial outburst-flood phase as a high-volume, noncohesive sediment gravity flow (NCSGF) instigated by water rapidly descending over moraine. It differs from the moraine by a planar unit geometry and a slope-transverse long-axis alignment of boulders. NCSGF deposition was followed by a water-flood phase caused by continued lake drainage subsequent to removal of loose sediment in the flood path. This discharge carved channels 2-22 m deep and 5-60 m wide around and across fan NCSGF deposits, with channels departing from various points along Tuttle Creek. Horseshoe separation scours also formed around bedrock spurs, and laminated pebbly sand accumulated on the channel beds (Facies D). Flood discharge expanded on the distal fan into a sheetflood that first deposited a boulder unit (Facies E), and then 4+ In of cobbly sandy pebble gravel in planar beds 5-20 cm thick (Facies F). The final flood phase entailed incision of Tuttle Creek, wherein bouldery cobble gravel (Facies C) was concentrated. Post-flood modification of these deposits has been limited to secondary processes such as eolian deposition (Facies G) and bioturbation.
   Outburst floods on fans of the Sierra Nevada piedmont ultimately are caused by the glacial transfer of colluvium from the upper catchment slopes into moraines on the valley floors that dam drainage to form lakes. Outburst floods differ from meteorological floods in the valley by the high water and sediment discharge achieved during a single event, by deposition of massive NCSGF beds, and by causing major changes to the landscape such as the carving of channels. These differences produce fans with distinctive facies and hazards, the former allowing their recognition in either modern or ancient settings.

AB I examine a principal-agent model with multiple projects where a risk-neutral manager is protected by limited liability. The analysis has several interesting implications: (i) Incentive problems are shown to be a natural source of economies of scope, as combining multiple projects under the management of a single manager relaxes the limited-liability constraint. (ii) As a result, managers may be overloaded with work and exert inefficiently high effort. (iii) The analysis has implications,for the optimal allocation of projects to different managers.

AB Background-Permanent smoking cessation reduces loss of pulmonary function. Less is known in the long term about individuals who give up smoking temporarily or quitters with lower initial pulmonary function. Little is known also about the relationship between decline in pulmonary function and mortality. We examined these aspects and the association between smoking, decline in pulmonary function, and mortality.
   Methods-Two middle aged male Finnish cohorts of the Seven Countries Study and their re-examinations on five occasions during a 30 year period of follow up were analysed.
   Results-During the first 15 years (n=1007) adjusted decline in forced expiratory volume in 0.75 seconds (FEV0.75) was 46.4 ml/year in never smokers, 49.3 ml/year in past smokers, 55.5 ml/year in permanent quitters, 55.5 ml/year in intermittent quitters, and 66.0 ml/year in continuous smokers (p <0.001 for trend). Quitters across the entire range of baseline FEV0.75 had a slower decline in FEV0.75 than continuous smokers. Among both continuing smokers and never smokers, non-survivors had a significantly (p <0.001) more rapid decline in FEV0.75 than survivors. The adjusted relative hazard for total mortality was 1.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 2.11) and 1.24 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.52) in the lowest and middle tertiles of decline in FEV0.75. Never smokers, past smokers, and quitters had significantly lower total mortality than continuous smokers, partly because of their slower decline in FEV0.75.
   Conclusion-These results highlight the positive effect of smoking cessation, even intermittent cessation, on decline in pulmonary function. Accelerated decline in pulmonary function was found to be a risk factor for total mortality. The beneficial effect of smoking cessation on mortality may partly be mediated through a reduced decline in pulmonary function.

AB Background and objectives-To examine the long term impact of workplace smoking bans on employee smoking cessation and relapse. Over three years we studied a total of 1033 current or former smokers (intervention group) employed in smoke-free hospitals and 816 current or former smokers (comparison group) employed in non-smoke-free workplaces. The design of this natural experiment is a prospective cohort study. We randomly selected both hospitals and employees from 12 strata based on hospital size and state tobacco regulations, and sampled employees in the same communities. Main outcome measures were post-ban quit ratio and relapse rate.
   Research design-Between groups comparisons were conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic for general association, stratified Cox proportional hazards models, and the CMH analysis of variance statistic based on ranks. McNemar's test and the sign test were used to test for changes over time within each group.
   Results-Differences in the post-ban quit ratio were observed between intervention and comparison groups (p less than or equal to 0.02). For employees whose bans were implemented at least seven years before survey, the post-ban quit ratio was estimated at 0.256, compared with 0.142 for employees in non-smoke-free workplaces (p = 0.02). After controlling for a variety of factors, time to quit smoking was shorter for the hospital employees (p < 0.001), with an overall relative risk of quitting of 2.3. Contrary to expectations, relapse rates were similar between the groups.
   Conclusion-Employees in workplaces with smoking bans have higher rates of smoking cessation than employees where smoking is permitted, but relapse is similar between these two groups of employees. The results of this investigation have international applicability for policy makers, clinicians, employers, and employees. Countries should review smoking policies in workplaces in light of their own smoking patterns and efforts to deal with environmental tobacco smoke.

AB This paper presents the first data on the identification, characterization and quantification of microcystins isolated from both an extract of a cyanobacteria natural bloom, collected from a eutrophic Moroccan reservoir (Lalla Takerkoust, Marrakesh) and an isolated strain cultivated under laboratory conditions. The isolation and purification of toxins was performed by reverse phase HPLC and then characterized by amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). Chemical characterization of the toxins from the bloom revealed variants of microcystins such as Mcyst-LR, Mcyst-RR, Mcyst-YR and [D-Asp(3)]Mcyst-LR. However, the Microcystis aeruginosa strain produced only Mcyst-RR. Using an ELISA assay the total microcystin contents of eight bloom samples collected from 1994 to 1997 ranged from 0.7 to 8.8 mug/mg of lyophilized material. The two isolated Microcystis strains contained higher amounts of microcystins (0.65 mug/mg of dry weight) than the Pseudanabaena strains (0.021 mug/mg of dry weight). Our results show that the presence of cyanobacteria toxins in water used for drinking in a North African country may be regarded as an health hazard. These results are a contribution to the knowledge of the biogeography of toxic cyanobacteria and their toxins, namely in north African countries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the impact of response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the natural history of AIDS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and to analyse the feasibility, efficacy and toxicity of HAART in combination with chemotherapy.
   Design: Prospective observational study in two AIDS clinical centres in Italy.
   Methods: All consecutive HIV-infected patients with NHL were included (n = 44; 48% high-risk group) and prospectively followed for 27 months. HAART was administered concomitantly with chemotherapy. The association between response to HAART and clinical presentation, response to chemotherapy and toxicity was analysed by univariate and multivariate models. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier estimates and the Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   Results: A complete response (CR) to chemotherapy was achieved in 71% of HAART responders and 30% of non-responders. Virological response to HAART was the only variable associated with tumour response on multivariate analysis. A higher relative dose intensity (RDI) of chemotherapy was administered in patients with virological response compared with those without. The probability of 1 year survival was higher in patients with virological or immunological response. At Cox regression analysis, immunological response, a higher RDI and a CIR to chemotherapy were all associated with a reduced risk of death.
   Conclusion: In HIV-infected patients with NHL, response to HAART was strongly associated with a better response to chemotherapy and prolonged survival. Concurrent treatments were well tolerated, and HAART-responder patients could receive a higher RDI of chemotherapy. In patients with AIDS lymphomas, combining HAART with chemotherapy could be a feasible and effective approach. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI Prognostic factors analysis of 17,600 melanoma patients: Validation of

AB Purpose: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) recently proposed major revisions of the tumor-node-metastases (TNM) categories and stage groupings for cutaneous melanoma. Thirteen cancer centers and cancer cooperative groups contributed staging and survival data from a total of 30,450 melanoma patients from their databases in order to validate this staging proposal.
   Patients and Methods: There were 17,600 melanoma patients with complete clinical, pathologic, and follow-up information. Factors predicting melanoma-specific survival rates were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Follow-up survival data for 5 years or longer were available for 73% of the patients.
   Results: This analysis demonstrated that (1) in the T category, tumor thickness and ulceration were the most powerful predictors of survival, and the level of invasion had a significant impact only within the subgroup of thin (less than or equal to 1 mm) melanomas; (2) in the N category, the following three independent factors were identified: the number of metastatic nodes, whether nodal metastases were clinically occult or clinically apparent, and the presence or absence of primary tumor ulceration; and (3) in the M category, nonvisceral metastases was associated with a better survival compared with visceral metastases. A marked diversity in the natural history of pathologic stage III melanoma was demonstrated by five-fold differences in 5-year survival rates for defined subgroups. This analysis also demonstrated that large and complex data sets could be used effectively to examine prognosis and survival outcome in melanoma patients.
   Conclusion: The results of this evidence-based methodology were incorporated into the AJCC melanoma staging as described in the companion publication.

AB Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts. Despite the recognition of immunological and genetic alterations cited as factors in its pathogenesis, the exact cause for PSC remains unknown. Observational cohort studies, however, have demonstrated that PSC is a progressive disease culminating in liver failure or death. Natural history assessment in PSC, however, has been complicated by variable rates of disease progression and the impact of clinical symptoms upon initial presentation. The development of mathematical models by multivariable regression techniques (most notably Cox proportional hazards regression) has allowed for an improved description of overall survival on an individual basis among patients with PSC. Additionally, these models have also been employed for determining the optimal selection and timing for liver transplantation when advanced disease is imminent.

AB Hazardous explosive activity may sporadically accompany the extrusion of silicic lava domes. Modelling of the emplacement of silicic domes is therefore an important task for volcanic hazard assessment. Such modelling has been hampered by a lack of a sufficiently accurate rheological database for silicic lavas with crystals and vesicles. In the present study, the parallel-plate viscometry method was applied to determine the shear viscosity of five natural rhyolitic samples from a vertical section through the Ben Lomond lava dome, Taupo Volcanic Centre, New Zealand. Rheological measurements were performed at volcanologically relevant temperatures (780-950 degreesC) and strain rates (10(-5)-10(-7) s(-1)). Although these samples are in the metastable state, viscosity determinations, melt composition, as well as water and crystal contents of samples were demonstrably stable during experiments. For samples containing up to 5 vol.% microlites, the composition of the melt, rather than the physical effect of suspended crystals, had greater influence on the effective viscosity of the silicic magma. Samples with 10 vol.% microlites and containing a flow banding defined by microlites show no significant orientational effects on apparent viscosity. The rheological measurements were used together with a simple cooling model to construct thermal and viscosity profiles revealing conditions during the emplacement of the Ben Lomond lava dome.

AB The purpose of this study is to reveal the role of cupric ions as a natural water contaminant in the H2O2/UV oxidation of humic acids. Humic acids are naturally occurring organic matter and exhibit a strong tendency of complexation with some transition metal ions. Chlorination of humic acids causes potential health hazards due to formation of trihalomethane (THM). The removal of THM precursors has become an issue of public concern. The H2O2/UV process is capable of mineralizing humic acids due to formation of a strong oxidant, hydroxyl radicals, in reaction solution. Experiments were conducted in a re-circulated photoreactor. Different cupric concentrations (0-3.8 mg/l) and different pH values (4-9) were controlled to determine their effects on the degradation of humic acids, I-TV light absorbance at 254 nm, and H2O2. The presence of cupric ions inhibits humic mineralization and decreases the rate of destruction of humic acids which absorb UV light at 254 mn. On the other hand, the higher the cupric concentration, the lower the H2O2 decomposition rate. In the studied pH range, the minimum of total organic carbon (TOC) removal occurs at pH = 6 in the presence of 2.6 mg/l of cupric ions; both acidification (pH = 4) and alkaline condition (pH = 9) lead to a better removal of TOC. It is inferred from this study that the cupric-complexed form of humic acids is more refractory than the non-complexed one. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

AB Women with type I diabetes have a delayed menarche and a greater prevalence of menstrual disorders than women without diabetes. However, little is known about the menopause transition among type I diabetic women. The Familial Autoimmune and Diabetes (FAD) Study recruited both adult individuals who were identified from the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Type 1 Diabetes Registry for the years 1950-1964 and their family members. Unrelated nondiabetic control probands and their relatives were also evaluated. Women with type I diabetes (n = 143) compared with nondiabetic sisters (n = 186) or unrelated control subjects (n = 160) were more likely to have an older age at menarche (13.5, 12.5, and 12.6 years, respectively, P < 0.001), more menstrual irregularities before 30 years of age (45.7, 33.3, and 33.1%, respectively, P = 0.04), and a younger age at menopause (41.6, 49.9, and 48.0 years, respectively, P = 0.05). This resulted in a 6-year reduction in the number of reproductive years (30.0, 37.0, and 35.2 years, respectively, P = 0.05) for women with type 1 diabetes. Risk factors univariately associated with earlier menopause included type 1 diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, P = 0.04), menstrual irregularities before 30 years of age (HR 1.87, P = 0.04), nulliparity (HR 2.14, P = 0.01), and unilateral oophorectomy (HR 6.51, P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that type I diabetes (HR 1.98, P = 0.056), menstrual irregularities by 30 years of age (HR 2.36, P = 0.01), and unilateral oophorectomy (HR 9.76, P < 0.0001) were independent determinants of earlier menopause in our cohort. We hypothesize that an earlier menopause, which resulted in a 17% decrease in reproductive years, is a major unstudied complication of type 1 diabetes.

AB The aim was to establish mortality rates in a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 10 years in Canterbury, New Zealand (NZ) and to determine baseline prognostic factors. Subjects (447) with type 2 diabetes (208 male, 239 female; age range 30-82 years, median 62 years; of predominantly European origin) were characterised in a clinic survey in 1989. individual status (dead or alive) at June 1 1999(10 year follow-up) was ascertained. Mortality rates were compared with the general NZ population and the relative risk (RR) of baseline prognostic factors evaluated with Cox's proportional hazards model. At 10 years, 232 subjects were confirmed as alive and 187 as dead-only 28 were untraceable. Ten year survival was 55% (95% CI: 50-60) for the cohort, compared with 70% (95% CI: 65-75) at 6 years. Factors assessed at baseline (1989), that were independently prognostic of total mortality, included age (RR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.6-2.5), pre-existing coronary artery disease (CAD; RR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.4) and albuminuria (RR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.1 2.3). Glycated haemoglobin was not a significant predictor of total mortality, although was a predictor of CAD mortality in those subjects free of CAD in 1989 (RR 1.6. 95% CI: 1.1-2.3). In the latter subset, independent prognostic factors for CAD mortality also included age (RR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.7-3.8), hypertension (RR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.0-3.7), peripheral vascular disease (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.5) and smoking (RR 2.6, 95% CI: 1.7-5.8). Increased mortality in type 2 diabetic subjects is therefore attributable to multiple risk factors. Improved outcomes will depend on interventions targeted at glycaemic and all other remediable factors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dewatering associated with mining in the gold-bearing reefs of the Far West Rand, which underlie dolomite and unconsolidated deposits, led to the formation of sinkholes and subsidence depressions. Hence, certain areas became unsafe for occupation and were evacuated. Although sinkholes were initially noticed in the 1950s, the seriousness of the situation was highlighted in December 1962 when a sinkhole engulfed a three-story crusher plant at West Driefontein Mine. Consequently, it became a matter of urgency that the areas at risk of subsidence and the occurrence of sinkholes were delineated. Sinkholes formed concurrently with the lowering of the water table in areas which formerly had been relatively free of sinkholes. In addition, subsidence occurred as a consequence of consolidation taking place in the unconsolidated deposits as the water table was lowered. In the latter case, the degree of subsidence which occurred reflected the thickness and original density of the unconsolidated deposits which were consolidated. These deposits vary laterally in thickness and thereby gave rise to differential subsidence. Subsidence also occurred due to the closure of dewatered voids at the rock-soil interface.
   The risk of sinkhole and subsidence occurrence is increased by urban development, since interrupted natural surface drainage, increased runoff, and leakage from water-bearing utilities can result in the concentrated ingress of water into the ground. Where the surficial deposits are less permeable, the risk of instability is reduced. In the area underlain by dolomite, which extends around Johannesburg and Pretoria, these problem have been more notable in recent years because of housing development, both low-cost and up-market, and the growth of informal settlements. Residential densities may be very high, especially for low-cost housing, the development of which frequently has proceeded without recognition of the risk posed by karst-related ground instability. The appearance of significant numbers of small sinkholes has been associated with dolomite at shallow depth, that is, occurring at less than 15 m beneath the ground surface. The vulnerability of an area overlying dolomite bedrock at shallow depth is largely dependent on the spacing, width and continuity of grikes. When dolomite is located at depths greater than 15 m, the sinkholes which appear at the surface usually are larger in diameter. The risk of sinkhole occurrence in areas of shallow dolomite in general, may be greater, although the hazard itself is less severe. A classification system for the evaluation of dolomitic land based on the risk of formation of certain sized sinkholes has enabled such land to be zoned for appropriate development. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance of water bearing services, and the implementation of precautionary measures relating to drainage and infiltration of surface water are regarded as essential in developed areas underlain by dolomite. Special types of foundation construction for structures are frequently necessary.

AB BACKGROUND: We investigated the hypothesis that long-term use of oral contraceptives (OCs), in particular high-dose OCs, could postpone age at menopause. METHODS: Data was used from 8701 women who participated in a breast cancer screening programme in Utrecht (DOM-3 cohort), and who did not use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or OCs in the 4 years prior to their last menses. Data on OC-use, menopausal status, age at menopause, year of birth, parity, smoking behaviour, socio-economic status, body mass index and age at menarche was available. Use of high-dose OCs has been defined in this study as OC-use before 1972. The data was analysed by means of linear regression and Cox's proportional hazards analysis. Women still menstruating, women with surgical menopause and women lost to follow-up were censored at their last known date of menstruation. Endpoint was the natural menopause (n = 4589). RESULTS: The use of high-dose OCs advanced the onset of menopause by similar to1.2 months for every year of OC-use compared with no OC-use. High-dose OC-use for greater than or equal to3 years, adjusted for confounding variables, increased the risk of earlier menopause compared with no OC-use (adjusted hazard ratio 1.12; 95% CI 1.03-1.21). The use of lower dose OCs did not increase the risk of earlier menopause (adjusted hazard ratio 1.00; 95% CI 0.91-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that long-term use of OCs could postpone the onset of menopause by inhibiting follicle depletion. Possible explanations are discussed.

TI A spatio-temporal GIS database for monitoring alpine glacier change

DT Article
AB Monitoring alpine glacier change has many practical and scientific benefits, including yielding information on glacier-fed water supplies, glacier-associated natural hazards, and climate variability. This paper describes the design and implementation of a spatio-temporal GIS database for monitoring glacier geometry and geometric change. The temporal component of the glacier data is managed through both a "snapshot" and time-normalization approach to the relational data model in which glacier properties are organized according to their spatial and temporal dependencies. Because of the integration of diverse historic and contemporary data sources, metadata play a key role in managing data quality. For the initial population of the database, historic and contemporary map data on six glaciers on Mount Rainier, Washington were used to model glacier geometry and were examined for geometric change over the period 1913-1971.

AB A risk analysis was performed to examine the effect of changes in the Dutch greenhouse sector on the probability of occurrence and magnitude of indemnities induced by catastrophic natural hazards. Analyzed historical indemnities, which included direct and consequential losses resulting from severe hail and windstorms, were used as input in a stochastic simulation model. Applications of the stochastic simulation model were illustrated under alternative risk conditions. A comparison was made between the current structure of greenhouse production and the expected structure in the next decade that differs with respect to the spatial distribution and average size.

AB Background: An improvement of prognostic models in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is needed. In particular, inclusion of prognostic markers that are independent of the disease stage would be advantageous. We investigated whether HLA class II genes associated with PSC are also related to disease progression. Methods: Tnt: study included 265 PSC patients from five European countries with a median follow-up of 9.1 years. The end-points were death (n = 38) or liver transplantation (n = 52). Thirty patients developed cholangiocarcinoma during follow-up. Results: The DRB1*03,DQA1*0501, DQB1*02 (i.e. DR3,DQ2) heterozygous genotype was associated with an increased risk of death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.06-2.52). The presence of a DQ6 encoding haplotype (DQB1*0603 or DQB1*0602) in DR3,DQ? negative individuals was associated with a reduced risk of death or liver transplantation (hazard ratio = 0.57: 95% CI = 0.36-0.88). There was a trend towards an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma among DR4,DQ8 positive patients, but this did not reach significance (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% CI = 0.78-6.62). Conclusion: The DR3,DQ?, heterozygous genotype is associated with a more rapid progression of PSC, whereas HLA-DQ6 is associated with a retarded disease progression. It is possible that the DR-l,DQ8 haplotype is related to cholangiocarcinoma development.

AB We investigate various ways of statistically estimating multifractal fields from sparse data. First, the problem is set in the general framework of conditional expectations, and the effect of (multi) fractal sampling on the statistics of the measured process is investigated, showing how analytical expressions describing the statistical properties of the phenomenon should be modified by the sampling. Then, several techniques are introduced, our goal being to estimate the intensity of a field at resolution lambda, given samples of the process collected by networks at higher resolutions Lambda > lambda. The general strategy underlying all the estimating techniques presented is to approximate the unknown field values at resolution lambda by means of most likely estimates conditional to the available information at resolution Lambda > lambda. Finally, the procedures are tested on simulated lognormal multifractal fields sampled by means of fractal networks, and the propagation of the errors in a scaling framework is also discussed. These techniques are necessary for estimating geophysical processes in regions where no monitoring stations are present, a scenario often encountered in practice, and may also be of great help in studying natural hazards and risk assessment.

AB During the last decade an hypothesis has been developed linking certain chemicals (natural and synthetic) to observed and suspected adverse effects on reproduction in both wildlife and humans. The issue of 'endocrine disruption' originally focused on chemicals that mimic the action of the natural hormone oestrogen. However, the concern is now encompassing effects on the whole endocrine system. In response to public awareness, regulatory agencies (including the US EPA) and the OECD are formulating potential testing strategies and have begun the process of validating defined tests to systematically assess chemicals for their endocrine-disrupting activities. In order to investigate chemicals that have the potential to cause endocrine disruption, a large number of in vitro and in vivo assays have been identified. In vitro test systems (particularly when used in combination) offer the possibility of providing an early screen for large numbers of chemicals and can be useful in characterising the mechanism of action and potency. In vitro assays in widespread use for the screening/characterisation of endocrine disrupting potential include hormone receptor ligand binding assays (determination of the ability of a chemical to bind to the hormone receptor), cell proliferation assays (analysis of the ability of a chemical to stimulate growth of oestrogen sensitive cells), reporter gene assays in yeast or mammalian cells (analysis of the ability of a chemical to stimulate the transcription of a reporter gene construct in cell culture), and the analysis of the regulation of endogenous oestrogen sensitive genes in cell lines. However, in vitro assays do not always reliably predict the outcome in vivo due to differences in metabolic capabilities of the test systems used and the diverse range of mechanisms by which endocrine disrupting chemicals may act. Therefore a complementary battery of short- and long-term in vitro and in vivo assays (that assess both receptor and non-receptor mediated mechanisms of action) seems the most appropriate way at present of assessing the potential endocrine disrupting activities of chemicals. At Unilever we have used a combination of in vitro assays (receptor binding, reporter gene and cell proliferation assays) together with short-term in vivo tests (uterotrophic assay in immature rodents) to examine the oestrogenic potential of a large number of chemicals. An evaluation of the advantages and limitations of these methods is provided. Finally, any potential test system needs to be validated and standardized before the information generated can be for the identification of hazard, and possibly for risk assessment purposes.

AB Primary particulate matter is emitted directly into the atmosphere from various anthropogenic and natural sources such as power plants (combustion of fossil fuels) or forest fires. Secondary particles are formed by transformation of SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOC in the atmosphere. They both contribute to ambient particulate matter concentrations, which may have adverse effects on human health, Health hazards are caused by small particulate size, high number of especially fine (<2.5 <mu>m) and ultra-fine (<0.1 <mu>m) particles and/or their chemical composition. As part of an integrated assessment model developed at IIASA, a module on primary particulate matter (PM) emissions has been added to the existing SO2, NOx, NH3 and VOC sections. The module considers so far primary emissions of total suspended particles (TSP), PM10 and PM2.5 from aggregated stationary and mobile sources. A primary PM emission database has been established. Country specific emission factors for stationary sources have been calculated within the module using the ash content of solid fuels.

TI Simultaneous modelling of operative mortality and long-term survival
   after coronary artery bypass surgery
SO STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID GRAFT-SURGERY; REGRESSION; EVOLUTION; THERAPY; DISEASE
AB Typical analyses of lifetime data treat the time to death or failure as the response variable and use a variety of modelling strategies such as proportional hazards or fully parametric, to investigate the relationship between the response and covariates. In certain circumstances it may be more natural to view the distribution of the response variable as consisting of two or more parts since the survival curve appears segmented. This article addresses such a scenario and we propose a model for simultaneously investigating the effects of covariates over the two segments. The model is an analogue of that proposed by Lambert for zero-inflated Poisson regression. The application is central to the model development and is concerned with survival after coronary artery bypass surgery. Here operative mortality, defined as death within 30 days after surgery, and long-term mortality, are viewed as distinct outcomes. For the application considered, the survivor function displays much steeper descent during the first 30 days after surgery, that is, for operative mortality, than after this period. An investigation of the effects of covariates on operative and long-term mortality after coronary artery bypass surgery illustrates the usefulness of the proposed model.

AB Chromium is found in soil from natural sources and anthropogenic activities. The ingestion of soil contaminated with chromium especially by children can have toxic consequences. Therefore, it is important to quantify the oral bioaccessibility of chromium in contaminated soil, In this study, chromium-51 as chromic(III) chloride and sodium chromate(VI), was mixed with an Atsion sandy soil and a Keyport clay soil and stored for 4 mo at either 21-25 degreesC or 2-4 degreesC. Utilizing simulated gastric conditions, the oral bioaccessibility of chromium in soil was determined. When the effects of soil on the bioaccessibility of chromium were compared, the data revealed that the bioaccessibility of chromium(III) from the clay soil was significantly lower than from the sandy soil at 21-25 degreesC. However, at 2-4 degreesC, more chromium(III) was extracted by synthetic gastric fluid from the clay soil than from the sandy soil. Temperature was also a factor as evidenced by the higher bioaccessibility of chromium(VI) in the sandy soil at 2-4 degreesC and of both chromium species in the clay soil at the same temperature. Reduction of the soluble chromium(VI) chemical to the nonsoluble chromium(III) compound in the acidic soils by naturally occurring organic matter in soil would explain the lower bioaccessibility of chromium(VI) at 21-25 degreesC. At 2-4 degreesC, the data indicate that the rate of chromium(VI) reduction to chromium(III) was slowed. Although the results of this study are limited to one low concentration of chromium(III) and chromium(VI) and indicate that the bioaccessibility of chromium in soil can range between 18% and 72%, the data also suggest that there may be a potential health hazard from oral exposure to chromium in heavily contaminated sites. Therefore, more extensive research should be conducted to determine if these findings can be extended to environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to use emergency department data to estimate levels of morbidity and risk factors due to earthquake-related mechanisms of injury subsequent to an urban night-time earthquake.
   METHODS: Data were abstracted from 4190 medical records for the month of January, 1994. Injuries attributable to the earthquake were identified through emergency department: and medical records. These injuries were: (a) categorized by mechanism of injury; (b) assigned an injury severity score; and (c) linked to structural and geologic data. Proportional polytomous and dichotomous logistic regression were used to estimate risk of more severe injury associated with demographic characteristics, injury characteristics, structural characteristics, and geologic factors.
   RESULTS: More severe earthquake-related injuries (serious versus moderate and moderate versus minor) were statistically significantly associated with patient age (greater than or equal to 60 years old), upper extremities, falling, multi-family structures, pre-1960 housing, and the 50th percentile of Peak Ground Acceleration, after adjusting for all other available demographic, injury, structural, and geologic characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: The current recommendation of 'duck, cover, and hold' might not be optimal during a nighttime earthquake, particularly if individuals are in the padded environment of the bed. Actions such as reaching for or catching objects, bracing, or holding onto perceived stable objects may increase risk for more serious injury. Alternate responses include assuming a tucked position las in airline crashes) or staying in bed for non-ambulating people. Structural damage and structure size were not associated with more serious injuries, but structure use and age were, leading the authors to suspect that unmeasured socioeconomic factors might impact risk factors. The importance of including population demographic characteristics in hazard modeling is emphasized. Atm Epidemiol 2001; 11:347-357. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID URANIUM; GAS
AB Naturally occurring radionuclides (NORs) from the Th-232- and U-238-series, which are omnipresent in the earth's crust, can be concentrated by technical activities, particularly those involving natural resources. Although, a great deal of work has been done in the field of radiation protection and remedial action on uranium and other mines, recent concern has been devoted to the hazard arising from naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) in oil and gas facilities. NORM wastes associated with oil and gas operations from scale deposits, separated sludge and water at different oil fields in the eastern acid western deserts were investigated. Concentrations of the uranium, thorium, and potassium (K-40) series have been determined from high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. Total uranium content of samples was determined using laser fluorimetry. The levels of radioactivity were mainly due to enhanced levels of dissolved radium ions. Only minute quantities of uranium and thorium were present. The disequilibrium factor for U-238/Ra-226 has been determined. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Milk has a natural microbial flora and has a risk of inadvertent contamination during collection and subsequent processing. Components of this flora are human pathogens so through the food chain from milking to man, these pathogens have to be eliminated or controlled. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the safety of their food. The dairy industry has an impressive record of food safety as a small percentage of foodborne illness outbreaks recorded now in developed countries are milk related. Food safety programs have been in place within the dairy industry beginning with its widespread acceptance of heat pasteurisation of raw milk and have been progressively developed in reaction to challenges such as foodborne listeriosis. However, there is no room for complacency as strict control is required continuously in food safety programs and vigilance is required in monitoring challenges from new and emerging microbial hazards and food innovations.

AB Background and aims: Tamoxifen (TMX) has proven to be an effective palliative treatment for advanced breast cancer with low reported incidence of side effects. TMX has been demonstrated to be: an initiator and/or a promoter in the rat model of hepatocarcinogenesis. To document the long-term effect of TMX in mice treated with p-dimerhylaminuazobenzene (DAB), we have investigated the time response action of these drugs on different biochemical parameters. Methods: A group of animals was placed on dietary DAB (0.5%, w/w) during a period of 28 weeks. Control animals received a standard laboratory diet. Two other groups of non-treated and DAB-treated animals received TMX citrate (0.025%. w/w) in the diet since day 20. Results: The activities of the enzymes involved in heme synthesis and degradation as evaluated in the DAB group was not further affected by TMX. DAB and/or TMX treatment significantly increased the content of total cytochrome P450 and also the activity of glutathione S-transferase indicating liver damage. In all treated groups oxidative stress and an adaptive response of the natural defense system (catalase and superoxide dismutase) were demonstrated. Histological and morphological studies revealed liver cell hyperplasia in DAB treated group: however. only in the DAB + TMX group solid. trabecular and acinar hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed at the end of the experimental trial. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that TMX produced changes in hepatic enzyme activities which may be relevant fur the metabolism and disposition of this and/or other drugs. Because liver tumors could be initiated and promoted by several agents which need to be activated. the possible hazard of TMX should be considered. This study reports that long-term treatment with TMX enhances hepatocarcinogenesis induced by DAB. The widespread use of TMX as an anticancer agent adds to the significance of this study.

AB Optical systems have been an integral part of space technology since Lunik 3 returned the first pictures from the far side of the moon in 1959. Meteoroids present an obvious hazard, and these natural projectiles have been joined by increasing numbers of man-made debris as space exploitation expands. Although the probability of catastrophic impact caused by the micrometeoroid and orbital debris environment is still extremely small for any given lens or mirror, degradation caused by roughening of the optical surfaces by microimpacts is almost certain, especially in lower orbits. A straightforward algorithm is presented for analyzing this degradation, along with an example analysis for a spacecraft in a Molniya orbit.

AB Tall, slender structures and long bridges inherit numerous uncertainties due to model errors, stress calculations, material properties, and load environments and may undergo large forces from natural hazards such as earthquakes and strong wind events. This paper develops a robust active control approach with parametric uncertainty in the system and control input and unstructured uncertainty in the disturbance input matrices based on an uncertain structural system. A special single-valued decomposition (SVD) is applied to structured uncertain structures. The robust control law provides robust relative stability, an H-infinity-norm disturbance attenuation, and H-2 optimality. The H-infinity norm of the transfer function from the external disturbance forces (e.g., earthquake, wind, etc.) to the observed system states is restricted by a prescribed attenuation index delta. Preservation of robust H-2 optimality of uncertain structural systems is discussed. This paper considers both structured uncertainties and norm-bounded unstructured uncertainties. Numerical simulations that use the robust controller show significant reduction in vibrations.

AB Mate-competition theory predicts that males will invest resources toward intrasexual competition for mates until reproductive benefits are outweighed by costs to future fitness. In populations that have a substantial proportion of mature males, theory predicts that young males will forego reproduction to reduce exposure to mortality that may result from breeding efforts. We examined age-specific mortality of makes in a white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) population in which > 50% of the males were greater than or equal to3.5 years old to determine whether patterns of male mortality conform to mate-competition theory. Annual mortality rates were relatively stable throughout adulthood (0.26-0.38), but causes of mortality changed with age. Young males (1.5 and 2.5 years old) were most susceptible to human-induced mortality (e.g., hunting and vehicle accidents), whereas males greater than or equal to3.5 years old tended to die from non-human causes (e.g., fighting, predation) more frequently than did younger deer. Proportional hazard models also indicated that as antler size increased, likelihood of mortality increased. Age-and cause-specific patterns of mortality in adult male deer from a population with > 50% mature males reflected patterns predicted by mate-competition theory. When managing deer populations with high proportions of mature males, it is important to account for shifts in susceptibility to human-induced and natural mortality agents.

AB Background. The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship of albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with natural death and renal failure in an Australian Aboriginal community with high rates of renal disease.
   Methods. Study subjects were 825 adults (18+ years, mean 33.6 years) or 88% of adults in a remote community who participated in a health screening program offered between 1990 and 1997. The urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR; g/mol) was used as the renal disease marker. Participants were followed for 1.0 to 9.8 years (mean 5.8 years) until renal failure. death, the start of systematic antihypertensive/renal-prorective treatment or June 30, 2000.
   Results. Sixty-five people reached a terminal end point of renal failure or natural death. Sixteen people developed terminal renal failure, all of whom had an ACR of 34+ at baseline exam. There were 39 other natural deaths, which were also strongly correlated with increasing ACR and decreasing GFR over a wide range. This was observed in people without diabetes and in people with normal and elevated blood pressures. it applied to deaths associated with cardiovascular disease and to deaths without an assigned primary or underlying cardiovascular or renal cause. With adjustment for age, the association with death was more robust with ACR than GFR. When compared with people with an ACR <3.4, the hazard ratio (HR; 95% CI) for nonrenal natural death of persons with an ACR 3.4 to 33 was 3.0 (1.1 to 8.4). with an ACR 34 to 99, it was 5.4 (1.13 to 15.9). and with an ACR 100+, it was 6.5 (2.0 to 21). Regression equations predicted that each tenfold increase in the ACR was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in all-cause natural death: a > 400-fold increase in renal deaths, a 4-fold increase in cardiovascular deaths, and a 2.2-fold increase in nonrenal noncardiovascular deaths. Eighty-four percent of all-cause natural death was associated with pathologic albuminuria.
   Conclusion. All renal failure develops out of a background of persistent albuminuria in this population. More important, albuminuria and, inversely, GFR are powerful markers of risk for nonrenal natural death, including, but not restricted to, cardiovascular deaths. Most of the risk for premature death can be assessed by a simple urine test, and interventions that prevent development and progression of albuminuria and loss of GFR should not only prevent renal insufficiency, but powerfully reduce mortality from natural causes as well.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemorrhages from cerebral cavernous malformations (CMs) sometimes seem to occur in closely spaced "clusters" interspersed with long hemorrhage-free intervals. Clustering of hemorrhages could affect retrospective assessments of radiosurgery efficacy in prevention of CM rehemorrhage. However, this empirical observation had not been tested quantitatively. To test whether CM hemorrhages tend to cluster, we reviewed pretreatment rebleeding rates after a first symptomatic hemorrhage in CM patients who later underwent surgery or radiosurgery.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 141 patients with CMs who presented with clinically overt hemorrhage, and who subsequently underwent surgery or proton beam radiosurgery during an 18-year period. Statistical models were used to analyze all events per person and identify potential variation in rebleeding risk with time after a previous hemorrhage.
   RESULTS: Sixty-three of 141 patients experienced a second hemorrhage before treatment; 16 had additional hemorrhages. Five hundred thirty-eight patient years elapsed between first hemorrhages and treatment. The cumulative incidence of a second hemorrhage after the first CM hemorrhage was 14% after 1 year and 56% after 5 years. During the first 2.5 years after a hemorrhage, the monthly rehemorrhage hazard was 2%. The risk then decreased spontaneously to less than 1% per month, which represents a 2.4-fold decline (P < 0.001). Rehemorrhage rates were higher in younger patients (P < 0.01), but not in females or in patients with deep lesions. Shorter intervals between successive hemorrhages did not predict higher subsequent rehemorrhage risk.
   CONCLUSION: The rehemorrhage rate from untreated CMs is high initially, and it decreases 2 to 3 years after a previous hemorrhage. This hazard pattern generates the observed temporal clustering of hemorrhages from untreated CMs.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between age at natural menopause and risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer.
   Methods: Using data from six population-based, case-control studies conducted in the United States, age at natural menopause among 1411 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 6380 control subjects were analyzed using survival analysis methods, including Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards models. Subjects ranged from 20 to 81 years of age.
   Results: The median age at natural menopause was 50 years among cases compared with 51 years among controls, a difference of borderline statistical significance (P = .06), The hazard ratio for the relationship between case-control status and age at natural menopause was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.99, 1.20). Controlling for potential confounders including parity, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, smoking, and body mass index did not appreciably change this association. There was little evidence of an association between early age at natural menopause and early onset ovarian cancer (diagnosis age under 48 years).
   Conclusion: We observed a weak association between ovarian cancer risk and age at natural menopause and, among women with early onset disease, there was little evidence to suggest that early menopause is related to ovarian cancer, Thus, there seems little need for increased surveillance or screening for ovarian cancer among women with early natural menopause.

AB The demand for improved information on regional and global fire activity in the context of land use/land cover change, ecosystem disturbance, climate modeling, and natural hazards has increased efforts in recent years to improve earth-observing satellite sensors and associated methods for fire information retrieval. While sensor development has made considerable headway for fire monitoring with the recent launch of Terra in late 1999 and upcoming missions such as bispectral infrared detection (BIRD), FOCUS, and the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), the retrieval of fire properties from satellite observations remains problematic. Current methods for determining properties of actively burning fires, for example, continue to be based on a simple two-component model developed by Dozier in 1981 [Remote Sens. Environ. 11 (1981) 221.]. Its limitations in terms of reliable operational fire property retrieval have been known for some time, although not examined in derail to date. With new measurements from recently deployed and evolving satellite systems. which offer kev advantages for fire remote sensing, it is appropriate now to more comprehensively examine the heritage methodology for fire property retrieval. The results of a sensitivity analysis indicate that under realistic conditions the random errors in fire temperature and area retrieved using Dozier's method are +/- 100 K and +/- 50% at one standard deviation, respectively, for fires occupying a pixel fraction greater than 0.005 (this corresponds to a 5000-m(2) fire within a 1-km pixel). For smaller active fires, larger random and systematic errors are likely to occur. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science inc. All rights reserved.

   intraepithelial lesion development in young females

AB Context Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) have been described as a benign cytological consequence of active human papillomavirus (HPV) replication. Several studies have reported that certain behavioral and biological risks exist for LSIL, suggesting that HPV alone is not sufficient for the development of LSIL. However, because most of these studies have been cross-sectional, it is not known whether behavioral and biological risks are simply risks for HPV infection itself.
   Objective To prospectively examine risks of incident HPV infection in HPV-negative females and of incident LSIL development in females with HPV infection.
   Design Prospective cohort study conducted between 1990-2000, with a median follow-up of 50 months.
   Setting and Participants Females aged 13 to 21 years who attended 2 family planning clinics in the San francisco bay area; 496 had prevalent HPV infection and 105 were HPV-negative.
   Main Outcome Measure Incident development of HPV infection and LSIL, analyzed by various demographic, behavioral, and clinical risk factors.
   Results Fifty-four incident HPV infections occurred in the 105 females who were HPV-negative at study entry (median duration of follow-up for those who remained HPV-negative was 26 months). Multivariable analysis showed that risks of HPV included sexual behavior (relative hazard [RH], 10.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.24-31.50 per new partner per month), history of herpes simplex virus (RH, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.37-9.10), and history of vulvar warts (RH, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.27-5.87). Current use of oral contraceptives had a significantly protective effect (RH, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.86). Among the 496 individuals who were HPV-positive at baseline or in follow-up, there were 109 incident cases of LSIL during the follow-up interval, with a median follow-up time of 60 months for those who never developed LSIL. Human papillomavirus infection was the most significant risk factor for development of LSIL, The multivariable model showed the following risks for LSIL: HPV infection for less than 1 year(RH, 7.40; 95% CI, 4.74-11.57); HPV infection for 1 to 2 years (RH, 10.27; 95% CI, 5.64-18.69); HPV infection for 2 to 3 years (RH, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.86-20.06); and daily cigarette smoking (RH, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.12-2.48).
   Conclusion Our results indicate distinct risks for HPV and LSIL. In addition, most women with HPV infection in our study did not develop LSIL within a median follow-up period of 60 months. These findings underscore the hypothesis that certain biological risks thought to be associated with LSIL are, in fact, risks for acquisition of HPV. Cigarette smoking was a risk specific to LSIL, supporting the role of tobacco in neoplastic development.

AB Background: The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of most AIDS-related opportunistic illnesses (Ol) and death in HIV-infected individuals. We investigated whether there are demographic disparities in HIV disease progression in the HAART era compared with before.
   Methods: HIV-infected patients in an urban HIV clinical practice in the USA were compared using survival methods for time to a new AIDS-defining Ol or death in therapeutic era 1 (monotherapy and combination therapy; 1990-1995; n = 2016) versus era 2 (HAART; 1996-1999; n = 2165).
   Results: A total of 1037 (51.4%) events occurred in era 1; 666 (30.8%) events occurred in era 2. in women, the median disease-free survival time increased by 14% (CD4 cell counts > 200 cells/mm(3) at baseline) and 34% (CD4 cell counts less than or equal to 200) in era 2 compared with era 1,whereas for men it increased by 43 and 100%. The relative hazard (RH) of progression for women compared with men in era 2 compared with era 1 was 1.34. For injecting drug use (IDU), disease-free survival time increased by 16% and 34% in era 2 compared with era 1, whereas non-IDU improved by 65 and 135%. The RH of progression for IDU compared with non-IDU in era 2 compared with era 1 was 1.39. No significant differences were detected by race or other HIV transmission risk group.
   Conclusion: Disease-free survival time was extended with the use of HAART, but these gains were not equally distributed by sex and IDU in our cohort. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

DE water contamination; environmental risk; heavy metals; copper mining
AB The Camaqua Copper Mines (CCM) were the main sulphide deposit in Southern Brazil and have been in operation from last century to 1996. To evaluate water contamination and environmental risk increase by heavy metals from mining operations, two points on the Joao Dias Creek were sampled Station 1, background area and Station 2, contaminated anal. Mining activity increased the natural weakly heavy metal fluxes by approximately 5424 kg. (similar to 60%) of the total metal flux, 1542 kg. (similar to 49%) of dissolved and 3881 kg (similar to 66%) of particulate metal flux. Total metal flux of anthropic origin was mostly due to Fe followed by Cu > Zn > Mn whereas Cd, As and Pb fluxes were negligible. The potential human health hazards and risk assessment related to daily intake of water from Joao Dias Creek are mostly due to Mn and should be of concern for the contaminated area. The ingestion of water from station 2 represents incremental risks of 130% and 59% respectively, considering the non-carcinogenic and the carcinogenic effects. The real increase of human health hazards may be greater than those related to the total concentrations since Mn and As dissolved concentrations were 5.5 and 2.0 higher than acceptable, respectively.

AB Congenital patients who lack natural killer (NK) cell activity experience repeated polymicrobial infections. NK cell activity varies significantly among normal people, but it is unknown whether this variation influences their ability to fight infections. This study examined this concern. NK cell activity and other variables, i.e. age, sex, performance status (PS), serum albumin value, lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, various lymphocyte subsets, etc. were determined for 108 immunologically normal elderly subjects who were in nursing homes due to an impaired PS. We analysed for correlations between these variables and the follow-up results of the subjects. Forty-eight subjects developed infection(s) during the first year of follow-up. A low NK cell activity was associated with the development of infection (P = 0.0105, multivariate logistic regression analysis). The relative risk for the development of infection increased in accordance with the decrease in the NK cell activity. Eleven subjects died of infection during the study period. A low NK cell activity was associated with short survival due to infection (P = 0.0056, multivariate Cox's proportional-hazards regression analysis). Our data indicate that low NK cell activity is associated with development of infections and death due to infection in immunologically normal elderly subjects with an impaired PS.

AB In 123 patients, 339 implants were connected to 313 teeth by means of fixed partial prostheses (test) and followed up for 1.5-15 years (mean: 6.5). In another ad random selected 123 patients, 329 implants were connected to each other by means of 123 freestanding fixed partial prostheses (control) and were followed up for 1.3-14.5 years (mean: 6.2). The aim of this study was to compare both treatment modalities with each other based on implant, tooth and prosthesis complications. The cumulative implant success, based on implant immobility and/or lack of implant fractures after loading, in the test and control groups amounted to 95% and 98.5%, respectively. Although in the test group 10 implants versus only 1 in the control group failed, a regression analysis of the survival data, based on the cox proportional hazards model, revealed no significant difference. In the test group periapical lesions (3.5%), tooth fracture (0.6%) and tooth extraction due to fatal decay or periodontitis (1 %) were observed, besides tooth intrusion (3.4%) and crown cement failure (8%). Framework fracture occurred in 3 patients. In the control group, only 2 abutment screws fractured. The treatment of partial edentulism by means of oral implants was beneficial for our patients. Because of a clear tendency of more implant failures (mobility or fractures) and tooth complications in the tooth-implant connected prostheses, the freestanding solution is the primary option to be considered. To avoid intrusion of abutment teeth, the connection, if made, should be completely rigid.

AB The considerable morphodynamic energy provided by the continuing tectonic evolution of Asia is expressed in high erosional potentials and very high rates of sediment production that make this continent unequalled as a terrestrial source of primary silt. Many of these environments are hazardous, threatening human occupation., health and livelihood, especially in regions of dense population such as the loess lands of north China. Dry loess can sustain nearly vertical slopes, being perennially under-saturated. However, when locally saturated, it disaggregates instantaneously. Such hydrocompaction is a key process in many slope failures, made worse by an underlying mountainous terrain of low-porosity rocks. Gully erosion of loess may yield very high sediment concentrations ( > 60% by weight). Characteristic vertical jointing in loess influences the hydrology. Enlarged joints develop into natural sub-surface piping systems, which on collapse, produce a "loess karst" terrain. Collapsible loess up to 20 m thick is common on the western Loess Plateau. Foundation collapse and cracked walls are common, many rapid events following periods of unusually heavy monsoonal rain. Slope failure is a major engineering problem in thick loess terrain, flow-slide and spread types being common. The results are often devastating in both urban and rural areas. An associated hazard is the damming of streams by landslides. The human population increases the landslide risk in China, notably through imprudent land-use practices including careless water management. A number of environmentally related endemic diseases arise from the geochemistry of loess and its groundwaters. including fluorosis, cretinism, Kaschin-Beck Disease, Keshan Disease and goitre. The Chinese desert margins also have a major atmospheric dust problem. The effect of such dust upon human health in these extensive regions, including many large cities, has yet to be evaluated, but pneumoconiosis is thought to affect several million people in north and west China.

AB Humans are losing touch with the Earth. They tend to ignore the strong linkages between earth resources and the level of civilization they enjoy. They also tend to ignore the forces of earth processes, rendering themselves insensitive to natural processes and hazards. The disconnection is strongest in the developed, first world of which Canada is a part. Earth scientists hold the key knowledge to repair this disconnection between the Earth and its people. It is critical that we place more of a social context on earth science, especially as it is communicated to the public. We need to re-establish the connections between our well-being and the earth resources that make it possible. We also need to educate society about how Earth processes affect our everyday life. By the same token, we also need to elaborate more of the social context of earth sciences to students of earth sciences.

TI Not necessarily in the same boat: Heterogeneous risk assessment among
   east African pastoralists
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID STRATEGIES; TURKANA; KENYA
AB This article studies variation in risk assessment by pastoralists in the and and semi-arid lands of southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Despite superficial homogeneity among east African pastoralists, we show that there exists considerable within-group heterogeneity in their assessment of various risks. We conceptualise risk as comprising four distinct components: objective exposure, subjective perception, ex ante mitigation capacity, and ex post coping capacity. This conceptualisation provides an effective framework for understanding the observed heterogeneity as the natural consequence of (sometimes modest) structural differences in economic activity patterns, agroclimatic conditions, proximity to towns, wealth, and gender roles. It there re provides a useful tool for drawing out the policy implications of subjects' expressed concerns about prospective livelihood hazards.

AB Purpose. The red color sign observed by endoscopic examination is a reliable predictive factor for variceal bleeding. The aim of this study was to calculate the incidence of the appearance of the red color sign and to evaluate its predictive factors. Methods. Endoscopic examination was repeatedly performed in 359 consecutive patients diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis with or without esophageal varices, during a median follow-up period of 2651 days. Results. The incidence of the appearance of the red color sign on esophageal varices at the end of the tenth year was compared among patients without varices (11.4%), those with small varices (45.4%), and those with mid-size varices (65.0%). The difference was significant (P < 0.0001). The number of varices (P = 0.0010), size of varices (P = 0.0064), platelet count (P = 0.0168), and alpha-fetoprotein level (P = 0.0207) were significantly correlated with the appearance of the red color sign, as estimated by the multivariate Cox hazard model. To exclude the influence of carcinogenesis, observation was stopped when hepatocellular carcinoma was discovered. Additive predictive factors with significance were: number of varices (P = 0.001), size of varices (P = 0.027), and platelet count (P = 0.0315). Conclusions. Endoscopic signs of esophageal varices and platelet count were significant predictors for the appearance of the red color sign.

AB Although doctors are increasingly evaluated on the basis of return-to-work (RTW) outcomes, the effect of doctor-patient communication about the workplace and RTW after an occupational injury has received little research attention, The effect of patient-reported doctor communication on duration of disability was examined retrospectively in a 3-year cohort of 325 claimants with a lost-time low back injury. Although doctor proactive communication was associated with a greater likelihood of RTW during the acute phase (< 30 days of disability), this effect disappeared when injury and workload characteristics were taken into account. A positive RTW recommendation was associated with about a 60% higher RTW rate during the subacute/chronic phase (> 30 days of disability) only. Prospective studies are needed to confirm this effect. The impact of physician communication on RTW is largely confounded by injury and workplace factors.

AB We evaluate the time-course of deaths and evidence of periods of increased mortality (i.e., critical periods) in laboratory populations of larval flatfish. First, we make the distinction between age-at-death and abundance-at-time data for fish larvae, the latter being typical in studies of natural populations. Next, we describe an experimental investigation of age-and temperature-dependent mortality in larval winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus. The survivorship curves of these populations differed significantly in both the magnitude and time-course of mortality among the four water temperatures evaluated (7, 10, 13, and 16 degreesC). Mortality was highest in the cooler temperatures and concentrated in the third quarter of larval life, largely concurrent with settlement of surviving members of the cohort. Among the statistical methods for analysing survival data, the proportional-hazards model with time-varying covariates proved best at capturing the patterns of age-specific mortalities. We conclude that fair appraisals of recruitment hypotheses which are predicated on periods of high, age-specific mortality that vary with environmental conditions (e.g., Hjort's critical period hypothesis) will require: (1) data that are based on age, not time; (2) data that are of higher temporal resolution than commonly available at present and (3) analytical methods that are sensitive to irregularities in survivorship curves. We suggest four research approaches for evaluating critical periods in nature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vermont is one of approximately half a dozen states for which no official drought mitigation plan exists. Given the recurring nature of this natural hazard, current contingency measures should be expanded upon into a coherent mitigation framework. The types of drought and impacts resulting from the 1998 to 1999 event were the focus of a previous article in this volume. The present article builds on the understanding of drought characteristics specific to the Vermont context and introduces the rationale behind a proposed drought planning framework. Pivotal organizations and institutions that should be involved in this process are also presented.

AB The volcanic rocks of Rome provide chronostratigraphic constraint that is of use to geologists, archaeologists, and paleontologists. Identifying the areal distribution of these rocks, their mode of emplacement and a detailed chronology of the eruptive events also, is crucial for assessing local natural hazards in a volcanic-tectonic context, and for recognizing whether the volcanoes may erupt again in the future. We have identified and dated many of the volumetrically significant eruptive units from the Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills (Colli Albani) and propose a formalized volcanic stratigraphy for Rome. It is probable that seismic events triggered some eruptions, as several ignimbrites: from the two volcanoes have statistically indistinguishable ages. Following a 200 + kyr period of dormancy that was coincident with a pulse of regional uplift, the Alban Hills appears to have begun recently (circa 45 ka), a new eruptive cycle, Therefore, accurate assessment of volcanic-tectonic hazards, and estimation of possible future volcanic activity, is necessary for the safety of the five million people living near these volcanoes.

AB The paper explores methodological and mathematical aspects of a new approach to constructing optimal schedules of cancer screening. This approach consists of systematic use of tumor size at detection, combining stochastic models of tumor latency, tumor growth and turner detection, and employing a new biologically natural screening efficiency criterion defined as the Kantorovich distance between the tumor size at spontaneous detection in the absence of screening and the tumor size at detection when both spontaneous and screening based mechanisms are in place. An explicit formula. for the efficiency functional is obtained. Sample calculations suggest that in the case of exponential tumor growth, the optimal screening schedules with a fixed number of exams have a trend to uniformity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB An unprecedented number of women will experience menopause in the next decade. Although the timing of menopause affects long-term disease risk, little is known about factors that affect this timing. In the present 1995-1997 cross-sectional study, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, the relation of demographic and lifestyle factors to age at natural menopause was examined in seven US centers and five racial/ethnic groups. All characteristics were self-reported by women aged 40-55 years (n = 14,620). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the probability of menopause by age. Overall, median age at natural menopause was 51.4 years, after adjustment for smoking, education, marital status, history of heart disease, parity, race/ethnicity, employment, and prior use of oral contraceptives. Current smoking, lower educational attainment, being separated/widowed/divorced, nonemployment, and history of heart disease were all independently associated with earlier natural menopause, while parity, prior use of oral contraceptives, and Japanese race/ethnicity were associated with later age at natural menopause. This sample is one of the largest and most diverse ever studied, and comprehensive statistical methods were used to assess factors associated with age at natural menopause, Thus, this study provides important insights into this determinant of long-term disease risk in women.

AB Many mountain forests in the European Alps protect people and assets against natural hazards such as snow avalanches. These forests are mainly managed to ensure continuous and effective protection. Silvicultural operations should make protection forests as resistant as possible to natural disturbing agents such as wind that have the potential to impair effective protection, and they should increase their elasticity, i.e. speed of recovery once disturbances have impaired the protective effect. However, current management approaches do not yet consistently focus on enhancing resistance and elasticity in the face of multiple disturbances. Moreover, they use a stand level approach instead of an ecosystem-based approach. These shortcomings can be overcome by explicitly integrating resistance and elasticity into forest management. In this paper, the meaning of resistance and elasticity is clarified and illustrated with examples. A procedure to integrate resistance and elasticity into forest management is presented, with the five steps: Identification of disturbances and slow undesirable changes, identification of characteristics relevant to the resistance and elasticity of a forest to disturbances, identification of variables for monitoring these characteristics, establishment of target values for each variable, and implementation including monitoring. Suggestions to quantify resistance and elasticity are made. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the Swiss mountains there are numerous Norway spruce stands which have never or have not received silvicultural treatment for a long time. It is feared that the stand structures and, therefore, stand stability, i.e. resistance against storms and snow loads, will decline to such a degree that their protective function against natural hazards will be reduced.
   In this study, such stands, which local forest services consider having unsatisfactory structures and being unstable and with little regeneration, were subjected to a first thinning operation. Selected silvicultural treatments to maintain and improve the mechanical stability of the stands with the long-term goal of transforming them into mountain selection forests are presented. The subsequent development of the stands will be monitored and analysed. The effects of the treatments on structure and stand stability will be examined in the long-term by comparisons to adjacent stands with similar structures and similar stability which have received no treatment. First results concerning the effectiveness of the applied silvicultural measures regarding stand structure are analysed. It seems that the variables hid ratio, spatial distribution and the stand density index (SDI) are the best indicators of the effectiveness of the silvicultural treatment.

AB Landward vergence in accretionary wedges is an uncommon phenomenon not readily explained by classical Mohr-Coulomb critical wedge theory. Predominantly landward-vergent thrust faults are observed along the Cascadia convergent margin from 45 degreesN to 48 degreesN. We present depth-migrated multichannel seismic images of the internal structure of the accretionary wedge offshore Washington collected during the ORWELL project in 1996, These reveal a high p-wave velocity (greater than or equal to4 km/s) basal layer that thickens landward and serves as a decollement for a series of overlying landward-vergent thrust faults. Analog modeling using a ductile basal layer consisting of silicone putty produces an array of trenchward-propagating, landward-vergent thrusts and offers a plausible mechanical model for the evolution of these structures. The theological properties of a basal calcareous mudstone layer offshore Cascadia are discussed in relation to the mechanics of landward vergence and to rapid loading due to the prograding Nitinat and Astoria deep-sea fans. A viscoelastic layer beneath the accretionary wedge is considered to be capable of rupturing during great interplate earthquakes and thus represents an increased risk for both the maximum size of such an event and for the generation of tsunamis.

AB The Ring of Fire guards the margins of the continents and island arcs bordering the Pacific Ocean. Active volcanic belts dominate the terrestrial landscape. and about 100 km off-shore, oceanic trenches parallel the volcanoes. This topographically rugged, geologically unstable transition separating subaerial and submerged portions of the solid Earth is a reflection of convergent and transform lithospherie plate boundaries. The plates themselves are carried along by thermally driven mantle convection. Slow but inexorable differential motions along the plate junctions are responsible for the globe's most intense seismic activity as well as deadly eruptions. Tsunamis, avalanches, mudflows. and catastrophic land subsidence are common associates in this dynamic geologic realm. Moreover. the world's greatest ocean-a heat-transfer engine driven convectively by incoming solar radiation-spawns the most powerful tropical storms, producing devastating coastal flooding. Nowhere is the Pacific Rim free of these natural hazards. As the burgeoning populations of the Circumpacific nations occupy and more intensively develop and degrade ever-larger tracts along the Rim, the aggregate vulnerability of society to natural hazards will increase. To the extent that these same Circumpacific nations increasingly influence global economic systems, the cascade of suffering produced by episodic natural disasters and the rapid transmission of communicable diseases inevitably will produce more substantial financial as well as human and material losses. We can mitigate but not eliminate the adverse effects of natural hazards through a more complete understanding of their fundamental scientific causes, and by planning accordingly. But natural disaster reduction must be coordinated across and transcend political boundaries if we are to be more effective in the future.

AB In the past efforts to prevent catastrophic losses from natural hazards have largely been undertaken by individual property owners based on site-specific evaluations of risks to particular buildings. Public efforts to assess community vulnerability and encourage mitigation have focused on either aggregating site-specific estimates or adopting standards based upon broad assumptions about regional risks. This paper develops an alternative, intermediate-scale approach to regional risk assessment and the evaluation of community mitigation policies. Properties are grouped into types with similar land uses and levels of hazard, and hypothetical community mitigation strategies for protecting these. properties are modeled like investment portfolios. The portfolios consist of investments in mitigation against the risk to a community posed by a specific natural hazard and are defined by a community's mitigation budget and the proportion of the budget invested in locations, of each type.
   The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated through an integrated assessment of earthquake-induced lateral-spread ground failure risk in the Watsonville, California area. Data from the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 are used to model lateral-spread ground failure susceptibility. Earth science and economic data are combined and analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The portfolio model is then used to evaluate the benefits of mitigating the risk in different locations. Two mitigation policies one that prioritizes mitigation by land use type and the other by hazard zone, are. compared with a status quo policy of doing no further mitigation beyond that which already exists. The portfolio representing the hazard zone role yields a higher expected return than the land use portfolio does; however. the hazard zone portfolio experiences a higher standard deviation. Therefore, neither portfolio is clearly preferred. The two mitigation policies both reduce expected losses and increase overall expected community wealth compared to the status quo policy.

AB This paper examines the market for catastrophe event risk - i.e., financial claims that are linked to losses associated with natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Risk management theory suggests protection by insurers and other corporations against the largest cat events is most valuable. However, most insurers purchase relatively little cat reinsurance against large events, and premiums are high relative to expected losses. To understand why the theory fails, we examine transactions that look to capital markets, rather than traditional reinsurance markets, for risk-bearing capacity. We develop eight theoretical explanations and find the most compelling to be supply restrictions associated with capital market imperfections and market power exerted by traditional reinsurers.

AB Object. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the phagocytic, humoral, and cellular arms of the immune system in comatose patients shortly after severe brain injury and to compare the findings with those reported earlier in patients in a persistent vegetative stare. The study was conducted in intensive care units and immunology laboratories of university-affiliated hospitals in central Israel.
   Methods. The study group consisted of 14 men aged 16 to 65 years who were comatose as a result of acute brain injury due to mechanical trauma. All were studied within 72 hours of injury. Brain damage was severe in all cases (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 8). Healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as simultaneous controls.
   Infections arose in nine (75%) of the 12 patients in whom data were available; the cumulative mortality rate was 38% (five of 13 patients in whom outcome data were available). Every patient exhibited one or more defects in at least one arm of the immune system. Significant deficiencies were noted in neutrophil superoxide release, immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG,, IgM, C1q, C2. properdin, alternate C pathway, T cells, T helper cells, T suppressor cells, and natural killer cells. In an earlier series of patients examined by the authors months after the primary insult. these impairments were absent in most of the patients in the vegetative state.
   Conclusions. Significant deficiencies of the immune system, particularly the cellular arm, are precipitated by severe brain injury within 72 hours of the event. These impairments probably play a role in the high rate of complicating infections and multiple organ failure. Together with earlier findings, the results of this study indicate that if brain-injured patients survive these hazards, their immune system will eventually recover.

AB At present, there is much interest in the potential effects of chemicals on the endocrine systems in animals and man. Chemicals with endocrine-disrupting potential include (a) Various phthalates, (b) compounds based on bisphenol A and F, (c) compounds based on alkyl phenols, and (d) the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole. However, the potency of these chemicals in comparison with natural hormones appears to be very low. Although there is some evidence for activity in animals, high doses are usually necessary, and there is controversy and uncertainty in the interpretation of some positive findings. In addition to consideration of potential hazards, the level of exposure through leaching of these chemicals into drinking water is an important component of risk assessment. The present approval processes ensure that such exposure is very low. The paper suggests a strategy for the future continued assurance of an adequate safety margin for human exposure to such substances through drinking water.

AB The aim of this study was to see whether pleiotropic or myeloid hematopoietic growth factors, which do not stimulate normal lymphoid cells, can induce proliferation of blast cells of the acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) of childhood. Bone marrow cells of 13 children with untreated ALL (nine common ALL, two myeloid antigen positive ALL and two early T-cell ALL) formed colonies of leukemic blast cells in primary methylcellulose cultures. Spontaneous growth was observed in three of 13 cases, whereas phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte conditioned medium (PHA-LCM), a conventional source of various natural human cytokines, induced colony formation in ten of 13 cases. A similar rate of responsiveness was seen with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF); a combination of these three cytokines induced colony formation in all cases studied. The effect of these growth factors on colony formation seemed to be dose-dependent in some cases. Of the stimuli studied, GM-CSF induced the smallest number of colonies, whereas the effects of G-CSF, SCF and PHA-LCM were similar in this respect. Combination of cytokines proved to be even more efficient in inducing clonal proliferation of leukemic lymphoblasts. In double combinations, G-CSF and GM-CSF as well as G-CSF and SCF were able to potentiate each other's effects. Triple combination of these cytokines mediated the most potent growth stimulus.
   Our results demonstrate that myeloid and pleiotropic cytokines are able to stimulate clonal proliferation of pediatric leukemic lymphoblasts. This may present a potential hazard to children with ALL while on adjuvant therapy with hematopoietic growth factors. In vitro colony assays performed prior to or in parallel with the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to ALL patients map help to forecast their possible effects on leukemic cells in vivo.

SO PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

ID ECOSYSTEMS
AB Wildfires have long been an important environmental concern in Florida. Recent wildfires along the urban-rural interface of large cities in Florida have pointed to the need for an increased understanding of the physical and biological mechanisms that govern wildfire occurrence. Increased awareness of the relationships between global climate changes occurring in the tropics and their teleconnections outside the tropics dictate a reevaluation of the role of phenomena such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation on the risk of wildfire. One simple way of illustrating the relationship between ENSO and wildfire occurrence is the use of an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on wildfire data that has been categorized according to ENSO status (El Nino, La Nina, and neutral years). This research shows that a statistically significant relationship exists between ENSO conditions and annual wildfire occurrence in Florida when ENSO conditions are treated as a potential precursor to wildfire conditions. In particular, a statistically significant relationship exists between both acreage burned and average fire size, when the data are separated into El Nino and La Nina categories according to the previous year's ENSO status. This supports the idea that the climate from previous years has a measurable effect upon fire statistics in the years following the climate measurements, and that it may be possible to create a regional fire prediction model that incorporates ENSO information.

AB The diversity of the research in earth sciences leads to a multisource approach to investigate the surroundings of Taiwan. Various data sets combined by a Geographical Information System (GIS) enable us to propose an integrated neotectonic map of onshore-offshore Taiwan. Several technical problems arise during the compilation of this map, such as the homogeneity of scales, projections and geodetic systems used, the validity and precision of each data set (line and pixel) and document, and the integration of qualitative and quantitative documents.
   Various types of information are taken into account in this approach, such as topography and bathymetry, geology (lithology, structure), geophysics (gravimetry, magnetism, etc.), geodesy (levelling, GPS, etc.), remote sensing and field works. This multisource approach has been applied to data sets both onland and offshore Taiwan, and has resulted in a preliminary neotectonic map of onshore-offshore Taiwan. This map provides a better comprehension of the geodynamic phenomena that affect Taiwan, and contributes significantly to the relations of the offshore structures and their corresponding reactivated extensional structures onshore (for instance, the Tainan, Taihsi, Okinawa, and Huatung basins).
   This document should benefit both academic research (structural and active fault maps) as well as the applied geological implications (such as natural hazards mapping and evaluation of geotechnic works).

AB Situated at the foot of the Pichincha volcano, the city of Quito is frequently subjected to hydroclimatic hazards. In 1995 an 11.2 km(2) watershed, located in the vicinity of the city, was equipped with eight rain gauges and two Row gauges to better. understand the local rainfall/runoff transformation processes. Rainfall simulation experiments were carried out on more than 40 one-square-metre plots to measure infiltration point-processes. The high density of measurement devices allowed us to identify the origin and nature of the various contributions to runoff for the different physiographic units of the watershed: urban area from an altitude of 2800 to 3200 m; farmland, pasture and forested land, and finally paramo above 3900 m. Runoff occurs mainly in the lower part of the basin and is caused by urbanization; however, the natural soils of this area can also produce Hortonian runoff, which is predominant in a few events. This contribution can be studied through rainfall simulation experiments. In the upper natural zone. the younger and more permeable soils generate less runoff on the slopes. However, almost permanently saturated contributing areas, which are located in the bottom of the quebradas, may generate flood events, the size of which depends on the extent of the area concerned. Variations in the runoff coefficients are related first to the baseflow and second to the amount of rainfall in the previous 24 h. This analysis, which underlines the complexity of a small, peri-ulban, volcanic catchment, is a necessary preliminary to runoff modelling in an area where very few experiments have been carried out on small catchments.

AB Samples of natural and manufactured building materials collected from Algiers have been analysed for Ra-226,Th-232 and K-40 using a high-resolution HPGe gamma -spectrometry system. The specific concentrations for Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, from the selected building materials, ranged from (12-65 Bq kg(-1)). (7-51 Bq kg(-1)) and (36 675 Bq kg(-1)), respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared with the reported data of other countries and with the world average activity of soil. Radium-equivalent activities were calculated for the measured samples to assess the radiation hazards arising from using those materials in the construction of dwellings. All building materials showed Ra,, activities lower than the limit set in the OECD report (370 Bq kg(-1)), equivalent to external gamma -dose of 1.5 mSv yr(-1). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Honey bee co 'lonies typically consist of about 20-40 thousand workers, zero to few thousand males (drones), depending on the time of year, and a single queen, the mother of the colony. Workers typically live 3-6 weeks during the spring and summer and can live about 4 months during the winter. Queens are longer lived. Anecdotes of queens living 2-3 years are not unusual, though they normally live less than a year in commercial hives. Little is known about the life span of drones.
   Queens develop from fertilized eggs that are not different from the eggs that develop into workers. Queens are, however, twice as large, have specialized anatomy, live much longer, and develop faster from egg to adult. All of these differences are derived from differences in larval rearing environment, primarily nutrition. The developmental trajectory of a female larva from worker into a queen can be determined as late as the third day of larval development, after this time the developmental pathway is fixed for a worker phenotype. The total time of larval development is only 5-6 days, therefore, just 2-3 days of differential feeding can lead to profound differences in development, and longevity.
   Workers undergo age development after they become adults. Workers usually initiate foraging behavior when they are 2-3 weeks old. The age at which a worker initiates foraging is a strong determinant of her length of life. This is presumed to be a result of the hazards of foraging, but natural senescence also occurs. Some bees remain in the nest and are never observed to forage, thereby outliving their forager sisters. Corresponding to this behavioral development are changes in the sizes of glands and the production of glandular products, increases in biogenic amine titers within the brain, an increase in the volume of specific regions of the brain, and changes in the neural system that affect perception of stimuli, and learning and memory. These age-related changes in behavior are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Genetic variation has been demonstrated for many of these life history and behavioral traits. Selection and genome mapping studies have demonstrated relationships between the neural system, behavior, and life history traits. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The time-to-ignition of various dominant Mediterranean forest fuels was measured during laboratory tests, in order to develop a relative flammability classification and determine the moisture of extinction of these fuels. The tests were performed with an ignition apparatus manufactured according to the ISO standards (ISO 5657-1986E) and under a wide gradient of fuel moisture contents, ranging from air-dry to fresh foliage. Moisture content was the single most significant factor that affected fuel flammability. Regression models were developed between the time-to-ignition and the moisture content values of all the fuels tested, and subsequently, were used for the relative flammability ranking of these fuels. Fuel moisture of extinction was assessed to have a threshold value ranging from 40% to more than 140% o.d.w. for the species tested. The flammability ranking of natural fuels can be useful in fuel hazard assessment and fire danger rating, thus facilitating the judicial fire management planning in wildlands and at the rural-urban interface.

AB Solutions are developed for the harmonic interior pressurization of idealized hemispherical lava domes to determine the evolution of instability with time. Integrated gas pressure distributions are evaluated to determine uplift on inclined planes of potential detachment that traverse the dome, and to evaluate the limit-equilibrium stability of blocks isolated by these planes. Average pressure distributions show an initial transient rise to peak dynamic gas pressures that corresponds to a harmonic steady state. Progress towards potential instability mirrors this rise, and oscillates with the harmonic steady state. The timing of pressurization of the dome lavas is modulated by a diffusive time. The magnitude of this pressurization is modulated by dome geometry and the magnitude and non-dimensional frequency of the interior inflation. Two distinct pressurization behaviours are apparent: the first, at high relative inflation frequencies, is where the dynamic steady state corresponds to static pressurization at the mean interior pressure; and the second, at low relative inflation frequencies, is where the dynamic state synchronously responds to the oscillating interior-pressure boundary condition, and peak uplift is proportional to the mean pressure plus the maximum harmonic overpressure. These two conditions are separated by a frequency shift, or change in fluid diffusivity, of only two orders of magnitude, and are significant because the destabilizing uplift force may increase by a factor of two, where all other parameters, except excitation frequency or diffusivity, remain fixed. These results are applied to stability evaluations of the lava dome at the Soufriere Hills volcano, to examine failure mechanisms potentially consistent with the observed delay in collapse. Linear models incorporating time-invariant strength and transport parameters are only able to represent collapse for interior gas pressures at the upper limit of observed magnitudes. Conversely, behaviours incorporating fatigue-weakening, or hysteretic permeability enhancement, of the dome rocks are able to approach failure for modest pressurization magnitudes, to match observed delays in collapse and potentially to explain why some domes collapse explosively whereas others do not.

TI Data fusion for investigating land subsidence and coal fire hazards in a
   coal mining area
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID SAR INTERFEROMETRY; JHARIA COALFIELD; INDIA; CALIFORNIA; RADAR
AB Coal mining areas all over the world are often threatened by serious environmental hazards such as the occurrence of coal fires, land subsidence, etc. Coal fires burn away the natural non-renewable coal resources, locally raise the temperature of the area, emit polluting gases such as oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, and when present underground are even the cause of land subsidence. Mining-induced subsidences, on the other hand, cause horizontal and vertical movements in the land surface, and open cracks and fissures that serve as inlets for oxygen, which in turn aggravate the problem of coal fires. These inter-related phenomena often render the mining areas unfit for human inhabitation and the commercial exploitation of coal nearly impossible in some parts.
   In this study, satellite data acquired in three regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, namely optical, thermal and microwave, along with field data, are used to identify the areas affected by coal fires and land subsidence in a coalfield in north-west China. Data fusion techniques are used for an integrated analysis of this complex problem.

AB Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term effect of pumping injection of sodium hyaluronate into the TMJ in patients with non-reducing disc displacement. Patients: Sixty patients with non-reducing disc displacement underwent pumping injection of sodium hyaluronate (pumping group). Seventy-six patients with non-reducing disc displacements were observed without any active treatment (observation group). Study design: In both patient groups clinical signs and symptoms were observed periodically for 2 years. Variables such as age, range of maximum mouth opening, angle of posterior slope of the articular eminence and degenerative bony changes of the condyle at the initial visit were also examined, Cox hazards analysis was applied to examine the clinical outcome for such variables in addition to the results of pumping injection of sodium hyaluronate, Results: Pumping injection of sodium hyaluronate seemed to have a favourable effect when compared with the control group (untreated) (p = 0.0002), However, the four background variables mentioned could not be explained as predictors of outcome. Conclusion: Pumping injection of sodium hyaluronate seems to be effective for non-reducing disc displacement of the temporomandibular joint.

AB A field study was conducted to evaluate the protozoan colonization patterns on artificial substrates in relation to organic pollution within a tropical harbour. The composition of protozoans and their succession rates on artificial substrates( polyurethane foam units) were compared between two field stations(A and B), and their presence were considered with regards to the prevailing water quality wnditions at the study sites. Altogether 44 genera of flagellates and ciliates were documented. The common genera of flagellates encountered included Monas, Polytoma, and Chromalina. Among the ciliates, the predominant genera were Tetrahymena, Vorticella, Lagynophyra, and Heloiphyra. These groups exhibited characteristic successional patterns in relation to ambient water quality. At Station A, located close to the sewage outfall, the water quality parameters included poor Secchi-disc transparency(0.48m), dissolved oxygen of 1.93 mg/ml; salinity of 18 psu, and temperature 31.3 degreesC: Here, the nanoflagellates (spumella) colonized first, followed by microcilliate(Tetrahymena,) and sessile form(Vorticella). Station B, located on the seaward side, was characterized by relatively less-stressed environmental conditions with transparency 1.85m and dissolved oxygen value of 6.04 mg/ml. Salinity of 27.27 psu, and mean temperature of 30 degreesC were recorded at "B". At this,station, the nanoflagellate Polytoma was first documented to colonize on the substrates, followed by microcilliate(Lagynophrya) and suctorid(Heliophyra). These findings support the use of protozoans as indicator species for evaluating the hazards posed by organic pollution to natural estuarine communities.

AB Background and Aims: There is currently no proven chemotherapy regimen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The principal chemotherapeutic approach in most cases is infusion therapy into the hepatic arteries feeding the tumors. However, the clinical effects of chemotherapy are extremely poor. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted a prospective randomized trial of the efficacy of oral administration of enteric-coated tegafur/uracil for advanced HCC.
   Methods: From 1994 to 1999, a total of 56 consecutive patients with unresectable stage IV-A HCC were studied prospectively to examine the efficacy of enteric-coated tegafur/uracil in HCC and to determine the significant prognostic factors. Twenty-eight patients were treated only with enteric-coated tegafur/uracil without other anticancer treatment. Another 20 patients were given conservative management only. The remaining eight patients withdrew from the study.
   Results: In the group treated only with enteric-coated tegafur/uracil, the median survival time and 1 and 2 year survival rates were 12.13 months and 55.3 and 36.9%, respectively. In the control group, the median survival time and 1 year survival rate were 6.20 months and 5.5%, respectively. By both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model, treatment with enteric-coated tegafur/uracil was shown to be the factor most significantly favoring a better prognosis.
   Conclusions: Although the prognosis of most patients with stage IV-A HCC is poor, administration of enteric-coated tegafur/uracil induces long-term survival and is an effective treatment for stage IV-A HCC. (C) 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

TI Distribution and declines in cardiac allograft radionuclide left

AB Background: Cardiac allograft left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an important measure of left ventricular systolic function. Despite widespread use of LVEF after transplantation, its normal range and prognostic value in cardiac allografts has not been defined.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 292 consecutive adult heart transplant patients. Left ventricular ejection fractions were performed at 1, 3, 12, 24, and 48 months after transplantation using radionuclide ventriculography. Endomyocardial biopsies assessed rejection, right heart catheterization assessed loading conditions, and angiography assessed allograft coronary artery disease. We used Cox proportional hazards model to examine the predictive value of LVEF on late mortality.
   Results: Of the patients who survived greater than or equal to4 years, the mean allograft LVEF decreased 4.7 units at 3 months, from 63.8 to 59.7; an additional 4.1 units at 12 months, from 59.7 to 55.6 (p < 0.001); and remained stable afterward. These changes were not associated with concurrent changes in loading conditions, episodes of rejection, or development of allograft coronary artery disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction lower than the 95% normal limit (<40%) at 12 months was inversely associated with risk for late cardiac mortality (relative risk = 3.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-12.2), while controlling for recipient age, sex; donor age, and rejection episodes.
   Conclusions: The cardiac-allograft LVEF frequently decreases in the first year after transplantation. The 95th percentile of allograft LVEF value (<40%) at Year 1 predicts late cardiac mortality among transplant recipients.

AB Due to the growing development of offshore activities alone; margins, in the search for more natural resources. there has been a greater need for under standing the mechanics of slope formation in these areas. One aspect of this relates to the problems associated with slope stability issues. This article presents an perspective view of some geomorphological and geotechnical aspects related to instabilities along ocean margins. In order to properly address the issues of slope stability and other mass movements, we need to improve our technology in the field of sampling, high resolution seismic, and in situ measurements. Ultimately, the goal is to be able to carry out proper risk assessment analysis pertaining to submarine mass movement. This could be achieved by integrating the geotechnical characterisation of mass movements into a risk assessment methodology which can then be applied on a regional basis. With the initiation of a project on continental slope stability (COSTA) during the year 2000, major advances are expected on our understanding of the mechanics of submarine mass movements.

ID FOOD SAFETY; PERCEPTIONS
AB Public risk perceptions and demand for safer food are important factors shaping agricultural production practices in the United States. Despite documented food safety concerns, little attempt has been made to elicit consumers' subjective risk judgments for a range of food safety hazards or to identify factors most predictive of perceived food safety risks. In this study, over 700 conventional and organic fresh produce buyers in the Boston area were surveyed for their perceived food safety risks. Survey results showed that consumers perceived relatively high risks associated with the consumption and production of conventionally grown produce compared with other public health hazards. For example, conventional and organic food buyers estimated the median annual fatality rate due to pesticide residues on conventionally grown food to be about 50 per million and 200 per million, respectively, which is similar in magnitude to the annual mortality risk from motor vehicle accidents in the United States. Over 90% of survey respondents also perceived a reduction in pesticide residue risk associated with substituting organically grown produce for conventionally grown produce, and nearly 50% perceived a risk reduction due to natural toxins and microbial pathogens. Multiple regression analyses indicate that only a few factors are consistently predictive of higher risk perceptions, including feelings of distrust toward regulatory agencies and the safety of the food supply. A variety of factors were found to be significant predictors of specific categories of food hazards, suggesting that consumers may view food safety risks as dissimilar from one another. Based on study findings, it is recommended that future agricultural policies and risk communication efforts utilize a comparative risk approach that targets a range of food safety hazards.

AB Background-The impact of abdominal arterial calcific deposits on the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over a long follow-up interval deserves greater scrutiny.
   Methods and Results-Lateral lumbar radiographs were studied as a predictor of incident coronary heart disease (CHD), CVD, and CVD mortality in 1049 men and 1466 women (mean age, 61 years) who were followed from 1967 to 1989. Anterior and posterior wall calcific deposits in the aorta at the level of the first through fourth lumbar vertebrae were graded according to increasing severity using a previously validated rating scale for abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) that ranges from 0 to 24 points. There were 454 cases of CHD, 709 cases of CVD, and 365 CVD deaths. Proportional hazards logistic regression was used to test for associations between AAC and later events after adjustment for age, cigarette use, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, body mass index, cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. In comparisons with the lowest AAC tertile, the multivariate age-adjusted relative risks (RR) for CVD were increased in tertile 2 (men: RR, 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.74; women: RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.65) and tertile 3 (men: RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.27; women: RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.38). Similar results were obtained with CHD and CVD mortality.
   Conclusions-AAC deposits, detected by lateral lumbar radiograms, are a marker of subdinical atherosclerotic disease and an independent predictor of subsequent vascular morbidity and mortality.

AB Background: It is unclear whether there are differences between men and women with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the plasma level of viral RNA (the viral load). In men, the initial viral load after seroconversion predicts the likelihood of progression to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the relation between the two has not been assessed in women. Currently, the guidelines for initiating antiretroviral therapy are applied uniformly to women and men.
   Methods: From 1988 through 1998, the viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count were measured approximately every six months in 156 male and 46 female injection-drug users who were followed prospectively after HIV-1 seroconversion.
   Results: The median initial viral load was 50,766 copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter in the men but only 15,103 copies per milliliter in the women (P<0.001). The median initial CD4+ count did not differ significantly according to sex (659 and 672 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively). HIV-1 infection progressed to AIDS in 29 men and 15 women, and the risk of progression did not differ significantly according to sex. For each increase of 1 log in the viral load (on a base 10 scale), the hazard ratio for progression to AIDS was 1.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 2.47) among the men and 1.43 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.76 to 2.69) among the women. The median initial viral load was 77,822 HIV-1 RNA copies per milliliter in the men in whom AIDS developed and 40,634 copies per milliliter in the men in whom it did not; the corresponding values in the women were 17,149 and 12,043 copies per milliliter. Given the recommendation that treatment should be initiated when the viral load reaches 20,000 copies per milliliter, 74 percent of the men but only 37 percent of the women in our study would have been eligible for therapy at the first visit after seroconversion (P<0.001).
   Conclusions: Although the initial level of HIV-1 RNA was lower in women than in men, the rates of progression to AIDS were similar. Treatment guidelines that are based on the viral load, rather than the CD4+ lymphocyte count, will lead to differences in eligibility for antiretroviral treatment according to sex.

AB Background: Since 1990, corticosteroids have been recommended as adjunctive therapy for patients with AIDS-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and respiratory failure. We hypothesized that the natural course of AIDS-associated PCP has changed in the era of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy.
   Objective: To study variables obtained on hospital admission for possible prognostic value of short-term (3-month) outcome of PCP. Design and patients: Prospective observational study of 176 consecutive HIV-l-infected individuals with PCP between 1990 and 1999.
   Method: Cox proportional-hazards regression models.
   Results: Univariate analysis showed that age, one or more prior episodes of PCP, use of antimicrobial therapy other than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), use of PCP prophylaxis at diagnosis, and culture of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in BAL predicted progression to death within 3 months. After adjustment, age (relative risk [RR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 9.3), initial antimicrobial therapy other than TMP-SMZ (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 8.5), use of PCP prophylaxis (RR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.2 to 14.4), and culture of CMV in BAL fluid (RR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.9) remained independent predictors of a poor outcome. In contrast, neither Po, nor serum lactate dehydrogenase, which in earlier studies were identified as prognostic markers, were predictors of mortality.
   Conclusion: Age, initial anti-PCP therapy, use of PCP prophylaxis, and BAL CMV status may be useful predictors of outcome of PCP in patients treated in the era of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy.

AB For the last 20 years, human-wildlife conflicts have been rapidly increasing in towns. Although people want "greener" cities, the expansion of disliked species causes problems that are difficult to manage and to reduce. The complexity of the numerous factors involved in these human-wildlife relations needs the development of a comprehensive tool for urban planners. Today, with the development of computers and geographical information systems, it is easier to analyze and combine different spatial data as methods used for the management of risks in studies of natural hazards. Here we present a method for assessing and mapping the risk in cases of human-wildlife conflict. An application to starling management in a town in western France will show the efficiency of our methods to combine information given by a network of experts and to highlight higher risk sites. The map of risk provides a spatial result useful for comprehension, communication between people and agencies, and public education.

AB This study used conditional risk assessments to examine the role of behavioral experiences in risk judgments. Adolescents and young adults (ages 10-30; N = 577) were surveyed on their risk judgments for natural hazards and behavior-linked risks, including their personal experiences with these events. Results indicated that participants who had experienced a natural disaster or engaged in a particular risk behavior estimated their chance of experiencing a negative outcome resulting from that event or behavior as less likely than individuals without such experience. These findings challenge the notion that risk judgments motivate behavior and instead suggest that risk judgments may be reflective of behavioral experiences. The results have implications for health education and risk communication.

AB Until now the widley used predictive long-term hazard models of the most intense natural phenomena do not yield predictions other than the mean return period, which indicates only a mean recurrence time, but does not allow any time prediction of the of occurrence of the phenomena. To achieve more certain estimates an alternative model is proposed, and applied for the prediction of the most violent El-Ninos events. The model is based on the observations which show that (i) the oceanic thermal reservoir generating the El-Ninos events continuously accumulate thermal energy, but releases it both through small and intense El-Ninos events, and that (ii) such an oceanic system evolves saving an almost constant average power. This means that the higher (the less) the number of small events releasing energy after the occurrence of an intense one, the later (the earlier) an intense event is expected to occur. The years of occurrence of all the very strong events estimated by the model are found to be in fair agreement with the observations.

AB In a principal-agent model H with unobservable effort and possible renegotiation. contracts are assumed to satisfy two natural restrictions: limited liability for the agent and monotonicity of payments for the principal, The main result is that if the agent has the renegotiation bargaining power, any contract is weakly Pareto dominated by a debt contract.

AB The presence of toxic metals in natural environments presents a potential health hazard for humans. Metal contaminants in these environments are usually tightly bound to colloidal particles and organic matter. This represents a major constraint to their removal using currently available in situ remediation technologies. One technique that has shown potential for facilitated metal removal from soil is treatment with an anionic microbial surfactant, rhamnolipid. Successful application of rhamnolipid in metal removal requires knowledge of the rhamnolipid-metal complexation reaction. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the biosurfactant complexation affinity fur the most common natural soil and water cations and for various metal contaminants. The conditional stability constant (log K) for each of these metals was determined using an ion-exchange resin technique. Results show the measured stability constants follow the order (from strongest to weakest): Al3+ > Cu2+ > Ph2+ > Cd2+ > Zn2+ > Fe3+ > Hg2+ > Ca2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Mn2+ > Mg2+ > K+. These data indicate that rhamnolipid will preferentially complex metal contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and mercury in the presence of common soil or water cations. The measured rhamnolipid-metal stability constants were found in most cases to be similar or higher than conditional stability constants reported in the literature for metal complexation with acetic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, and fulvic acids. These results help delineate the conditions under which rhamnolipid may be successfully applied as a remediation agent in the removal of metal contaminants from soil, as well as surface waters, ground water, and wastestreams.

AB The Cr-51 release assay has traditionally been used to investigate effector cell cytotoxic function against labeled targets, but this method has inherent problems that include hazards associated with radioactivity, cell labeling and high spontaneous release. Here we describe a novel how cytometric assay which addresses and improves upon the problems currently encountered with the Cr-51 release assay. The fluorometric assessment of T lymphocyte antigen specific lysis (FATAL) assay employs dual staining (PKH-26 and CFSE) to identify and evaluate the target population. We found that the PKH-26/CFSE combination efficiently labeled target cells. Evaluation of the spontaneous leakage from dye labeled target cells was forty fold lower than the spontaneous leakage seen with the Cr-51 release assay. The FATAL assay permitted a more accurate assessment or the effector: target ratio, and detected low levels of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated lysis. There was a strong correlation between the Cr-51 release and FATAL assays, when performed in parallel with identical effector and target cells (r(2) = 0.998, P = <0.0001). This novel method of detecting cytolysis represents a qualitative and quantitative improvement over standard Cr-51 release analysis. The FATAL assay will be of value to further investigate mechanisms of cytolysis by effector cell populations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemokines play an essential role in immune and inflammatory reactions via the recruitment of leukocytes. Studying the role of chemokines in vivo is complicated by the redundancy of their action and by their promiscuous receptor usage. The simultaneous analysis of several chemokines is, therefore, advantageous in order to obtain a comprehensive view of chemokine participation in inflammatory and infectious processes. At present, no multi-probe detection systems are available fur the analysis of recently described chemokines. In this study, new multi-probe RNase protection assay (RPA) template sets were developed for the analysis of murine chemokines. Chemokine cDNA fragments were generated by RT-PCR and individually subcloned into the plasmid pGEM-T providing a T7 promotor. In this way, two multi-probe template sets were constructed each containing six chemokine sequences (CXCL12/SDF-1, XCL1/lymphotactin, CCL20/exodus-1, CCL25/TECK, CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL1/KC, and CCL20/MDC, CXCL9/MIG, CCL9/10/MIP-1 gamma, CXCL13/BLC, CCL12/MCP-5, CCL19/ELC, respectively) and templates for the two house-beeping genes L32 and GAPDH. The evaluation of these RPA template sets in various murine models demonstrated their suitability for the analysis of the above chemokines both under constitutive and infection-induced conditions. To reduce the personal radiation hazard, we found that P-32 could be replaced by P-33 without any loss of assay-sensitivity. These new RPA multi-probe sets provide valuable tools for the simultaneous quantitative determination of gene expression of multiple murine chemokines of both constitutive and inducible type.

TI Risk and impact of natural hazards on a road network
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a study to investigate hazards with the potential to close the Desert Road section of New Zealand's major north-south road link, State Highway 1. The risks caused by snow and ice, volcanic eruptions and lahars, earthquakes, and traffic accidents were evaluated in terms of their expected frequency of occurrence and duration of road closure. The effects of road closures on traffic flow patterns were assessed using a traffic assignment model, with and without allowing for the elasticity of travel demand. A probability distribution for the annual economic impact of road closure was found for each hazard. The viability of various mitigation options for reducing the risk of road closure was assessed, using probability distributions of the benefit-cost ratio for the mitigation options.

DT Article

   public health; Auroral Belt; Circumpolar; heart rate variation
AB Geomagnetic storms are a natural hazard to human health in the Auroral Belt of the Circumpolar. Geomagnetic disturbances in space, and the associated short-term variations in the atmosphere and the geophysical environment, provoke a disturbance of nervous and cardiovascular systems in the human body. The Heart Rate Variability (HRV) method provides a momentary response of human organisms to short-term geophysical perturbations related to the Polar Aurora. A pilot project was performed in the Murmansk region in 1997-1999 with a contemporaneous series of records for both HRV in a test group of local inhabitants and the variations of natural geomagnetic fields. A correlation between geomagnetic disturbances and heart rate was calculated and different reactions of people on geophysical impact were shown. The special group of 'Aurora Disturbance Sensitive People' (ADSP) was revealed. An international study, aimed at evaluation of the impact on human health due to exposure of northern populations to the geophysical risk factor (GRF) in the Circumpolar areas located under the Aurora Belt, is needed.

AB The last few years have seen enormous damage and loss of life from climate and weather phenomena. The most damaging events have included the severe 1997/98 El Nino (with its near-global impacts), Hurricane Mitch, and floods in China in mid-1998. What have we learnt regarding the causes, variability, and predictability, of these phenomena? Can we predict the occurrence of these extreme events, and thereby mitigate their damage? This paper reviews what we have learnt in the last decade or so regarding the predictability of these climate and weather extremes. The view starts with the largest (El Nino) scales, and works towards the scale of individual thunderstorms. It focuses on the practical outcomes of our improved knowledge with regard to decreasing the impact of natural disasters, rather than describing in detail the scientific knowledge underlying these outcomes. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the factors that still restrict our ability to mitigate the deleterious effects of atmospheric and climatic hazards.

AB Within the scope of the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), cause-effect models of large landslides are being developed to estimate hazard. This work is based on a structural exploration of the landslide areas mainly by seismic methods. Information about the status of deformation is obtained by comparison of the actual topography with a reconstruction of the original topography, by GPS, and by SAR interferometry. Geologic and geomorphological evidence, as well as relevant information from other geo-scientific disciplines, is considered. The Finite Element Method is used to model the initial phase of a mass movement. Later on this modeling will be extended to the quasi-stationary creep phase and the transition from creeping to rapid sliding.
   Four large landslides within the crystalline rocks of the Eastern Alps have been investigated since 1997. Two of them are evaluated so far, and are presented in this paper. The largest one is the Kofels landslide with a total volume of 3.9 km(3) and a potential energy release of 5 x 10(16) Joule. Refraction and reflection multi-component seismic techniques were used to resolve structure and elastic parameters of the landslide masses. For the modeling of the initial phase of the landslides by the Finite Element Method a strain softening behavior of the rock mass has been assumed. The development of softened or fractured zones was successfully simulated, in agreement with the structures obtained by the seismic measurements.

DE catalogs; seismicity; tsunamis; volcanoes; historical data errors
AB The primary use of the natural hazards data archived at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and co-located World Data Center for Solid Earth Geophysics (WDC for SEG) is for the mitigation of future disasters. Among the responsibilities of NGDC/WDC for SEG is archiving and disseminating hazards data to city planners, educators, engineers and others engaged in mitigation efforts (approximately 150,000 users per week on our web site). Therefore, it is the purpose of this paper to educate the hazards' community about some of the limitations of these data. It is hoped that enlightened users would have a greater appreciation of data errors and possible sources of misinterpretation of the data.
   Personnel at NGDC/WDC for SEG are in a unique position to discuss the limitations of hazards data since we compile data from original and secondary sources. We are also in direct contact with the data users and know the applications that they make of hazard data, and the misjudgments that often occur when data limitations are not known.
   Most hazard catalogs cover periods of less than 200 years and are reasonably complete and accurate for only the past 20 to 50 years. Such catalogs are not sufficient to investigate long term hazard variations. Earthquake, tsunami, and volcano data catalogs, acquired and integrated at NGDC/WDC for SEG, illustrate artificial long-term variations created by cultural and scientific reporting changes, which can introduce unanticipated non-random variations into the catalogs. Inconsistencies are often related to changes in the way magnitudes are calculated, evolving network equipment, and network discontinuities of operation and personnel, among other error sources.
   Before statistical hazard studies can be done, catalogs need to be clearly understood to identify systematic patterns of an observational nature.

AB A new satellite communication system specifically designed for low-rate data applications has been developed and prototyped. A validation project is proposed to install a pilot network to be operated for 6 months. One of the target markets related to volcanoes, has been selected, so that a group of users is integrated in the project. A specific application for this market will be developed regarding data acquisition, processing, storage and dissemination to distant users. The feasibility of using the new satellite system to provide a new Eutelsat service for low-rate data applications, will be evaluated from the performance of the pilot network. The system of automatic acquisition, field storage and communication with the local control center is already functioning, as well as the circulation of information via Internet. The development of the application and transmission via satellite to distant users is still in an evaluation phase for the volcanoes of Timanfaya (Lanzarote, Canary Island), Vesuvius (Naples) and Sete Cidades Caldera (Sao Miguel, Azores Islands).

TI World map of natural hazards - A global view of the distribution and
   intensity of significant exposures
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
LA English

   insurance; GIS; digital cartography
AB Natural hazards are becoming increasingly significant these days. There is a need for documentation that concisely presents the type and magnitude of natural hazards as an aid to political and economic decision making. With the aim of presenting the global distribution of exposure to the most significant natural hazards as objectively as possible, Munich Re's Geoscience Research Group published its first World Map of Natural Hazards in 1978. After being revised in 1988, the map was completely reworked and extensively expanded in 1998. The results of earlier work and the latest findings in scientific literature were drawn together and presented in a form that practitioners find both accessible and - bearing in mind the needs of the insurance technicians in particular - readily usable.
   In the production of this third edition, all the basic data were for the first time recorded, adjusted, and analysed with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS). The resulting map in DIN A0 format (841x: 1189mm) and the 30-cm globe were produced exclusively with the techniques of digital cartography.
   A main map and four auxiliary maps present the following types of hazards together with background information:
   . Earthquake and vulcanism (shaking risk, Mexico-City-effect, tsunami, volcanic activity, plate tectonics).
   . Windstorm (tropical cyclone, extratropical storm, regional storm, tornado, hail, and lightning).
   . Flood (storm surge, severe rainfall).
   . Marine hazards (high waves, pack ice, and iceberg drift).
   . Effects of El Nino and climate change.
   In particular, hazard information has been stated, as far as possible, as numbers which can be checked and be used directly in insurance calculations. Hazard is often understood as a quantity that relates the occurrence/frequency and intensity of an event to a specific time interval and so is usually expressed in terms of a probability. Whenever possible, therefore, the hazard information on the world map has three essential components - intensity, frequency and reference period.
   The map comes with an accompanying brochure, which contains a description of the methods and scales used as well as a comprehensive catalogue of major natural catastrophes throughout the world.
   A considerably extended CD-ROM version of the World Map of Natural Hazards with numerous additional functionalities is also available now.

ID GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIMULATIONS; IMPACTS
AB Eastern and southern Africa is a region beset with often unique climatic and developmental problems as well as with a high agricultural water usage. This paper presents a synthesis of water as a vulnerable and variable natural resource in space and time under present climatic conditions by assessing various rainfall, evaporation and runoff indices in the region. Further uncertainties regarding this already high-risk natural environment are compounded by superimposing elements of potential climate change for a year 2050 scenario over the region. To the hazards of present and potential future climates the human dimension is added by assessing water demand as well as water availability for present and assumed future conditions. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for more detailed secondary and higher-order impact studies of climate change on water resources.

AB Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental persistent contaminants giving rise to potential health hazard. Some PCBs exert dioxin-like activities mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Although reports on interaction with other nuclear receptors are sparce, some congeners are hypothesized to possess endocrine disruptive potential. Here we present evidence that the three PCBs most abundant in biological extracts, 2,2',3'4,4',5-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB # 138), 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB # 153), and 2,2',3,4,4',5,5'-heptachlorobiphenyl (PCB # 180) have pleiotropic effects on the estrogen- and androgen-receptor. In MCF-7 cells a slightly increased cell proliferation was observed at low concentrations (1-10 nM) in cells co-treated with 0.01 nM 17 beta -Estradiol. whereas the compounds inhibited cell growth significantly at 1 and 10 muM. In reporter gene (ERE-tk-CAT) analysis the three congeners exhibited a significantly estrogen receptor-ligand mediated decrease of the chloramphenicol transferase activity in both control and 10 nM 17 beta -estradiol induced MCF-7 cells. In addition, PCB # 138 elicited a dose-dependent antagonistic effect on androgen receptor activity in transiently co-transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells with an IC50, of 6.2 muM. In summary, this study indicate that the di-ortho, multiple-chloro substituted biphenyls, PCB # 138, PCB # 153 and PCB # 180, can compete with the binding of the natural ligand to two nuclear receptors and thus possess the ability to interfere with sexual hormone regulated processes.

AB Although the Breslow thickness provides the most important histologic information for prognosis in cutaneous melanoma, controversies and uncertainty remain about how best to use thickness. It is unclear whether cutpoints should be used, or if they are used, which are optimal. We studied new data collected from more than 1, 000 patients followed up for a relatively long period. From Cox proportional hazards models of survival we learned that more cut points provide more prognostic information than using, for example, just I cutpoint at 1.7 mm. Nevertheless, a continuous transformation provides an effective alternative that captures the information that thickness provides, and it avoids the pitfalls of using multiple cutpoints. In a multivariate model, this transformation provided strong prognostic information, and the result produced a prognostic score for cutaneous melanoma. This score provides a practical way that Cox model results can be used, and we believe it consolidates the prognostic information provided by traditional histologic and clinical variables. When newer prognostic variables are introduced, we suggest that they be used with this continuous transformation of thickness rather than with cutpoints in thickness.

TI The natural history of hepatitis D virus infection in Illinois state
   facilities for the developmentally disabled

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the natural history of hepatitis D virus infection in an institutionalized, developmentally disabled population and to identify other prognostic factors.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 231 hepatitis B virus carriers, 65 of whom were also infected with hepatitis D virus, at thirteen Illinois state facilities for the developmentally disabled. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from 1986 to 1998 were obtained by chart review. Cox regression analysis was used to compare those with and without hepatitis D virus infection in terms of overall mortality, mortality from hepatic disease, and risk of developing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and to identify other potential prognostic factors.
   RESULTS: Residents with hepatitis D virus infection were more likely to die of liver disease than uninfected residents (11% vs 0.6%, respectively; relative hazard, 15.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-126.6), although there was no significant difference in overall mortality. Twenty-one percent of residents with hepatitis D virus infection were diagnosed to have cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis compared with 9% of those uninfected (relative hazard 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.2). Among the other variables tested, none was predictive of risk of dying of liver disease, and only seropositivity for hepatitis B e antigen was predictive of risk of developing cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis.
   CONCLUSIONS: In an institutionalized, developmentally disabled population of hepatitis B virus carriers, hepatitis D virus infection is associated with a greater risk of liver-associated mortality and of developing chronic liver disease than that associated with hepatitis B virus carriage alone.

TI The work environment impact assessment: A methodologic framework for
   evaluating health-based interventions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE work environment; impact assessment; intervention; intervention research
ID MICE
AB Background A new conceptual framework is needed to evaluate health-based interventions based on the premise that like the environment, workplaces are complex ecologies. The proposed Work Environment Impact Assessment (WEIA) is analogous to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), a concept and method developed 30 years ago in the environmental policy arena to evaluate potential consequences of human activity for the natural environment. WEIA entails identifying and evaluating both intended and unintended consequences, or outcomes, associated with a particular intervention. Because the workplace is a complex ecology, changes in one aspect may lead to changes in other aspects. WEIA calls for a systematic and comprehensive approach to the total work environment.
   Methods To illustrate the utility of WEIA we use this approach to evaluate an intervention to reduce the public's exposure to the pesticide Alar(R), which had been used on apples until it was withdrawn from the market in 1989.
   Results While this intervention did indeed reduce the public's exposure to Alar, it also led to other unintended consequences, namely new ergonomic hazards for apple pickers, increased stress levels in the orchards for both pickers and growers, as well as new worker and perhaps public, exposure to potent neurotoxins.
   Conclusions The goal of using WEIA is not to engage in a risk-risk debate that stalls worthwhile interventions. Rather we propose that by conducting a Work Environment Impact Assessment, all possible positive and negative "ripple" effects stemming from an intervention can be considered, so that the intervention can be designed to achieve maximum benefit.

AB The specific radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 have been determined by gamma ray spectrometry with an HPGe detector in clay brick samples from kiln sites located in 17 towns. The average values of the measured activities are 35, 72, and 585 Bq kg(-1), respectively, for the above radionuclides. The average estimated radium equivalent concentration is 183 Bq kg(-1) and is comparable with reported values for many countries in the world. This value and the value obtained from the criteria formula suggest that the use of local clay bricks do not pose a radiological hazard. The calculated average absorbed dose rate in air within buildings was found to be 102 nCy h(-1) while the population weighted indoor annual effective dose was 0.20 mSv. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Frequent latex glove use is a risk factor for the development of latex allergy. With the increase in latex glove use, latex allergy has become more prevalent. There are a number of occupational groups in which the use of latex gloves is both inappropriate and even hazardous, including food handlers, where the hazard relates particularly to their latex-sensitive customers. The aim of this study was to assess both the use of latex gloves by food handlers and the impact of an intervention study on reducing latex grove use. This was done at the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, Australia. We found that 10 out of 30 stalls (33%) used latex gloves, and that following a short education program, this was reduced to 1 stall (3%, p=0.006). The potential to reduce latex glove use by using this intervention study was 93% (95% confidence interval of 54% - 100%). We recommend that food handlers be educated during their training, not only about hygiene issues, but also about the appropriate type of grove to wear, in order to prevent both the development of a new occupational group at risk of becoming allergic to latex, but more importantly to protect their latex-sensitive customers.

AB The use of chemical deicers such as sodium chloride (NaCl) has increased significantly during the past three decades. Deicers induce metal corrosion and alter the physicochemical properties of soils and water. Environmental damage caused by the use of NaCl has prompted government agencies to find alternative deicers. This article presents a comparative ecotoxicological study of three deicers on soil organisms. Sodium formiate (NaFo) and calcium-magnesium acetate (CMA) are the most interesting commercially available deicers based upon their characteristics and potential toxicity. Organisms used in this study were four species of macrophytes (cress (Lepidium sativum), barley (Ordeum vulgare), red fescue grass (Festuca rubra), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis)) and an invertebrate (Eisenia fetida). Using standardized and modified methods, the relative toxicity of deicers was CMA<NaFo <congruent to> NaCl. The results demonstrate that these chemicals could have similar imparts in terrestrial environments since similar quantities of NaFo and greater amounts of CMA are necessary to achieve the same efficiency as NaCl. The toxicity of the tested substances was lower in natural composted soil than in artificial substrate (silica or OECD soil), indicating decreased environmental bioavailability. The response of the organisms changed according to endpoint, species, and soil characteristics (artificial substrate as compared to natural organic soil). The most sensitive endpoint measured was macrophyte growth with Kentucky bluegrass being the most sensitive species. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Different polluted water samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant, agricultural drainage canals, the River Nile, and irrigation canals. The samples were examined for the enumeration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Sohag area, Egypt over a period of one year. A total of 240 isolates were collected and tested for their resistance to 12 common antibiotics and 6 heavy metals. The isolates were found to be less resistant to norfloxacin (1.7%), ofloxacin (4.6%), amikacin (9.6%), tobramycin (10.4), carbenicillin (15.4), and gentamycin (41.3%), yet more sensitive to rifampicin (75%), kanamycin (89.6%), ampicillin (90.8%), chloramphenicol (91.7%), streptomycin (92.9%), and tetracyclin (96.3%). In contrast, 7.1%, 12.9%, 25.4%, and 53.7% of the isolates were resistant to lead, cadmium, mercury, and zinc, respectively. None of the isolates had developed a resistance to silver or molybdenum. The high frequency of metal-antibiotic double resistance existed between lead and amikacin (56.5%), cadmium and ofloxacin (72.7%), zinc and norfloxacin (100%), and mercury and carbenicillin (94.6%). The high occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural water could be related to the widespread use of antibiotics, with possible public health hazard.

ID BLOOD-PRESSURE INDEX; INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to delineate the natural history of claudication and determine risk factors for death.
   Methods: We reviewed the key outcomes (death, revascularization, amputation) in 2777 male patients with claudication identified over 15 years at a Veterans Administration hospital with both clinical and noninvasive criteria. Patients with rest pain or ulcers were excluded. Data were analyzed with life-table and Cox hazard models.
   Results: The mean follow-up was 47 months. The cohort exhibited a mortality rate of 12% per year, which was significantly (P < .05) more than the age-adjusted US male population. Among the deaths in which the cause was known, 66% were due to heart disease. We examined several baseline risk factors in a multivariate Cox model, four were significant (P < .01) independent predictors of death: older age (relative risk [RR] = 1.3 per decade), lower ankle-brachial index (RR = 1.2 for 0.2 change), diabetes requiring medication (RR = 1.4), and stroke (RR = 1.4). The model can be used to estimate the mortality rate for specific patients. Surprisingly, a history of angina and myocardial infarction mas nota significant predictor. Major and minor amputations had a 10-year cumulative rate less than 10%. Revascularization procedures occurred with a 10-year cumulative rate of 18%.
   Conclusions: We found a high mortality rate in this large cohort and four independent risk factors that have a large impact on survival. Risk stratification with our model may be useful in determining an overall therapeutic plan for claudicants. A history of angina and myocardial infarction was not a useful predictor of death, suggesting that many patients in our cohort presented with claudication before having coronary artery symptoms. Our data also indicate that claudicants have a low risk of major amputation at 10-year follow-up.

AB As a state authorized to permit hazardous waste combustion facilities, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has conducted several site-specific, multipathway risk assessments in support of permitting actions. These risk assessments were carried out in accordance with guidance provided in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Human Health Risk Assessment Protocol for Hazardous Waste Combustion Facilities, Peer Review Draft (HHRAP). This protocol uses a prospective, screening-level, risk assessment paradigm and incorporates conservative default assumptions. In conducting such risk assessments, staff of the Toxicology and Risk Assessment Section have found that modeled emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at concentrations near or below detectable levels can produce unacceptable risk in the "farmer" exposure scenario. In accordance with recommendations in HHRAP, the TNRCC followed a tiered approach, whereby additional site-specific information is incorporated in place of standard default assumptions in cases where the initial screening-level risk assessment yielded unacceptable risk or hazard. Sensitivity analyses indicated that one of the key parameters affecting the risk estimates for PAHs in the farmer exposure scenario was the way in which PAHs were modeled up through the food chain. Therefore, refinement of the model focused on the development of a PAM-specific metabolism factor, as described in the article.

ID FATALITIES; RISK
AB This study presents an evaluation of the risks due to the physical hazards associated with two remedial alternatives for a former chemical manufacturing facility in New Jersey. Both the on-site and off-site risk of work-related fatalities during remedy implementation and the risks of accident or accident-related fatalities during the off-site transport of site-related materials were evaluated. The two remedial alternatives evaluated were on-site containment and excavation with off-site incineration. The risk of at least one fatality due to a work-related accident was estimated for on-site activities associated with each remedial alternative, and for off-site incineration. The risks of at least one accident and of one accident-related fatality were calculated with accident and fatality data from the U.S, Department of Transportation. In addition, the risk of at least one accident that might potentially affect a natural resource (e,g,. river, lake, or national park) was evaluated. This evaluation Indicates that the risk of a work-related fatality is over an order of magnitude higher, and the risk of an accident or accident-related fatality is over three orders of magnitude higher, for the excavation/off-site incineration remedial alternative than for the on-site containment alternative. Overall, this study indicates that the physical hazards associated with excavation and off-site incineration are much greater than those associated with on-site containment for this site. Therefore, if a choice be tween the two remedial alternatives were to be made based solely on physical hazards and accident risk. the on-site containment alternative would be more protective of human health and the environment than the excavation/off-site incineration alternative.

AB The SAFRAN/Crocus/MEPRA software is used to assess the climatology of the avalanche hazard and its sensitivity to climate change. A natural avalanche-hazard index based on MEPRA analysis is defined and validated against natural avalanche observations (triggered avalanches are not taken into account). A 15 year climatology then allows a comparison of avalanche hazard in the different French massifs. Finally, a simple climate scenario (with a general increase of precipitation and temperature) shows that avalanche hazard may decrease slightly in winter (mainly February) and more significantly in May/June. The relative proportion of wet-snow avalanches increases.

AB A physiologically based toxicokinetic (PB-TK) model for fish, incorporating chemical exchange at the gill and accumulation in five tissue compartments, was parameterized and evaluated for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Individual-based model parameterization was used to examine the effect of natural variability in physiological, morphological, and physico-chemical parameters on model predictions. The PB-TK model was used to predict uptake of organic chemicals across the gill and accumulation in blood and tissues in lake trout. To evaluate the accuracy of the model, a total of 13 adult lake trout were exposed to waterborne 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE), pentachloroethane (PCE), and hexachloroethane (HCE), concurrently, for periods of 6, 12, 24 or 48 h. The measured and predicted concentrations of TCE, PCE and HCE in expired water, dorsal aortic blood and tissues were generally within a factor of two, and in most instances much closer. Variability noted in model predictions, based on the individual-based model parameterization used in this study, reproduced variability observed in measured concentrations. The inference is made that parameters influencing variability in measured blood and tissue concentrations of xenobiotics are included and accurately represented in the model. This model contributes to a better understanding of the fundamental processes that regulate the uptake and disposition of xenobiotic chemicals in the lake trout. This information is crucial to developing a better understanding of the dynamic relationships between contaminant exposure and hazard to the lake trout. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

DE hail; hailpads networks; natural hazards; climatology; GIS (gridmapping)
AB Within the framework of a doctoral thesis in geography, we endeavored to draw up the first: map showing hail risk in France. The creation of this map is mainly based on the data of hail measuring networks. This map is corroborated, moreover, by the analysis of hail damage maps. Insurance data used to measure relative hail damage are the base premium rate levels expressed as a percentage of assets insured on a single crop, in this case grapes. These levels reflect well, over the long term, the regional hierarchy of damage, without it being necessary to correlate them directly in terms of frequency and intensity of hail. The regions that suffer the most hail stretch from the southwest to the east-central area of France, passing through the Massif Central. One must also note the southern Alps as a strongly hail-prone region. From the diagonal line of high hail risk emerge two gradients of decreasing intensity and frequency of hail. Toward the west, the risk of hail diminishes strongly, attaining a minimum level in Brittany and on the English Channel coast. Toward the southeast, hail diminishes near the Mediterranean coast. The climatological explanations of this map are so far only hypotheses. Hail is not the exclusive feature of a single climate; it seems on the contrary to be the hallmark of regions of climatic contact. The line of maximal hail risk is situated at the frontier between the oceanic and Mediterranean influences. This conflict is readily measurable in the southwest part of France where the pyrenees channel the Mediterranean influences at low levels. The map of hail risk is also the reflection of the probability of southwestern Row at high altitudes. In the east-central area of France (around Lyon), the local topography can amplify hail energy especially on leeward slopes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geomagnetic variations of partly interplanetary origin, with cyclic signatures in human affairs and pathology include the incidence of various diseases, regarding which this study of healthy subjects attempted to determine an underlying mechanism by worldwide archival and physiological monitoring, notably of heart rate variability (HRV). In the past half-century, the possible health and other hazards of natural, solar variability-driven temporal variations in the earth's magnetic field have become a controversial subject in view of the inconsistent results. Some well-documented claims of associations between geomagnetic storms and myocardial infarction or stroke have been rejected by a study based on more comprehensive data analyzed by rigorous methods - covering, however, only part of a solar cycle in only part of a hemisphere. It seems possible that inter-solar cycle and geographic variability, if not geographic differences, may account for discrepancies. Herein, we examine the start of a planetary study on any influence of geomagnetic disturbances that are most pronounced in the auroral oval, on human HRV. The magnetic field variations exhibit complex spectra and include the frequency band between 0.001-10 Hz, which is regarded as ultra-low frequency by physicists. Since the 'ultra-low-frequency' range, like other endpoints used in cardiology, refers to much higher frequencies than the about-yearly changes that are here shown to play a role in environmental-organismic interactions revealed by HRV, the current designations used in cardiology are all placed in quotation marks to indicate the need for possible revision. Whether or not this suggestion has an immediate response, we have pointed to a need for the development of instrumentation and software that renders the assessment of circadian, infradian and even infra-annual (truly low frequency) modulations routinely feasible. HRV was examined on the basis of nearly continuous 7-day records by ECG between December 10, 1998, and November 2, 2000, on 19 clinically healthy subjects, 21 to 54 years of age, in Alta, Norway. A geomagnetic record was obtained from the Aurora[ Observatory of the University of Tromso. First, frequency-domain measures of HRV were compared for each person in 24-hour spans of high geomagnetic disturbance versus quiet conditions. Second, cross-spectra between geomagnetic activity and HRV measures were quantified via the squared coherence spectrum using 7-day time series. A 7.5% increase in the 24-hour average of heart rate, HR (P = 0.00020) and a decrease in HRV were documented on days of high geomagnetic disturbance. The decrease in HRV was validated statistically for the 'total frequency', 'TF' endpoint (18.6% decrease, P = 0.00009). The decrease in spectral power was found primarily in the 'circaminutan frequency', 'VLF' (21.9% decrease, P < 0.000001) in conjunction with the 'minutes-to-hours' component, ultra-low-frequency, 'ULF' (15.5% decrease, P = 0.00865) and circadecasecundan 'low frequency', 'LF' (14.2% decrease, P = 0.00187) regions of the spectrum. Power-law scaling of the power spectra did not show any statistically significant difference. It is noteworthy that most of the decrease in HRV, except for the circaminutan (VLF) component, was observed only in the season in which sunshine alternated with darkness (D/L), a finding suggesting a mechanism influenced by the alternation of light and darkness.
   The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception was also supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged coherence at frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations (with periods ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed with a statistical significance (P < 0.000001) among the three natural lighting conditions, the association being weaker during L/L or D/D than during D/L. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of the circadian and circasemidian frequencies in relation to the alternation of sunshine with darkness or rather circannual rhythm stage. In conclusion, evidence is provided herein that an alteration of HRV is most apparent in the circaminutan ('VLF') region, which is clinically important, because a reduction in its power is a predictor of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The circadecasecundan ('LF') component of HRV also decreased in association with geomagnetic disturbance, which may reflect an episodic alteration of arterial pressure related to changes in geomagnetic activity. Lastly, our study suggests the existence of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception mechanism in humans involving mainly the Pc 6 band of the magnetic field.

AB In this study, 339 patients (154 men, 185 women) with a median age of 74 years (range 23-97) admitted to the Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology in 1986, have been followed up for 14 years. The diagnoses were intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; 30, 8.8%), cardioembolic cerebral infarction (CE, 71, 20.9%), lacunar infarction (LI; 47, 13.9%) and atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI; 191, 56.3%). The cumulative probabilities of recurrent stroke rates at 1-, 5- and 10-year follow-ups were 13.5% (95% confidence interval, Cl, 9.6-17.4), 38.7% (95% Cl 32.6-44.8) and 53.9% (95% Cl 46.7-61.1). According to Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, age, severity of stroke, previous stroke and systolic blood pressure are each of importance in predicting recurrent stroke. During the observation period, 290 patients (85.5%) died. The mortality rate of 24.5% during the first year was 4.5 times higher compared to the normal population of the same age and gender. Patients with LI had lower mortality rates compared to ICH by the log rank test (p = 0.0275); to CE (p = 0.000) and to ACI (p = 0.049). Thirty-nine percent of all vascular deaths after the first year were caused by recurrent strokes. Fatal index/recurrent stroke occurred statistically more frequently in the CE group versus the non-CE one (p = 0.005). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that age, severity of stroke, previous stroke, heart failure and fasting blood glucose exceeding 6 mmol/l or history of diabetes were each predictors of mortality. In conclusion, this study has shown the worse outcomes for all subtypes of stroke compared to the normal population and also clearly pointed out independent predictors of recurrent stroke or death at the time of diagnosis.

AB Probably the first radiographic study of human fossils, that by D. Gorganovic-Kramberger on Neandertal remains from Krapina, Croatia, was published in 1906, only II years after Rontgen announced the discovery of X-rays. Many subsequent studies on fossil hominids used regular clinical diagnostic radiological apparatus, as depicted in Atlas of Radiographs of Early Man by M.F. Skinner and G.H. Sperber (1982). Some specimens such as crania filled with heavily calcified matrix proved intractable. Ordinary radiographs of such specimens usually failed to reveal endocranial structure, as fossilized bone and calcified endocast were approximately equally radio-opaque. Thus, neither endocranial volume nor structural details were delectable. The only invasive method that could have been employed involved mechanical removal of the solid matrix, but this entailed hazards to the cranial vault and the destruction of the natural endocranial cast In 1983-1984, G.C. Conroy and M. Vannier utilized recent advances in high-resolution computed tomography to produce non-invasive, intracranial capacity measurements of matrix-filled fossil skulls. They tried the method on two fossil mammal skulls filled with hard sandstone matrix (1984, Science 26:456-458), and then successfully applied it to a South African, matrix-filled cranium of the ancient hominid (hominin) species, Australopithecus africanus from Makapansgat (Conroy et al 1990, Science 247:838-841). Details of the morphology of the endocranial surface of the braincase were revealed, including the pattern of venous sinus drainage in the posterior cranial fossa. A group based in SI. Louis, Vienna, Paris, Rome, and Johannesburg has taken such studies further. Beautiful "virtual endocasts" have been. produced on a large male specimen of A. africanus from Sterkfontein, South Africa, and the endocranial capacity has been determined (1998). The methods make it possible to re-create "virtual endocasts" of ancient: hominids. Clin. Anat. 14:134-141, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB A review of modelling methods of structural elements with failures (cracks and delaminations) is presented. The review is focused on the models of delaminations for composite structures. Cracks appear in both isotropic and anisotropic materials. Delamination is one of the most important failure modes of laminated composite materials. Delamination may originate during manufacturing or may be induced during in-service loading, such as by foreign object impact or by fatigue. Common damage in composite materials is matrix cracking, fibre breakage, fibre-matrix debonding, and delamination between plies. Delamination introduced during the manufacturing process or produced by impact and other service hazards may substantially reduce the stiffness and buckling load of the structure, thus influencing the vibration and stability characteristics.
   The following models have been described: continuos, discrete-continuos and discrete. The consequences of modelling, and finally their accuracy are also discussed.

AB Large areas of abandoned tin-mining pools have found secondary uses which provide natural habitats for aquaculture activities where most freshwater fishes are bred. Soils from tin-mining areas are rich in uranium and thorium. A study has been conducted on the status of waters and aquatic habitats in disused tin-mining pools and at water intake points for public drinking water supply to assess the presence of natural radionuclides and arsenic which are potential health hazards. The concentrations of uranium and thorium were determined by gamma spectrometry. Arsenic species were preconcentrated with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate in chloroform and were later irradiated in a neutron Aux of 5.1 x 10(12) n cm(-2) s(-1) of a TRIGA Mk.II nuclear reactor to induce radioactivity due to the As-76 radionuclide. The concentrations of uranium were found to be relatively lower than thorium whereas the As(III) species have almost similar concentrations with the oxidized form of As(V). The determination of radium from water samples taken from water intake points as well as treated water was done by co-precipitation separation with mixed barium carrier followed by reprecipitation using sulphuric acid. Results obtained showed that the average concentration of Ra-226 for raw water is 3.34 pCi l(-1) compared to about 0.89 pCi l(-1) for treated water samples. These figures are well below the maximum permissible level of 5 pCi l(-1) for drinking water, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High-mountain environment becomes gradually the attractive place for various forms of the investments. Naturally, that is not a new (neither unexpected) trend. The specific, and simultaneously the weak feature of the Tatra Mts is their insular position, since they have no equivalent from north, cast, and even from west. Among the adverse factors belongs also a relatively small area of the mountains, especially the valley systems that arc generally the most attacked by humans, due to their accessibility and hiking possibilities. The Tatra Mts lie in the field of view and interest of two gradually developing post-socialist countries (Poland and Slovakia). They have already prepared plans and particular projects for an intensive development of tourism in this area. Business and political lobby groups both latently and clearly manifest their interest in commercial utilisation of the Tatra Mts. In the paper we mention the significance of geomorphologic research and its applications for more worthwhile landscape-ecological analysis, synthesis, planning, and control of the landscape environment utilisation. Especially in the high-mountain landscape, close to timberline, the georelief attributes (static and dynamic) belong to the main limiting factors for human activity. A natural hazard assessment of actual or potential processes requires existing knowledge about the activity (intensity) of the process, procured either by direct observations (measurements) or by using simplified models combined with aerial or space photograph analysis. The measured (or calculated) parameters should be processed into a database information system. The evaluating process includes analyse of defined spatial units (morphodynamic systems), which is based on two types of criteria: criteria resulting from the human demands and interests (and conversely impacts, influences etc.), and criteria resulting from the proper dynamics of natural processes (and influences of natural conditions on each process). The hazard assessment in high-mountain area is often complicated by the risks related with the concrete estimation of losses and also casualties. Nevertheless, it becomes a component of the indicators for sustainable utilisation of natural resources.

AB Steep terrain and the high frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. For example, more than 800 slope failures were triggered by a rainstorm in November 1993 on Lantau island, Hong Kong. Maps of recent landslides interpreted from aerial photographs, in combination with a geographical information system, were used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of landslides, with particular reference to such physical parameters as lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, vegetation cover, and proximity to drainage line, all of which are considered to be influential in the occurrence of landslides. A stepwise logistic regression model was obtained between landslide susceptibility and the above mentioned physical parameters. The study area has been classified into five classes of relative landslide susceptibility, namely. very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, based on this methodology.

ID GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
AB During the past two decades there have been a wide range of applications for decision-making linking multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and geographic information systems (GIS). However, limited literature reports the development of MCE-GIS software, and the comparison of various MCE-GIS approaches. This paper introduces an MCE-GIS program called MCE-RISK for risk-based decision-making. It consists of a series of modules for data standardisation, weighting, MCE-GIS methods. and sensitivity analysis. The program incorporates different MCE-GIS methods. including weighted linear combination (WLC), the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and compromise programming (CP), enabling comparisons between different methods for the same decision problem to be made. An example of decision-making for determining priority areas for a bushfire hazard reduction burning is examined. After implementing the alternative MCE-GIS methods, and comparing final outputs and the computational difficulty involved in the analysis, WLC is recommended. Some caveats on using MCE-GIS methods art: also dis cussed. Although the development of MCE-RISK and its application reported in this paper are specific to risk-based decisionmaking in natural hazards, the program can be used for other environmental decision applications. such as environmental impact assessment and land-use planning.

ID DROUGHT CONDITIONS; YIELD
AB Globally speaking, the world would require one billion metric tons of wheat in the year 2020 as compared to the current production of 600 million metric tons. These figures, when translated into productivity parameters, mean that the current wheat global average yield of 2.5 t/ha. must shift to roughly 4 t/ha, in the 2020. Can this be achieved? Optimistically speaking, this projection can be met provided there is continuous support and investment in agricultural science and research, especially in conventional plant breeding, integrated pest management including soil health, improved seed multiplication and distribution, system, optimum and efficient use of inputs. Furthermore, mechanization of farming systems and supporting pricing policies to farmers are necessary for continuing production increases. I believe that, an invigorated research program on redesigning of wheat plant, discovery and assembly of hybrid vigour, efficient management of water and drought, genetically superior system of uptake and translocation of nutrients, suitable germplasm adapted to conservation tillage practices, durable and multiple disease resistance in wheat and transgenics would insure a superior germplasm base from which future cultivars with high and stable yield potential would be made available to the farmers. Germplasm and genetic resources would remain paramount. However, every precaution is warranted to preserve the natural resource base and soil nutrient balance, so that the future agricultural system is guaranteed with minimum hazard to environment.

AB In a series of papers, Ames and col leagues allege that the scientific and public health communities have perpetuated a series of 'misconceptions' that resulted in inaccurate identification of chemicals that pose potential human cancer risks, and misguided cancer prevention strategies and regulatory policies. They conclude that exposures to industrial and synthetic chemicals represent negligible cancer risks and that animal studies have little or no scientific value for assessing human risks, Their conclusions are based on flawed and untested assumptions. For instance, they claim that synthetic residues on food can be ignored because 99.99% of pesticides humans eat are natural, chemicals in plants are pesticides, and their potential to cause cancer equals that of synthetic pesticides. Similarly, Ames does not offer any convincing scientific evidence to justify discrediting bioassays for identifying human carcinogens. Ironically, their arguments center on a ranking procedure that relies on the same experimental data and extrapolation methods they criticize as being unreliable for evaluating cancer risks. We address their inconsistencies and flaws, and present scientific facts and our perspectives surrounding Ames' nine alleged misconceptions. Our conclusions agree with the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the National Toxicology Program, and other respected scientific organizations: in the absence of human data, animal studies are the most definitive for assessing human cancer risks, Animal data should not be ignored, and precautions should be taken to lessen human exposures, Dismissing animal carcinogenicity findings would lead to human cancer cases as the only means of demonstrating carcinogenicity of environmental agents. This is unacceptable public health policy.

AB Natural hazards are mostly related to the activation of combined geomorphological and geological processes that control landform development. The study area is located in the NE part of Peloponnese (Corinthos prefecture). It is a typical agricultural area with intense relief, the result of active tectonics and important human intervention. This study demonstrates the benefits from the synergism of SAR data (ERS-2) and optical data (SPOT2-XS) in order to highlight the possible natural-hazard-prone areas. These data give different and complementary information since the radar signal depends mostly on topography, surface roughness and soil moisture, whereas the visible/infrared channels provide spectral information mostly on vegetation and land use/cover. The application presented here was focused on the enhancement of the high erosion risk, areas, the improvement of the terrain interpretation, the mapping and highlighting of the landform morphology, and a more accurate determination of the main factors that control the flooding risk of Corinthos town.

AB Sea level is projected to rise between 13 and 94 cm over the next 100 yr due to continued climate warming. The sea-level projections assume that polar ice sheets will remain stable or even increase on time scales of centuries, but controversial geologic evidence suggests that current polar ice sheets have been eliminated or greatly reduced during previous Pleistocene interglacials indicating that modern polar ice sheets have become unstable within the natural range of interglacial climates. Sea level may have been more than 20 m higher than today during a presumably very warm interglacial about 400 ka during marine isotope stage 11. Because of the implications for future sea level rise, additional study of the conflicting evidence for warmer conditions and higher sea level during marine isotope stage 11 is needed. Here we present microfossil and isotopic data from marine sediments of the Cariaco Basin supporting the interpretation that global sea level was 10-20 m higher than today during marine isotope stage 11. The increased sea level requires reduction in modern polar ice sheets and is consistent with the interpretation that the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet were absent or greatly reduced during marine isotope stage 11. Our results show a warm marine isotope stage 11 interglacial climate with sea level as high as or above modern sea level that lasted for 25 to 30 k.y. Variations in Earth's orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cycles) are considered to be a primary external force driving glacial-interglacial cycles. Current and marine isotope stage 11 Milankovitch forcing are very similar, suggesting that the present interglacial (Holocene) that began ca. 10 ka will continue for another 15 to 20 k.y. Therefore any anthropogenic climate warming will accelerate the natural process toward reduction in polar ice sheets. The potential for increased rates of sea level rise related to polar ice sheet decay should be considered as a potential natural hazard on centennial time scales.

AB Background and aims-We investigated the influence of baseline characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on prognosis and developed a multivariate Cox model predicting survival. All patients were from Central Europe.
   Methods-All 245 patients seen at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of Vienna, Austria, from July 1991 to March 1998 were included in this retrospective study. Nineteen different clinical characteristics and survival time from date of diagnosis were noted. Factors determining survival time were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression models and a new classification model was constructed. The validity of this model was tested on an independent group of 89 patients, seen from April 1998 to September 1999.
   Results-Median survival in patients with HCC was 8.0 months. In a multivariate analysis bilirubin (>2 mg/dl), portal vein thrombosis, prothrombin time (<70%), alpha fetoprotein (>180 mug/l), tumour mass >50%, and enlarged lymph nodes were independent predictors of survival. A newly constructed Cox proportional hazard model (Vienna survival model for HCC=VISUM-HCC) identified three disease stages with different durations of survival (median survival stage 1, 15.2 months; stage 2, 7.2 months; and stage 3, 2.6 months; p=0.00001). Applying the VISUM-HCC survival model to patients in Okuda stage 2 identified subgroups with an excellent and very poor prognosis for which different treatment modalities should be offered.
   Conclusions-Our patients with HCC had a poor median survival of eight months. Six easily measurable clinical variables were significant predictors of survival in patients with HCC. The new VISUM-HCC survival model may be useful for stratifying patients with HCC for various clinical treatment modalities.

AB This study examined whether the prostaglandin E-1 analogue misoprostol (400 mug), when placed vaginally at the time of intrauterine insemination (IUI) improves pregnancy rates. A prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized and double-blind study involving 274 women in 494 IUI cycles resulted in a total of 64 pregnancies (13 % per cycle). Misoprostol cycles totalled 253, with 43 pregnancies (17% per cycle), whereas placebo cycles totalled 241, with 21 pregnancies (9% per cycle). The cumulative pregnancy rate with misoprostol treatment was significantly greater than with placebo (P = 0.004, Cox proportional hazards regression). The benefit of misoprostol was seen in clomiphene cycles (14 versus 4%, P = 0.006), and was indicated in FSH cycles (33 versus 15%, borderline significance) and natural cycles (15.6 versus 7.7%, not significant), but was not seen in clomiphene/FSH cycles (18.2 versus 23.5%, not significant). Misoprostol treatment did not increase pain score on the day of IUI (1.1 versus 1.4) and at 1 day post IUI (0.6 versus 0.8). Complications were rare in both groups [six (2%) subject cycles in the misoprostol cycles compared with two (1%) in the placebo group], It is concluded that the use of vaginal misoprostol may improve the chance for pregnancy in women having IUI in a wide variety of cycle types.

AB To investigate the significance of pyrexia and dysphagia as risk factors for mortality at 90 days in patients admitted with an acute stroke when controlled with other confounding factors, 202 stroke patients admitted to acute medical wards were prospectively studied for demographic and neurological details, stroke syndromes and pathology. A number of other factors were recorded within three days of admission, including pyrexia and dysphagia. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to identify the effect of 10 factors on mortality at 90 days; 59 (29%) patients had died by 90 days. Univariate analysis revealed pyrexia and dysphagia to be independently and significantly associated with indices of stroke severity and 90 day mortality (p<0.001 for both). Cox's proportional hazards model, however, revealed that stroke mortality was associated with dysphagia (relative risk 2.6, 95% Cl 1.2-5.4; p=0.009), pre-existing diabetes mellitus (2.4, Cl 1.2-4.5; p=0.006), higher age >75 years (1.8, Cl 1.0-3.1), ischaemic heart disease (2.1, Cl 1.1-4.2, p=0.025), total anterior circulation syndromes (2.8, Cl 1.5-5.2) and previous stroke (1.8, Cl 1.0-3.2, p=0.028). Pyrexia was not a significant factor (p=0.50). Although both pyrexia and dysphagia are associated with higher mortality in acute stroke patients, dysphagia was a significant variable predicting death at 90 days when controlled for other factors known to influence stroke mortality. Pyrexia is not significant when other variables are considered.

AB Objectives. The aims of this study were to identify factors of significance in the development of acute confusional state (ACS) and the differences between patients who developed ACS and those who did not.
   Method and Results. Assessment, observations and interviews with 505 patients admitted to an orthopaedic clinic revealed that 51 patients developed ACS during their in-hospital stay. Patients admitted for hip fracture had a higher incidence of ACS (20.2%) than patients admitted for elective surgery for coxarthros or gonarthros (3.6%). The highest hazard ratio for ACS was several other physical diseases 15.94 (CI: 4.60-55.31 and p-value <0.00001) and the lowest was age 1.10 (CI: 1.04-1.15 and p-value <0.0002). The ACS lasted from 1 to 9 days, and patients had one (N=42), two (N=8) or three episodes (N=1) of confusion during their stay on the ward. More patients who developed ACS before surgery had two or more confusional episodes and emergency patients developed ACS more rapidly. The ACS lasted longer in patients with a higher score on the OBS scale at admittance and with rapid development of ACS.
   Conclusions. Acuteness in the situation seems an important risk indication for ACS in the elderly. Awareness of factors associated with the development of ACS makes it possible to more systematically identify those at risk, for instance by systematic assessment in the first interview with the patient on admission to hospital.

AB Advances in computer technology have made very large databases easily accessible to users and managers. The census and land databases are of enormous use to hazard managers and planners. An extensive literature has identified groups of social, economic and demographic indicators that may be combined with physical and land data to predict and categorise levels of community vulnerability. Impact scenario mapping can be very precise and impressive in its detail, but a range of constraints, such as ageing of the data, the arbitrary nature of boundaries, problems of weighting indicators, and categorisation of vulnerability, impose limitations on the use of socioeconomic indicators to predict community vulnerability.

AB This paper summarises work undertaken at the Natural Hazards Research Centre with regard to the compilation, climatological analysis and loss modelling application of hailstorm data for the greater Sydney region. It discusses the results from two associated research areas: ENSO-related climatological analysis of hailstorm data, and insurance sector oriented risk assessment of hail losses in the Sydney basin. The two complementary projects led to the development of HailAUS, the first hail loss model for a major urban area in Australia. The hazard occurrence module of the hail loss model is based on a comprehensive, good quality hail data set, whose interannual variability has previously been analysed with regard to the ENSO signal. The paper presents the major results of the local hail data climatology, and outlines the structure of the hail loss model. The important practical applications that result from the collection and analysis of good quality climatological data are noted.

AB To develop materials for shielding astronauts from the hazards of GCR, natural Martian surface materials are considered for their potential as radiation shielding for manned Mars missions. The modified radiation fluences behind various kinds of Martian rocks and regolith are determined by solving the Boltzmann equation using NASA Langley's HZETRN code along with the 1977 Solar Minimum galactic cosmic ray environmental model. To develop structural shielding composite materials for Martian surface habitats, theoretical predictions of the shielding properties of Martian regolith/polyimide composites has been computed to assess their shielding effectiveness. Adding high-performance polymer binders to Martian regolith to enhance structural properties also enhances the shielding properties of these composites because of the added hydrogenous constituents. Heavy ion beam testing of regolith simulant/polyimide composites is planned to validate this prediction. Characterization and proton beam tests are performed to measure structural properties and to compare the shielding effects on microelectronic devices, respectively.

AB An annual index measuring past national losses and capable of measuring future loss from weather and climate extremes was developed to help measure future shifts in climate, a subject of great concern to the global warming issue and the insurance industry. Results from climate models indicate that a changed climate owing to global warming would alter and increase many extremes, and the objective of this study was to develop a national-scale index to monitor change in monetary losses and costs from weather and climate extremes. Forty-four historical variables addressing various aspects of weather and climate extremes and their effects on the U.S. economy since the late 1940s were assessed as potential input to such an index. Frequencies of most severe weather conditions from 1950 to 1997 did not correspond well with their financial impacts. However, hurricane losses did correspond with the frequency of intense hurricanes, and tornado losses corresponded well with the number of violent tornadic storms. Quality insurance loss data for several major storm types (thunder, hail, winter, and wind storms) were available, plus quality data on flood and hurricane losses, and all were adjusted to 1997 dollars. Techniques were developed to assess the effect of seasonal climate extremes on major crop yields and costs for electricity and natural gas consumed. Trends were upward for certain key variables between 1950 and 1997, including the incidence and losses associated with winter storms, flood losses, crop losses, and incidence of heavy rains. Trends were downward for other weather-driven loss variables including hurricane losses, energy costs, thunderstorm losses, wind storm losses, and hail losses. Nine loss variables were selected to develop the U.S. annual loss index, and in rank order, based on their average annual loss values, were energy costs, followed by losses from hurricanes, floods, severe convective storms, crops, tornadoes, winter storms, hail, and wind storms. The variables chosen also will be available in future years to allow a continuing assessment using the index. The 1950-1997 average annual index value was $17.47 billion (1997 dollars), with annual values ranging from a high of $54.4 billion in 1972 to a low of $2.4 billion in 1963. The 48-year trend of the index was unchanging with three notable high loss periods: 1950-1954, 1970-1974, and 1990-1994.

AB Wondogenet is located at the Eastern margin of the Main Ethiopian Rift. The geology of the area consists of volcanic rocks (ignimbrites, basalts, tephra) and volcano-lacustrine sediments of Plio-Pleistocene age. Morphoynamic activities have developed rugged and dissected landscape. These have been coupled with frequent heavy precipitation and accelerating human impact to produce frequent landslide problems.
   In this study landslide occurrences and their relationships with various event controlling parameters have been evaluated using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Statistical relationships of these parameters with landslide occurrences were converted into risk susceptibility priority numbers. These numbers were re scaled between 0 and 1for each layer before integrating them into a cumulative risk factor on which the landslide hazard zoning was based.

AB The natural radionuclide contents of some concrete building blocks randomly sampled in the city of Ibadan have been determined using NaI(TI) gamma ray spectrometry. The radionuclides Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were determined with city mean specific activities 47 +/- 21 Bq.kg(-1), 52 +/- 21 Bq.kg(-1), and 352 +/- 222 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. These activities amount to a radium equivalent of about 150 Bq.kg(-1), which is lower than the recommended maximum value of 370 Bq.kg(-1). The mean value of the external hazard index was Found to be 0.41 which implies that the building blocks used in the city of Ibadan are within the acceptable level of radioactivity. The mean indoor gamma dose equivalent to individuals due to the walls was calculated to be 412 mu Sv.y(-1) and the collective dose equivalent 563 man.Sy.y(-1).

ID BUILDING-MATERIALS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB Activity concentration of Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 in local (Atbra and Rabak) and imported cement types (Jordanian, Indonesian and Seabulk) has been measured using high-resolution gamma -spectrometry. The average values obtained for Th-232, Ra-226 and 40K activity concentrations in different cements are lower than the corresponding global values reported in UNSCEAR publications. The radium-equivalent activity (Ra,,) of the samples was calculated and compared with similar data reported in the literature. The comparison has revealed that Ra,, values obtained Fall far below the criterion limit specified for building materials. The potential radiological hazard of the different samples was estimated using different approaches: representative level index and annual dose limit (dose due to gamma radiation inside the room and inhalation of radon). The estimated representative level index for all the samples is less than unity (the upper limit) indicating that the associated gamma radiation level is low. The annual dose limit falls within 0.19 to 0.30 mSv, which is an order of magnitude below the criterion limit specified for building materials in the literature.

TI Land-use management using a soil survey geographic database for Finney
   County, Kansas
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; GIS; FOREWORD
AB The determination of best management practices for land resources is often complicated by the lack of a means for evaluation and lack of quality data. Soil surveys are an important source of data that can be used to improve farm and ranch planning and environmental protection. In this study, we examined the use of a soil survey geographic (SSURGO) database within a geographic information system (GIS) coupled with remote sensing data for land-use management in Finney County, Kansas. The objectives were (i) to identify landuse change; (ii) to evaluate the influence of soil, groundwater, and physiography on land use; and (iii) to assess land-use potential and present management alternatives. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for 1987, 1989, and 1992 were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. These LULC layers were manipulated with layers: organic matter content, thickness, and texture of the surface soil horizon; land capability class; aquifer thickness (AT); and physiography. Tire acreage of fallow land decreased and the acreage of grassland increased from 1987 to 1992 because of an increase in the acreage of land used in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Broad cropping patterns (irrigated vs. nonirrigated) did not change significantly between 1987 and 1992 and were related to AT. Some currently cropped areas had high erosion potential, whereas some grasslands had relatively low erosion hazards. These grasslands could be used as alternatives for cropping. The study demonstrates the potential of using SSURGO within a GIS coupled with remote sensing information in planning and management for natural resources.

AB Structural failures in recent earthquakes and hurricanes have exposed the weakness of current design procedures and shown the need for new concepts and methodologies for building performance evaluation and design. A central issue is proper consideration and treatment of the large uncertainty in the loadings and the complex building behavior in the nonlinear range in the evaluation and design process. A reliability-based framework for design is proposed for this purpose. Performance check of the structures is emphasized at two levels corresponding to incipient damage and incipient collapse. Minimum lifecycle cost criteria are proposed to arrive at optimal target reliability for performance-based design under multiple natural hazards. The issue of the structural redundancy under stochastic loads is also addressed. Effects of structural configuration, ductility capacity, 3-D motions, and uncertainty in demand versus capacity are investigated. A uniform-risk redundancy factor is proposed to ensure uniform reliability for structural systems of different degree of redundancy. The inconsistency of the reliability/redundancy factor in current codes is pointed out. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous environmental chemicals possess estrogen-like properties. At elevated doses, natural estrogens and environmental estrogen-like chemicals are known to produce adverse effects on humans and wildlife. sources of potential exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds have to be identified for risk and hazard assessment. Extracts prepared from 16 selected water samples taken in Flemish rivers, effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants and reservoirs for drinking water production were analysed for estrogenic activity with a cellular bioassay. Yeast cells, which are stably transfected with the DNA sequence of hER and which contain expression plasmids with the reporter gene lac-Z, encoding the enzyme beta -galactosidase, were used to measure receptor binding. Flemish rivers showed the highest estrogenic potency, compared to effluents of waste water treatment plants and reservoirs which showed low induction factors (beta -galactosidase production) relative to solvent control conditions. By comparison with a standard curve for 17 beta -estradiol (E2), estrogenic potency in water samples was calculated as E2-equivalents and ranged from below detection limit (similar to 2.75 ng E2/1) up to 81.4 ng/l E2-equivalents. About 7 water samples had more than 10 ng/l E2-equivalents. These elevated levels of EP-equivalents are likely to exert significant adverse effects on reproduction success of wildlife, which should be verified with in vivo studies.

AB Laboratory experiments aimed at allowing estimation of emplacement temperatures of pyroclastic deposits flows using WC ratios of entrained carbonized wood were carried by simulating the thermal conditions in pyroclastic flows. Live wood cuttings of four tree genera (Cryptomeria, Pinus, Quercus and Gonystylus) were implanted in volcanic ash heated in an electric furnace. In one group of experiments, wood samples were inserted into the ash in separate runs at temperatures ranging from 238 to 714 degreesC, and then slowly cooled In a second group, samples were held at temperatures between 241 and 743 degreesC for one, three or five days. WC ratios of the carbonized woods produced were then determined by combustion analysis.
   No systematic differences in H/C ratios were observed between genera at given temperatures. WC ratios from the first group of experiments show a strong correlation with temperature, yielding the equation log T(degreesC) = 2.50 - 0.530 log (WC) where WC ratios are <1.0 and T is >300 degreesC. Similar relations are also shown by the second group, although the equations produced differ with time of maximum heating. The relations between WC ratios and temperature from the experiments were tested by analysis of natural carbonized wood fragments from Holocene pyroclastic flow deposits, coupled with independent emplacement temperature estimation from paleomagnetic blocking temperatures of clasts within the flows. The mio methods produced comparable results, suggesting that the WC thermometer is a simple and reliable method for estimating maximum emplacement temperatures of pyroclastic flows. Cooling rates can also be approximated when combined with paleomagnetic studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the main concerns of conservators and curators is to find a method for evaluating the damage incurred by works of art in major galleries, historic houses, and castles with differing indoor environmental conditions. For this purpose, test tempera paintings were prepared and exposed at selected sites. The test paintings act as dosimeters and integrate the contributions from a range of factors which determine the overall environmental hazard to which paintings are exposed. Subsequent analysis of the test paintings involved an interdisciplinary approach using mass spectrometry (FOM Institute, the Netherlands), thermal analysis (Birkbeck College, UK) and non-invasive spectroscopic analysis (CNR-IROE, Italy). These techniques gave a measure of the physicochemical change and hence the resulting damage. In this paper, the thermoanalytical data will be presented, in particular of smalt tempera. Prior accelerated ageing of similar test paintings using controlled conditions was also performed to provide a comparison between artificial and natural ageing and a means for calibrating the test paintings.

AB Objective: To investigate the risk of hepatotoxicity after initiation of protease inhibitor-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV-I infected patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection.
   Design: Retrospective study with 394 HIV-1 infected patients initiating HAART at a single university clinic.
   Methods: Liver enzyme elevation (LEE) was defined as alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase at least five times the upper limit of normal and an absolute increase of > 100 U/I. Relative risks for time to LEE were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: Of 394 patients 7% were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 14% were anti-HCV-positive. Patients with chronic hepatitis had a higher risk for LEE compared with patients without co-infection: 37% versus 12% respectively. After adjustment for higher baseline transaminases, the presence of HBsAgor anti-HCV remained associated with an increased risk of LEE - relative risk 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.50-5.16) and 2.46 (95% confidence interval, 2.43-4.24) respectively, in patients with LEE, transaminases declined whether HAART was continued or modified. Of patients with chronic HBV infection 38% lost HBeAg or developed anti-HBe after initiation of HAART, and one seroconverted from HBsAg-positive to anti-HBs-positive. However, there was no clear relationship with LEE.
   Conclusions: HIV-1-infected patients co-infected with HBV or HCV were at considerably higher risk of developing LEE when HAART was initiated compared with patients without co-infection, but it is usually not necessary to modify antiretroviral therapy. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

ID SOLID-WASTE INCINERATOR
AB The release of heavy metals from MSWI bottom ash has been the key concern in the management of this material. The leaching distribution values obtained from 100 freshly quenched bottom ash samples, according to the German DIN 38414-S4 procedure test, showed the release of lead, zinc and copper to be the main hazards associated with bottom ash utilisation as a secondary building material. Currently, natural weathering of MSWI bottom ash, for an estimated period of 1-3 months, is the most economic treatment available to ensure the eventual utilisation of this material. The leaching of natural weathered bottom ash in the short-term (up to 9 months) was studied. The most significant changes in the bottom ash were found to occur in the first 90 days. At pH values greater than 12, lead, zinc and copper were the main heavy metals to be released from the MSWI freshly quenched bottom ash samples studied. Natural weathering for a period of about 90 days reduced the leaching of heavy metals, stabilising the bottom ash pH to minimise the solubility of metal hydroxides, and enabled the residue to be used as secondary building material. The profile of the pH neutralisation curve is similar to that described by carbonates, which would suggest that the reaction is controlled by CO(2). The formation of insoluble oxides as well as carbonates control the immobilisation of certain heavy metals, e.g. lead and zinc. The leaching of aluminium increases during this short natural weathering stage due to elemental metal oxidation, Aluminium solubility is controlled by the precipitation of gibbsite or other aluminium-sulphate neoformations. The latter may contribute to the immobilisation of heavy metals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the factors, at the time of diagnosis, that determine the prognosis for remission of epilepsy. A prospective community-based cohort study of 792 patients recruited at the time of their first diagnosis of epileptic seizures was undertaken; in those classified 6 months after presentation, the median follow-up period was 7.2 years (quartiles at 6.2 and 8.2 years) after presentation. We analyzed data from 6 months after the first identified seizure, which prompted the dianosis of epilepsy, to allow us to factor in those aspects contingent on a diagnostic assessment. Baseline clinical and demographic data were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with remission of epilepsy for 1, 2, 3, and 5 years as outcome measures. The dominant clinical feature predicting remission was the number of seizures in the 6-month diagnostic assessment period Thus, the chance of entering 1 year of remission by 6 years for a patient who had 2 seizures during this initial 6 months was 95%; for 5 years of remission, it was 47% as opposed to 75% for 1 year of remission and 24% for 5 years of remission if there had been 10 or more seizures during this period, The number of seizures in the early phase of epilepsy there, taken as the first 6 months after presentation) is the single most important predictive factor for both early and long-term remission of seizures.

AB Losses from environmental hazards have escalated in the past decade, prompting a reorientation of emergency management systems away from simple postevent response. There is a noticeable change in policy, with more emphasis on loss reduction through mitigation, preparedness, and recovery programs. Effective mitigation of losses from hazards requires hazard identification, an assessment of all the hazards likely to affect a given place, and risk-reduction measures that are com patible across a multitude of hazards. The degree to which populations are vulnerable to hazards, however, is not solely dependent upon proximity to the source of the threat or the physical nature of the hazard-social factors also play a significant role in determining vulnerability. This paper presents a method for assessing vulnerability in spatial terms using both biophysical and social indicators. A geographic information system was utilized to establish areas of vulnerability based upon twelve environmental threats and eight social characteristics for our study area, Georgetown County, South Carolina. Our results suggest that the most biophysically vulnerable places do not always spatially intersect with the most vulnerable populations. This is an important finding because it reflects the likely "social costs" of hazards on the region. While economic losses might be large in areas of high biophysical risk, the resident population also may have greater safety nets (insurance, additional financial resources) to absorb and recover from the loss quickly. Conversely, it would take only a moderate hazard event to disrupt the well-being of the majority of county residents (who are more socially vulnerable, but perhaps do not reside in the highest areas of biophysical risks) and retard their longer-term recovery from disasters. This paper advances our theoretical and conceptual understanding of the spatial dimensions of vulnerability It further highlights the merger of conceptualizations of human environment relationships with geographical techniques in understanding contemporary public policy issues.

AB This paper develops a theoretical perspective on institutional adaptation to social vulnerability to environmental risks. Institutions encompass both socialized ways of interacting and underlying worldviews, as well as structures and organizations that influence resource allocation The adaptation of institutions that mediate vulnerability to environmental change can be observed by examining actual resource allocations and the processes of decisionmaking and nondecisionmaking, as well as by examining changing perceptions of vulnerability. Institutional adaptation is evaluated in Nam Dinh Province in northern Vietnam, a country presently undergoing rapid economic and political transition. The case study highlights local-level institutional adaptation to environmental risks associated with flooding and typhoon impacts in the coastal environment. It is carried out through fieldwork involving qualitative household survey is and interviewing to elicit present and recent coping and adaptation strategies in the context of rapid changes in property rights and economic circumstances. Although Vietnam's transition from state central planning is often heralded as a macroeconomic success story, this study argues that the transition has had negative impacts on social Vulnerability. A decrease in collective action for risk management by state institutions is exacerbated by inertia in some aspects of the decentralized state planning system, while the parallel spontaneous reemergence of civil institutions forms a counterbalancing institutional adaptation.

DE Canadian fruit-growing industry; climatic and economic hazards
AB The paper gives a comparative and historical assessment of climatic and economic hazards in the five main fruit-growing areas of Canada, and how the industry has responded. The northern location of fruit growing in Canada poses a number of climatic hazards. The most serious hazard is winter low-temperature injury to trees and vines, which results in a capital loss and crop loss for up to five years. The industry has responded to this hazard by abandoning fruit growing in areas with unfavourable climatic conditions and concentrating in areas with the most favourable climatic conditions. Other responses include changing to hardier varieties, improving management practices, and government subsidies. The fruit-growing industry has also had to face many economic hazards, including changes in technology and consumer preferences, changes in international trade rules, increased foreign competition, a cost-price squeeze, and urbanization of the industry's land base. These economic hazards area a greater threat to the industry than the natural hazards because, in most cases, there are limited coping mechanisms available to growers, and economic globalization is preventing the federal and provincial governments from providing an adequate safety net.

DE floodplain management; Canada; Flood Damage Reduction Program
ID ONTARIO
AB Flooding is an important natural process. It plays a Vital role in the maintenance of floodplain and shoreline ecosystems. Yet, it also is a hazard, in that floods put human life and property at risk. Paradoxically, flooding is a hazard only because humans have chosen to occupy flood-vulnerable areas, such as riverine floodplains and lake or coastal shorelines. Recent major floods in Canada are a reminder that vulnerability to floods remains high. Responses to the flooding "problem" have evolved in Canada from an emphasis on controlling "water out of place" through structural measures such as dams and dikes, to managing human behaviour using zoning to keep development away from hazardous areas. In Canada, the federal-provincial Flood Damage Reduction Program, initiated in 1975, has been an important vehicle for delivering a consistent, national approach to floodplain management. However, as of early 1999, the federal government has allowed the program to wind down while it reconsiders its role in water management - effectively leaving the field of flood damage reduction to the provinces. This creates both challenges and opportunities. The challenge will be to avoid a return to the spiral of increasing flood damages and disaster assistance payments that characterized the period up to 1975. At the same time, however opportunities exist to fake stock of floodplain management, and to evaluate alternative future directions, including a move integrated approach to flooding.

AB Background, Although band ligation is now recommended for prevention of rebleeding from oesophageal varices in cirrhosis, sclerotherapy is still widely used. Patients submitted to chronic sclerotherapy undergo several endoscopies and experience a large number of serious complications. However long-term outcome Is poorly defined.
   Aims, To assess the clinical course and prognostic indicators of patients undergoing chronic sclerotherapy for prevention of variceal rebleed as a basis for future evaluation of long-term band ligation outcome.
   Methods, Prospective cohort study prognostic analysis by the Cox proportional hazards model.
   Results. A total of 218 consecutive cirrhotic patients (37 Child class A, 154 B, 27 C) were enrolled in the study. Varices were obliterated in 139 (64%) patients in a mean of 5 (+/-2.6) sessions and recurred in 58/139 (41.7 %) within one year. A total of 139 (60%) patients experienced 283 rebleeding episodes and 73 (33%) died. Bleeding from oesophageal ulcers was the most serious complication causing 14% of all rebleeding episodes. Significant prognostic indicators of sclerotherapy outcome were: Child-Pugh class for variceal obliteration; gastric varices and platelet count for recurrence of varices; failure to obliterate varices, variceal size and gastric varices for rebleeding; blood urea nitrogen and failure to obliterate varices for death. Presence of gastric varices was the only prognostic indicator for death in the 79 patients not achieving variceal obliteration. A mean of 10 endoscopies and of 6 hospital admissions were needed per each patient with an estimated cost of US$ 7154 per patient during the first two years of therapy.
   Conclusions, Sclerotherapy is a very demanding and costly treatment, and is associated with fi frequent and serious side-effects. The probability of treatment failure is significantly higher in Child C patients with gastric varices. Alternative treatments should be considered for these patients.

AB If causes of population fluctuation vary temporally, then tests that search for density dependence in long time series cannot distinguish, at any given time, how much population change is due to density-dependent or density-independent factors. For some species' dynamics, however, it is possible to determine over a restricted period whether density-dependent factors are involved in reducing population densities. I use a new Return Trajectory Likelihood Ratio Test (RTLRT) to determine whether a population perturbed to high density (e.g., by periodic recruitment) exhibits density dependence by returning to a positive asymptote (or leveling density, L) or is density independent and, through proportional hazards, approaches zero exponentially.
   In a series of simulations, declines after recruitment were mimicked by creating sequences that changed due to a combination of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Until the sequence dropped below L, losses due to each mortality type were combined; after that point the density-dependent component was discontinued. The power of the test was assessed over a range of decline rates (e(-b), where b = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1) to zero and to L, initial density values (2, 4, and 6 times higher than L), and observation and process errors (e(sigma) where sigma = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5). Test size was assessed by generating trajectories with no density-dependent decline.
   These simulations identified four critical parameters that influence the likelihood of detecting density-dependent decline. (1) Detection rates change with the ratio of initial recruitment peak to leveling density: high peaks generally increase detection, although they may decrease detection of slow density-dependent declines. (2) High rates of density-dependent decline relative to density-independent decline also improve detection, except that populations rapidly dropping below L will appear density independent regardless of dynamics governing change prior to that time. (3) Error reduces detection of density dependence, except when declines are shallow and process error is assumed. (4) Slow rates of density-independent decline (to <10% of original value) cause the RTLRT to detect density dependence when it is not present (i.e., size is excessive for slow declines).
   As an example of how the RTLRT may be used, I apply it to four years of monthly counts of an intertidal isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, which recruits annually to high densities under boulders. Based on the RTLRT, subsequent declines were density dependent in some years, although detection differed with the assumption of process or observation error, and with the use of separate or averaged samples. In addition to density dependence, selective mortality of one class of individuals or mortality balanced by continuing low immigration could also cause steep declines to L. For isopods, however, densities were higher under boulders with small depressions than under smooth controls, suggesting that declines may occur when densities exceed the number of safe sites available. The postrecruitment decline of I. wosnesenskii appears to be at least partially density dependent.

AB Chemokine receptors (CCR5, CXCR4 and CCR2) have been shown to be important co-receptors for HIV infection. Mutations at CCR5 (CCR5-Delta 32), CCR2 (CCR2-641), and stromal-derived factor SDF1 (SDF1-3'A), a primary ligand for CXCR4, are known to have protective effects against HIV-1 infection and the onset of AIDS symptoms. We studied the three-locus genotype frequency distributions in 70 worldwide populations from a sample of 2341 individuals without any known history of HIV-1 infection and AIDS symptoms. From these data, we estimated the risk of AIDS onset (relative hazard, RH) of each population. This survey shows that the substantial allele frequency differences of each of these mutations translate into an extensive variation in relative hazards for AIDS in worldwide populations. However, no evidence of natural selection against the mutant gene carriers is detected. Finally, the combined three-locus genotype data predict the highest relative hazard (RH) in South-East Asia and Africa where AIDS is known to be more prevalent.

AB Aim-This study describes the long term follow up of haemophilic patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) between 1961 and 1985.
   Methods-Clinical and treatment records from 310 patients with inherited coagulation disorders treated with blood product before 1985 were reviewed. Standard survival analysis methods were used to model progression to liver failure and death.
   Results-A total of 298/305 (98%) patients tested were anti-HCV positive. Twenty seven (9%) individuals consistently HCV polymerise chain reaction negative were considered to have cleared the virus. By 1 September 1999, 223/310 (72%) were alive, 26 (8%) had died a liver related death, and 61 (20%) had died from other, predominantly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related, causes. Kaplan-Meier progression rates to death from any cause and liver related deaths 25 years after exposure to HCV were 47% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 34-60) and 19% (95% CI 10-27), respectively. After 13.3 years from 1985, by which time all patients had seroconverted to HIV, progression rates to death from any cause and liver related deaths were, respectively, 8% (95% CI 4-13) and 3% (95% CI 0.4-6) for those HIV negative, and 57% (95% CI 48-66) and 21% (95% CI 13-31) for those HIV positive (p=0.0001). Using Cox proportional hazard models, the adjusted relative hazard of death for individuals coinfected with HIV compared with those infected with HCV alone was 19.47 (95% CI 9.22-41.10), 0.99 (95% CI 0.39-2.53), 3.47 (95% CI 1.40-8.63), and 9.74 (95% CI 3.91-24.26) for the age groups at infection 10-19 years, 20-29 years, and >30 years, respectively, compared with the age group <10 years. The adjusted relative hazard for genotype 1 compared with other genotypes was 2.7 (95% CI 1.36-5.15).
   Conclusions-While 25 year follow up of 310 haemophilic patients has shown the potentially lethal combination of HIV and HCV coinfection, HCV singly infected individuals show slow progression of liver disease.

DE sharecropping tenancy; moral hazard; risk taking; limited liability
AB We analyze optimal contract choice in agriculture when there is joint moral hazard on the part of the farmer in the supply of effort and the riskiness of the technique of cultivation. In the presence of limited liability, high-powered incentive: contracts such as fixed rental contracts will induce the farmer to adopt techniques of cultivation that are too risky from the point of view of the landlord. On the other hand, low-powered incentive contracts such as fixed wage contracts will induce the farmer to supply too little effort. We show that sharecropping contracts emerge as a natural solution to balance these two conflicting considerations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent experience suggests that the bulk of modem studies of seismic hazard have sought to express ground motion in terms of physical parameters such as peak ground acceleration, spectral acceleration, and so on. The correlation of physical ground motion parameters with actual levels of damage has proved a difficult subject of study. No single ground motion parameter (such as peak ground acceleration) provides an ideal analogue of damage. However, the problems can be bypassed by using earthquake intensity in place of physical ground motion parameters. Intensity relates specifically to damage in a way that parameters like peak ground acceleration do not. The passage from hazard to risk is still problematic using older intensity scales, but since the MSK and the EMS-98 (European Macroseismic Scale) intensity scales directly express the probabilistic nature of damage distributions for any intensity degree, the task is greatly simplified. An equation that expresses the attenuation of EMS intensities is a description of the extent to which damage patterns to different building types vary as a function of magnitude and distance. Such an equation is based directly on past observations of damage, and so it is only natural to expect it to do a reasonable job of predicting future levels of damage. Risk curves can be prepared that show the probability of different grades of damage being suffered by buildings of different types. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PARAMETRIC-HISTORIC PROCEDURE; EARTHQUAKES; AFTERSHOCKS
AB Probabilistic seismic hazard maps are constructed by utilising a new methodology called the parametric-historic method, since it combines the best features of the 'deductive' (Cornell CA. Engineering seismic risk analysis. Bull Seism Soc Am 1968;58;1583-606) and 'historic' (Veneziano D, Cornell CA, O'Hara T. Historic method for seismic hazard analysis. Elect Power Res Inst, Report NP-3438, Pale Alto, 1984) procedures.
   The technique has been developed specifically for the estimation of seismic hazard at individual sites without the subjective judgment involved in the definition of seismic source zones, when specific active faults have not been mapped or identified, and when the causes of seismicity are not well understood. The combination of historical and instrumental data is permitted. The historical part of the catalogue contains only the strongest events, whereas the complete part can be divided into several subcatalogues, each assumed complete above a specified threshold of magnitude. Uncertainty in the determination of magnitude has also been taken into account. The maximum credible magnitude, m(max), is of paramount importance in this approach.
   The seismic hazard maps are based on a long-term earthquake history (599-1997) compiled of the catalogues of Utsu (Utsu T. Catalog of large earthquakes in the region of Japan from 1885 through 1980. Bull Earthq Res Inst, Univ Tokyo, 1982;57:401-63), Usami (Usami T. Materials for comprehensive list of destructive earthquakes in Japan. Tokyo: Tokyo Press, 1996) and JMA for the Japanese islands. The analysis is based on subregions at a grid size of 0.05 degrees along the Japanese islands, for each of which peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations for natural frequencies of 1, 3, 5 and 10 Hz, are predicted and mapped to occur at a 10% probability in 50 years.

AB An investigation was carried out using 25 natural water samples from Narayanganj district, Bangladesh to examine the quality of both groundwater and surface water in relation to pollution and the suitability of these waters for irrigation. High concentrations of Na, Ca, Mg, HCO,, and CI ions were recorded in all the tested samples. Significant variations in the values of electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and major ions were observed. Some samples contained high levels of EC (0.184 to 1.624 dS m(-1) at 25 degreesC) that revealed the presence of soluble salts which could cause crust formation and seal development of the soil profile due to the chemical and mechanical action of test water, and reduce infiltration rate. The average concentrations of Ca and Mg were 78.15 and 16.55 mg L-1. Higher amounts of Ca and Mg ions contributed to the water hardness in some samples. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and the amount of residual sodium carbonate (RSC) ranged from 0.14 to 4.09 and -7.62 to 0.11 meg L-1, respectively, values within the safety limit. Soluble sodium percentage (SSP) ranging from 6.31 to 64.46, graded as excellent to doubtful. The latter category might joe unsuitable for crop production and irrigation. The most serious hazard was represented by the contamination with highly soluble Na that could cause a salinity problem in the soil environment and decrease crop yields.

AB Objective: A study was conducted to define the natural history and disease progression of HIV infection in a developing country.
   Design: A prospective longitudinal cohort study.
   Methods: Forty-two patients with documented dares of HIV seroconversion were followed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Patients were seen at 3 month intervals or when ill. Patients were treated for bacterial, mycobacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections, but antiretroviral therapy was not available. Patients were followed until death or until 1 January 2000; median follow-up was 66 months.
   Results: By Kaplan-Meier analyses, the median time to symptomatic HIV disease (CDC category B or C) was 3.0 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-5.0 years]. The median time to AIDS (CDC category C) was 5.2 years (95% CI 4.7-6.5 years), and the median time to death was 7.4 years (95% CI 6.2-10.2 years). Community-acquired infections, including respiratory tract infections, acute diarrhea, and skin infections were common in the pre-AIDS period. AIDS-defining illnesses included tuberculosis, wasting syndrome, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, candida esophagitis, toxoplasmosis, and cryptococcal meningitis. Rapid progression to death was associated with anemia at the time of seroconversion hazards ratio (HR) 4.1 (95% CI 1.1-15.0), age greater than 35 years at seroconversion HR 4.4 (95% CI 1.1-16.6), and lymphopenia at seroconversion HR 11.0 (95% CI 2.3-53.0).
   Conclusion: This report documents rapid disease progression from HIV seroconversion until death among patients living in a developing country. Interventions, including nutritional support and prophylaxis of common community-acquired infections during the pre-AIDS period may slow disease progression and prolong life for HIV-infected individuals in less-developed countries, (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Background: Today, heavy drinking is a common health hazard among women. The evidence in favor of providing some kind of brief intervention to reduce drinking is quite convincing. However, we do not know if intervention works in a natural environment of routine health care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of long-lasting, brief alcohol intervention counseling for women in a routine general practice setting.
   Methods: In five primary care outpatient clinics in a Finnish town, 118 female early-phase heavy drinkers who consulted their general practitioners for various reasons were given brief alcohol intervention counseling. Intervention groups A (n = 40) and B (n = 38) were offered seven and three brief intervention sessions, respectively, over a 3-yr period. The control group C (n = 40) was advised to reduce drinking at baseline. Main outcome measures were self-reported weekly alcohol consumption, carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase.
   Results: Depending on the outcome measure and the study group, clinically meaningful reduction of drinking was found in 27% to 75% of the heavy drinkers. Within all the groups, MCV significantly decreased. However, there were no statistically significant differences between study groups A, B, and C in the mean changes between the beginning and endpoint in the main outcome measures.
   Conclusions: The present study indicated that minimal advice, as offered to group C, was associated with reduced drinking as much as the brief intervention, as offered to groups A and B, given over a 3-yr period. Furthermore, in the routine setting of the general practice office, the effectiveness of the brief intervention may not be as good as in special research conditions. The factors possibly reducing the effectiveness in a routine setting are unknown. Thus, different methods of implementing brief intervention need to be evaluated to find better ways to support general practice personnel in their efforts to help heavy-drinking female patients to reduce their drinking.

AB Background The onset of symptoms is crucial in the natural history of severe aortic stenosis. In contrast, the impact of the degree of valve obstruction and left ventricular dysfunction on clinical outcome in terms of progression of symptoms and mortality is undefined.
   Methods and Results Between April 1989 and June 1996, 108 patients (75% male, aged 68.7 +/- 10.3 years) with pure and isolated aortic stenosis of at least moderate degree had a complete Doppler echocardiography. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, thickness of ventricular septum, mass and election fraction, and maxima[ instantaneous aortic gradient were measured. Patients were followed up through March 1999. Sixty-five patients who underwent aortic valve replacement were censored at the time of surgery. The end point was considered to be death or symptomatic progression (onset of new symptoms or worsening of symptoms). At the time of diagnosis 64 (59%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-Il and 44 (41%) in NYHA class Ill-IV. After a mean follow-up of 46 +/- 21 months 6 patients died and 45 had worsening of symptoms. Univariate predictors of clinical outcome (death and worsening of symptoms) included left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio 1.03, P = .08), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (HR 1.04, P = .012), and left ventricular septum thickness (HR 1.14, P = .009) but not the degree of aortic obstruction. Multivariate predictors of clinical outcome were left ventricular septum thickness (P = .016) and left ventricular end-systolic diameter (P = .008).
   Conclusion In patients with various degrees of aortic stenosis the rate of clinical outcome is predicted by left ventricular function and septum thickness. Therefore both the left ventricular and aortic valve gradients should be taken into account when choosing the timing of intervention.

AB A prospective study was conducted in Takayama, Gifu, Japan, to evaluate the association between diet and the onset of menopause. A total of 1,130 female residents aged 35-54 years who were premenopausal and completed a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1992 were contacted by mail with a follow-up questionnaire in 1998 to update information on menopause. Onset of menopause was defined as a woman's age at the last menstrual period prior to stopping menstruation for 12 months. During the 6-year study period, 296 women experienced natural menopause. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios of the onset of menopause after controlling for age, total energy, body mass index, years of smoking, and age at which regular menstrual cycle began. The authors found that green and yellow vegetable intake was significantly inversely associated with the 6-year incidence of menopause (hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval: 0.54, 0.95 for the highest vs. lowest tertile of intake, p for trend = 0.02). Association of carotene intake with the incidence of menopause was of borderline significance (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 1.04, p for trend = 0.07).

AB A database of landslides that occurred in Italy between 1279 and 1999 and caused deaths, missing people, injuries and homelessness was compiled from a variety of different sources. These included the archive of the National Research Council's AVI (Damaged Urban Areas) project, which compiled information on landslide events in the 20th century in Italy. The sources also included reports on historical landslide investigations for the whole of Italy, Alpine areas, the Apennines, various regions or provinces, and for single sites. Analysis of the database indicates that more than 10,000 people died in a total of 840 landslide events. Fatal landslide events were more frequent in the Alpine regions of Northern Italy and in Campania (southern Italy), and most casualties occurred in the Autumn. Fast-moving landslides caused the largest number of deaths. They included rockfalls, rockslides, rock avalanches and debris flows. The cumulative frequency of landslide events was plotted against their consequences, and the plots were compared to similar curves for the whole Alps and for Canada, Japan, China and Hong Kong. The frequency in Italy was found to be higher than in the Alps, Canada and I-long Kong, but lower than that of Japan and China. Landslide mortality rates were estimated and compared to mortality rates for other natural, medical, and human-induced hazards. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High sensitivity and distinct degradation characterize the eco-geo-environment in the agropastoral interlocking zone in northern China. Because of its specific natural conditions and human activities, this zone is easy to change and transfer between typical agricultural and pastoral environments. Several kinds of eco-geo-environmental hazards exist in the zone, such as land desertification, climatic disasters, endemic disasters, etc. The mechanisms of these eco-geo-environmental hazards include geotectonic processes in the Earth's history, and exogenic causes, such as the East Asia monsoon and irrational human activities. Both tectonic processes and exogenic causes act on the ecologically vulnerable environment, which makes the potential eco-geo-environmental vulnerabilities real hazards.

TI Searching for small debris in the geostationary ring - Discoveries with
   the Zeiss 1-metre telescope
SO ESA BULLETIN-EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY
LA English
DT Article
AB More than 800 satellites and rocket upper stages have been inserted into the geostationary ring or its vicinity over the years, but only about 250 to 270 of these satellites are currently being used operationally. Geostationary satellites are therefore increasingly at risk of colliding with uncontrolled objects. Contrary to the situation with satellites at very low altitude, there are no effective natural removal mechanisms for objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Ground-based radars and optical telescopes belonging to the United States' Space Surveillance Network (SSN) are able routinely to detect objects larger than 1 m across in GEO. ESA has recently upgraded a telescope at the Teide Observatory in Tenerife (E) with an optimised debris-detection system. Its early observations show a hitherto unknown but significant population of uncatalogued objects with diameters as small as 10 cm in the geostationary ring. Objects smaller than 10 cm are also expected to exist, but these are unobservable even with the 1 m Teide telescope. Further observations are urgently needed to determine the extent and origin of this debris population, and the resulting hazard to operational spacecraft.

AB This study concerns the assessment of the long-term hazards associated both with fission and future fusion reactors, namely:
   intrusion in a fusion waste disposal site. This analysis was performed in the frame of the SEAFP-2 studies of the European Fusion Technology Programme.
   intrusion in a fusion waste disposal site. In this case, data are taken from typical European waste disposal sites.
   long-term migration of radioactive nuclides due to natural waste package degradation, for both fission and fusion reactor cases.
   In all relevant cases, evaluation of associated risks is carried out. A comparison of the obtained results permits to state that:
   intrusion is by far the most relevant source of public risk for radioactive waste disposal;
   fusion shows lower values of radiological hazard compared to that of fission;
   the evaluated risks are well below the acceptable risk limits and in good agreement with the results of other studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Natural history of early gastric cancer: a non-concurrent, long term,
   follow up study
SO GUT
LA English
DT Article
DE early gastric cancer; natural history
AB Background-Controversy has arisen on the natural history of early gastric cancer (EGC). While some emphasise the effectiveness of early detection in reducing mortality from gastric cancer, others insist that EGC is a pseudo-cancer.
   Aims/patients/methods-To elucidate the natural history of EGG, a non-concurrent, long term, follow up study was conducted in 71 patients who were diagnosed endoscopically as having EGG, which was confirmed as cancer on biopsy, but in whom surgical resection was not conducted or delayed by more than six months.
   Results-The natural course of EGC was observed in 56 cases. Over a period of 6-137 months, 20 remained in the early stage while 36 progressed to the advanced stage. The proportion remaining in the early stage consistently decreased with time. Median duration of those who remained in the early stage was estimated as 44 months. The cumulative five year risk for progressing to the advanced stage was 63.0%. In 38 cases there was no evidence for undergoing surgical resection for gastric cancer. The cumulative five year corrected survival was estimated as 62.8% among those unresected. Hazard rate ratio for gastric cancer mortality was 0.65 (p=0.34) for screening detected versus non-screening detected. Hazard rate ratio for gastric cancer mortality was 0.51, significantly lower for patients whose operations were delayed compared with those unresected.
   Conclusions-Although EGC showed a relatively long natural history in general, it progressed to the advanced stage with time and led to death from gastric cancer for the most part if left untreated.

AB Objectives: To evaluate clinical conditions associated with mortality in HIV-infected children with CD4(+) counts <100 cells/<mu>l.
   Methods: The Pediatric Spectrum of HIV Disease Project is a longitudinal medical record review study with eight study sites in the United States, which have been enrolling children since 1989. Survival time from baseline very low CD4 count (<100 cells/<mu>l) to death was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the effect of clinical variables on mortality.
   Results: Of 522 children (greater than or equal to1 year of age) with serial CD4(+) T-lymphocyte measurements, the median age at the first very low CD4 count was 4.8 years. The estimated median survival following the first very low CD4 count was 36 months. The following factors present at the first very low CD4 count were independently associated with a higher risk of death: younger age, weight-for-age >2 standard deviations below the mean, and previously diagnosed AIDS. The subsequent development of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated disease, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) infection, wasting syndrome, or esophageal candidiasis was also independently associated with a higher risk of death.
   Conclusion: Survival in HIV-infected children with very low CD4 counts before introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy was highly variable. Poor nutritional status and the development of CMV disease or MAI infection were associated with the shortest survival times.

AB Issues in the selection and timing of liver transplantation for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) remain controversial. Although the Child-Pugh classification (CP) score and Mayo PSC model have similar abilities to estimate pretransplantation survival, a comparison of these 2 scores in predicting survival after liver transplantation has not been conducted. The aim of this study is to compare the Mayo PSC model and CP score in predicting patient survival and related economic outcomes after liver transplantation. Data from 128 patients with PSC, identified from the NIDDK database, were used to calculate patient-specific Mayo PSC and CP scores before transplantation. Levels reflecting a poor outcome were defined a priori. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and regression methods (Cox proportional hazards and linear regression models) were used to assess the relationship between these 2 scores and 5 post liver transplantation outcome measures. CP score was found to be a significantly (P < .05) better predictor of death 4 months or less after liver transplantation than: (a) length of hospital stay >21 days (or death before discharge) and (b) resource utilization >200,000 units (measured by area under the ROC curve). The Cox model identified statistically significant (P < .05) associations between CP score and each outcome after adjusting for the Mayo PSC risk score. Similar results were not observed for the Mayo PSC model when adjusted for CP score. Among patients with PSC undergoing liver transplantation, CP score was a better overall predictor of both survival and economic resource utilization compared with the Mayo PSC model.

AB Background and Purpose-There is little population-based information on cerebrovascular events and survival among valvular heart disease patients. We used the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and the Cox proportional hazards model to determine rates and predictors of cerebrovascular events and death among valve disease patients.
   Methods-This population-based historical cohort study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, reviewed residents with a first echocardiographic diagnosis of mitral stenosis (n = 19), mitral regurgitation (n = 528), aortic stenosis (n = 140), and aortic regurgitation (n = 106) between 1985 and 1992.
   Results-During 2694 person-years of follow-up, 98 patients developed cerebrovascular events and 356 died. Compared with expected numbers, these observations are significantly elevated, with standardized morbidity ratio of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.6 to 3.8) and 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2 to 2.7), respectively. Independent predictors of cerebrovascular events were age, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis. The risk ratio of severe aortic stenosis was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.4 to 8.6), with atrial fibrillation conferring greater risk at younger age. Predictors of death were age, sex, cerebrovascular events, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure, the greatest risk being among those with both congestive heart failure and cerebrovascular events (risk ratio = 8.8; 95% CI, 5.8 to 13.4). Valve disease type and severity were not independent determinants of death.
   Conclusions-The risk of cerebrovascular events and death among patients with valve disease remains high. Age, atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis are independent predictors of cerebrovascular events, and age, sex, cerebrovascular events, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease are independent predictors of death in these patients.

TI A Hazard Quotient approach for assessing the risk to non-target
   arthropods from plant protection products under 91/414/EEC: hazard
   quotient trigger value proposal and validation
SO ANZEIGER FUR SCHADLINGSKUNDE-JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The EU Plant Protection Product Directive 91/414/EEC recommends the EPPO/CoE Arthropod Natural Enemies Risk Assessment Scheme for guidance on how to conduct risk assessments for terrestrial non-target arthropods. This scheme is currently in the process of being revised by EPPO/CoE. A major change will be the recommendation for the generation and use of 'Dose Response' toxicity data instead of limit test data. In addition, the revised EPPO/CoE Nontarget Arthropods Risk Assessment Scheme will replace the current arbitrary 30% threshold trigger value applied to limit test data, with a Hazard Quotient (HQ; = Ratio Application Rate/LC50 on Glass)), comparable to the successful approach adopted in the EPPO/CoE 'Honeybee Risk Assessment Scheme'. However, in order for this new approach to be implemented under 91/414/EEC, an appropriate regulatory HQ trigger value needs to be derived, Such an HQ trigger value has been established by calculating HQ values for the 2 recommended sensitive indicator species (T: pyri and Aphidius) for a wide range of products and validating opposite robust semi-field/field data. This validation indicated that an HQ trigger value of greater than or equal to 12 for T. pyri and greater than or equal to 8 for Aphidius spp., should be used to trigger higher-tier risk assessment and/or higher-tier testing for non-target arthropods. As these trigger values were validated with realistic semi-field/field data they apply for both lethal and sub-lethal effects as well as single and multiple application scenarios. Due to the worst case assumptions used in this HQ validation analysis, no further uncertainty factors need to be applied for in-crop risk assessment. Whilst a small amount of uncertainty exists regarding the comparative sensitivity of T. pyri and Aphidius spp. for off-crop non-target arthropod guilds of arthropods, this is balanced by the fact that the off-crop exposure assessment used in the HQ derivation, is at least an order of magnitude higher than that realistically likely in the field. This HQ approach and trigger value is an appropriate and conservative tool for tier 1 risk assessment, which should reduce the number of false positive results leading to unnecessary higher-tier testing.

ID AZADIRACHTIN; FORMULATION; MESOCOSM; PRODUCTS
AB Microcosm trials were conducted with the botanical insecticide Margosan-O(R) to assess the potential hazards of the product to aquatic organisms. Laboratory chronic bioassays with water from the treated microcosms were conducted to provide an estimate of the residual effect of Margosan-O. Results from chronic tests showed Margosan-O toxicity to be greater in the laboratory exposures than in situ with Culicidae larvae exposed to the same concentrations. Residue analyses of the active ingredient, azadirachtin, determined that it had a half-life of 36 to 48 h in water exposed to natural sunlight. Two applications of Margosan-O at the recommended application rate for pests did not harm aquatic invertebrates that are categorized as planktonic and filter feeding (Culex sp. and Daphnia sp.). However, the benthic invertebrate (Chironomus riparius) was affected by multiple applications of neem. These results show that the use of Margosan-O and possibly other neem extracts in or near aquatic environments could lead to disturbances in benthic populations and may cause decreases in numbers of organisms that are important in food web and nutrient cycling processes.

TI Kinetics of vanadium bioaccumulation by the brackish water hydroid
   Cordylophora caspia (Pallas)
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ASCIDIANS
AB Vanadium is an abundant metal, which enters the environment via natural rock leaching. A large fraction however, enters the environment through the combustion of coal or petroleum products, which can contain high vanadium concentrations of biological origin. In steel industry vanadium is used as an alloy, therefore, the residual slag stones of steel production can contain rather high concentrations of this heavy metal. Since slag stones are increasingly used in riverbank reinforcement and since it is known that vanadium can leach from these artificial stones into the aquatic environment current interest arose on the toxicity of vanadium towards aquatic organisms. Vanadium, inhaled by humans as vanadium pentoxid, accumulates mainly in hair, liver. kidney and bones (Nechay et al. 1986) and causes several health hazards (for review see: Philipps et al. 1983). For the aquatic environment, very little is known about accumulation in biota and about toxic effects arising in invertebrates. Apart from studies with several ascidian species, which are known to accumulate vanadium from sea water up to the 10(6)-fold (Michibata et al. 1989) sparse information exists on accumulation of vanadium by invertebrates. Ringelband & Karbe (1996) showed that vanadium inhibits the colonial growth of hydroids, and that it acts as a potent inhibitor of hydroidal Na-K-ATPase. Up to now, very little is known about the biokinetic behaviour of vanadium in hydroids. The aim of the present study is to determine accumulation kinetics of vanadium in the brackish water polyp Cordylophora caspia.
   Cordylophora caspia is a colonial polyp (fam.: Clavidae) with optimal population growth in brackish water with salinity ranging between 10 and 16 parts per thousand (Kinne 1956). Hydroids are particularly sensitive to heavy metals and they serve as test organisms in a well-established population growth test (Stebbing. 1976, Karbe et al. 1984).

AB To assess the potential selection pressure caused by intraguild predation between predators and parasitoids of aphids an estimate was made of the predation risk to Aphis fabae Scop. mummified by Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall, 1896) on sugar beet. Mummified aphids were exposed to a natural community of predators. Their survival time was estimated during a 10-day field survey. Additionally, the role of alternative prey on parasitoid survival was investigated by adding unparasitised aphids to half of the mummy aggregations.
   The field data were evaluated by survival analysis. Two covariates were tested within a Cox proportional hazard model: (i) the presence of the alternative prey and (ii) the patch structure (number of proximal mummies attacked). Within 4-5 days after exposure predators destroyed approx. 50% of the mummies. The model with both covariates revealed a significant difference concerning survival of the mummies in the two treatments (Likelihood ratio test, chi(2) = 78.03, P = 0.0001). Alternative prey reduced the predation risk on mummies by 29%, while a high level of predation on proximal mummies increased the individual predation risk by 4%. The results are discussed in the context of prey location by predators and the evolution of anti-predator mechanisms.

AB This prospective randomized study compared human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and micronized transvaginal progesterone for luteal support in 310 in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients treated with leuprolide acetate and gonadotropins in a long protocal, and showing normal ovarian response. Both treatment groups were homogeneous for age, BMI, stimulation treatment and ovarian response. Pregnancy rates per embryo transfer were not significantly different (33.1% for the hCG group versus 38.7% for the progesterone group). For IVF patients with a normal response to stimulation under pituitary supression, the use of hCG or progesterone for luteal support does not seem to have any effect on pregnancy rate. The choice of luteal treatment must balance medical hazard and patient convenience, as both therapeutic regimens seem equally effective.

SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE radionuclides; screening values; ecological risk assessment; water;
   sediment; and fish
AB Radiological benchmarks for aquatic biota were developed for use at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation as screening values to determine the spatial extent of potential ecological effects and to identify the need for additional site-specific investigation. The Point Source Dose Distribution approach was used to calculate water and sediment activities for selected radionuclides that result in a total dose rate to small and large fish of 1 Rad d(-1), which is the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements' recommended acceptable dose rate to natural populations of aquatic biota. These screening values incorporate internal and external exposures from parent isotopes and all short-lived daughter products. They also include exposures from all major alpha, beta, and gamma emissions for each isotope. Unlike exposures to chemicals, exposures to radionuclides are expressed as the dose rate received by the organism. Dose rates that account for the biological effects to the organism are additive. If the total dose rate from all radionuclides and pathways exceeds a recommended acceptable dose rate, further analysis is needed to determine the hazards posed by radionuclides. If, however, the total dose rate falls below an acceptable dose rate, radionuclides may be eliminated from further study.

Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of B. bassiana in healthy and microsporidian-infected colonies showed that fire ants from infected colonies were more susceptible to B. bassiana infection than ants from healthy colonies. The LC50 of B. bassiana in microsporidian-infected workers was 4.5X less than that of healthy colonies. Mortality of ante from T, solenopsae-infected colonies that were treated with 9.66 x 10(6) B. bassiana colony forming units per cm(2) was subadditive compared to either pathogen alone.

AB Coinfection with multiple types of genital human papillomavirus (HPV) has been reported, but how frequently it occurs and whether prior infection with specific HPV types inhibits subsequent infection by related types are not known. To address this, 518 women were followed for an average of 2.9 years, and behavioral information and cervical and vulvovaginal swabs for HPV DNA assay were obtained at 4-month intervals, A polymerase chain reaction-based method was used to detect types frequently found in cervical cancers (HPV 16, 18, 31, and 45) and in genital warts (HPV 6 and 11). Concurrent acquisition of multiple types occurred more often than expected by chance. However, no 2 types were more or less likely to be acquired concurrently than any other 2 types. When considering sequential acquisition of HPV types, we found that risk of acquiring a new HPV type was not decreased among those with Drier infection by a phylogenetically related or unrelated type (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.0 [0.4-3.0] and 1.3 [0.8-2.1], respectively).

TI Risk/risk trade-offs in pesticide regulation: An exploratory analysis of
   the public health effects of a ban on organophosphate and carbamate
   pesticides
SO RISK ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE risk trade-off analysis; pesticides; substitution risk
ID MORTALITY; RISK; COSTS; FOLATE; INCOME
AB Efforts to reduce pesticide-related risks to consumers and farmworkers often neglect the possibility that measures to reduce the target risk may introduce or enhance countervailing risks. These may arise from substitute pesticides or pest-control practices, from increased levels of pests or pest-related hazards, from increased levels of toxic natural pesticides in plants, from increased costs and decreased consumption of health-enhancing fruits and vegetables, or from direct income effects on consumers and farmers. The effect of the countervailing risks may partially or completely offset the reduction in the target risk. A risk-trade-off analysis was conducted of a potential ban on the use of organophosphate and carbamate (OP/Carbamate) insecticides in U.S. agriculture. Although this scenario is extreme, it has the analytic virtue of dispensing with the infinite number of "next-best" OP/Carbamates that might be substituted for specific combinations of crops and pests should only selected uses be banned. The analysis relies on detailed descriptions of the alternative pesticides and pest-control measures that would be used for each of 14 major crops. The effects of pest-control cost changes on prices and consumption and effects on consumer and producer incomes are projected using a general-equilibrium economic model. Several countervailing risks that may be significant were found, including acute toxicity to farmworkers from substitute pesticides, cancer and noncancer risks from substitute pesticides, and mortality induced by changes in disposable income. Other countervailing risks are more difficult to estimate or weigh. Potential increases in natural plant pesticides following an OP/Carbamate ban are discussed but data are lacking to quantify the effects. Changes in diet following the ban have both positive and negative effects, and the ultimate change is difficult to estimate. Although a net risk cannot be estimated, several approaches were illustrated that would be useful in risk-trade-off analyses. Key factors complicating comprehensive analysis of risk/risk trade-offs for pesticides were also identified, including data gaps and shortcomings of current risk assessment methods.

AB Several crystalline and amorphous silica dusts (two quartz of natural origin, one cristobalite of natural and two of biogenic origin, three amorphous diatomite earths and one pyrogenic amorphous silica) were studied in the SHE cell transformation assay, in order to compare their cytotoxic and transforming potencies and examine the role of the structure and of the state of the surface on these effects. Some samples were modified by grinding, etching and heating with the aim of establishing relationships between single surface properties and biological responses. The results showed that some quartz and cristobalite dusts (crystalline) as well as the diatomaceous earths (amorphous), but not the pyrogenic amorphous silica, were cytotoxic and induced morphological transformation of SHE cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The ranking in cytotoxicity was different from that in transforming potency, suggesting two separate molecular mechanisms for the two effects. The cytotoxic and transforming potencies were different from one dust to another. even among the same structural silicas, The type of crystalline structure (quartz vs cristobalite) and the crystalline vs biogenic amorphous form did not correlate with cytotoxic or transforming potency of silica dusts, Comparison of cellular effects induced by original and surface modified samples revealed that several surface functionalities modulate cytotoxic and transforming potencies. The cytotoxic effects appeared to be related to the distribution and abundance of silanol groups and to the presence of trace amounts of iron on the silica surface, Silica particles with fractured surfaces and/or iron-active sites, able to generate reactive oxygen species, induced SHE cell transformation. The results show that the activity of silica at the cellular level is sensitive to the composition and structure of surface functionalities and confirm that the biological response to silica is a surface originated phenomenon.

AB Context Since its licensure in 1995, the extensive use of varicella vaccine and close surveillance of the associated anecdotal reports of suspected adverse effects provide the opportunity to detect potential risks not observed before licensure because of the relatively small sample size and other limitations of clinical trials.
   Objectives To detect potential hazards, including rare events, associated with varicella vaccine, and to assess case reports for clinical and epidemiological implications.
   Design and Setting Postlicensure case-series study of suspected vaccine adverse events reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from March 17, 1995, through July 25, 1998.
   Main Outcome Measures Numbers of reported adverse events, proportions, and reporting rates (reports per 100 000 doses distributed).
   Results VAERS received 6574 case reports of adverse events in recipients of varicella vaccine, a rate of 67.5 reports per 100 000 doses sold. Approximately 4% of reports described serious adverse events, including 14 deaths. The most frequently reported adverse events were rashes, possible vaccine failures, and injection site reactions. Misinterpretation of varicella serology after vaccination appeared to account for 17% of reports of possible vaccine failures. Among 251 patients with herpes tester, 14 had the vaccine strain of varicella tester virus (VZV), while 12 had the wild-type virus. None of 30 anaphylaxis cases was fatal, An immunodeficient patient with pneumonia had the vaccine strain of VZV in a lung biopsy, Pregnant women occasionally received varicella vaccine through confusion with varicella tester immunoglobulin. Although the role of varicella vaccine remained unproven in most serious adverse event reports, there were a few positive rechallenge reports and consistency of many cases with syndromes recognized as complications of natural varicella.
   Conclusion Most of the reported adverse events associated with varicella vaccine are minor, and serious risks appear to be rare. We could not confirm a vaccine etiology for most of the reported serious events; several will require further study to clarify whether varicella vaccine plays a role. Education is needed to ensure appropriate use of varicella serologic assays and to eliminate confusion between varicella vaccine and varicella zoster immunoglobulin.

AB Pesticide pollution of surface waters represents a considerable hazard for the aquatic environment. However, the mean amount of pesticides reaching the water resources vanes considerably between regions and depends highly upon application rates, chemical characteristics of pesticides and natural conditions during application. In this study a model was developed which estimates loss of 42 active ingredients applied to 11 field crops, vineyards and orchards along each non-point source path of entry (subsurface drains, runoff and spray drift). A spatially and temporally differentiated data set of application rates and periods was compiled for each active ingredient and target culture to enable the modeling of pesticide transport. The model results are provided in digital raster format (100 mx 100 m) within a geographic information system (GIS). The calculated pesticide loads in surface waters were compared with measured loads from different catchments in Germany. Both data sets agreed as to the order of magnitude, nevertheless due to the scale of the study the estimated loads cannot be interpreted as absolute values and only differences between active ingredients, regions and application periods should be assessed.

AB Background To assess the immune competence of workers occupationally exposed to lead, several subsets of peripheral lymphocytes, i.e., T TCD4(+), TCD8(+), B, NK cells, serum immunoglobulin and complement protein concentrations, chemotaxis, and intracellular killing activity of neutrophils of 25 male storage battery workers have been analyzed and compared to 25 healthy males with no history of lead exposure.
   Results The results of this study which indicated that industrial exposure to lead resulting in group mean blood lead concentrations of 75 +/- 18 mu g/dl are associated with a significant depression of: T helper lymphocytes, Ig G, Ig M and C3, C4 complement levels, chemotaxis, and random migration of neutrophils. No correlation was found between the duration of exposure and the altered immune parameters.
   Conclusion The immune system can be a target for lead toxicity and elimination of lead hazard in working places is necessary. Am. J. Ind. Med. 38:349-354, 2000. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

DT Article
ID FISSION; FUEL
AB In this study, neutronic effects on (D-T) driven hybrid reactor fuelled with different mixtures of 45.5% fertile fuels, vary from 0 to 100% for uranium components and from 100 to 0% for the thorium component in the fuel mixtures. These mixtures are UF4 + THF4, UO2 + ThO2 UC2 + ThC2. The coolants are selected as flibe (Li2BeF4), natural lithium and air for the heat transfer out of the fuels zones and the clad material is selected as SS-316 stainless steel with a volume fraction ratio of 9%. The fuel zones of the hybrid reactor are investigated to obtain fissile fuel breeding (U-233 and/or Pu-239). A regeneration period of up to 48 months is investigated by a plant factor of 75% under a first wall neutron flux (phi(w)) of 2.2210(14) (14.1 MeV) n/ cm(2).s for a conventional (D,T) driven hybrid reactor. These correspond to a first wall neutron load of 5 MW/m(2). At the end of the operation periods, cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) value varies between 6.7% in pure UF4 with flibe coolant and 3.5% in pure ThO2 with natural lithium coolant. At the beginning of the operation, the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is higher than unity in air coolant and natural lithium coolant cases. In flibe coolant cases the TBR value can reach nearly 55% uranium component + 45% thorium components. Therefore, the hybrid blanket is self-sufficient with respect to the TBR for these cases. It is important to follow the non-prolific level of the plutonium fuel during operation because of the nuclear weapons hazard. Nuclear quality of the plutonium increases linearly during the operation period. Pu-240 content has to be higher than 5% for safety. Pu-240 content is higher than 5% in UF4 + ThF4, UC2, + ThC2 and (UO2 > 20%) + (ThO2 < 80%) with flibe coolant. This is very important criteria for safety. In natural lithium and air coolant cases Pu-240 content is lower than 5%. In these cases, the operation period must be increased for safety. U-233 is used as a fuel in thermal reactors and can be separated from the Thourium component. But this separation is too difficult in the thorium component + uranium component mixtures. Therefore, investigated hybrid blanket is safer than 100% Th component. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is ongoing public concern on potential hazards and risks of even small electromagnetic fields (EMFs) such as those emanating from electrical appliances. Evolution and persistence of life in the natural geofields and basic scientific experience in using technical EMFs (F) suggest that, in general, living matter is remarkably stable against external field perturbations within the technical safety limits of the EM field strengths. Besides the trivial primary effects of EMF on ionic charges and dipolar matter, it is explicitly elaborated that cellular biochemical reactivity and channel transport processes are field dependent. However, equilibrium(K) and rate (k) constants are only sensitive to F if the reaction moments DeltaM are finite, as seen in the general van't Hoff relationship d 1n K/dF = DeltaM/RT. Indeed, it is the difference (DeltaM) in the electric or magnetic moments (M), representing the difference in the field forces on the reaction partners. that determines the extent of the field-induced transitions, say from an inactive conformer of a macromolecule to an active one. If small EM fields, which locally can only cause small shifts in K and k, are to become effective for chemical reactivity, amplification is required. A widely encountered concept of chemical amplification is structural, and thus functional, cooperativity, realized in many biopolymers. The cooperation of n units of such a polymer yields a larger DeltaM(n) = n DeltaM and exponentially increases the field sensitivity of the overall equilibrium constant K(n)= K-n. Using the acetylcholine receptor protein as an example for signal amplification by structural cooperativity, explicit proposals are specified for the presumed amplification of small local field effects on proteins of the classical signal transduction cascades. Electric membrane field amplification by interfacial polarization in external fields is discussed in the context of using electric field pulses to transiently permeabilize cells and tissue for the direct transfer of effector substances and genes in cancer and gene therapy.

AB This paper focuses on the methodology developed for analyzing a multivariate interval-censored data set from an AIDS observational study. A purpose of the study was to determine the natural history of the opportunistic infection cytomeglovirus (CMV) in an HIV-infected individual. For this observational study, laboratory tests were performed at scheduled clinic visits to test for the presence of the Ch IV virus in the blood and in the urine (called CMV shedding in the blood and urine). The study investigators were interested in determining whether the stage of HIV disease at study entry was predictive of an increased risk for CMV shedding in either the blood or the urine. If all patients had made each clinic visit, the data would be multivariate grouped failure time data and published methods could be used. However, many patients missed several visits, and when they returned, their lab tests indicated a change in their blood and/or urine CMV shedding status, resulting in interval-censored failure time data. This paper outlines a method for applying the proportional hazards model to the analysis of multivariate interval-censored failure time data from a study of CMV in HIV-infected patients.

AB The Fas-Fas ligand system is important in apoptosis mediated by CTLs and natural killer cells. The suppression of apoptosis contributes to carcinogenesis, as well as to a resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Circulating soluble Fas (sFas), which is generated by alternative mRNA splicing, can antagonize cell-surface Fas function. We investigated sFas levels in 64 patients with gynecological malignancies (28 cervical carcinomas, 18 endometrial carcinomas, and 18 ovarian carcinomas) and in 24 healthy female donors by using a Fas-specific ELISA, In each carcinoma group, serum sFas demonstrated a statistically significant elevation relative to levels in normal controls (P < 0.0001). Levels of serum sFas in patients with advanced cancer (FIGO stages III and IV) significantly exceeded those in patients with localized cancer (FIGO stages I and II) or those in normal control subjects (P < 0.0001). We divided the patients into two groups based on the level of serum sFas and examined the relationship between serum sFas levels and survival. No deaths occurred in the groups with cervical and endometrial cancer with a serum sFas level <1.5 ng/ml, Survival rates in groups with cervical carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma with a serum sFas level <1.5 ng/ml exceeded those in groups with sFas levels of greater than or equal to 1.5 ng/ml (P < 0.001, P = 0.128, and P = 0.012, respectively). Proportional hazard models demonstrated that serum sFas level was a statistically significant factor (P = 0.0196) for survival, as well as histological grade (P = 0.0168) in ovarian carcinoma.

   law feminism
SO FEMINIST REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE nature; new reproductive and genetic technologies; natural law;
   ecofeminism; Canada; reproduction
AB This article examines the precepts of natural law feminism, and in exploring the writings of two Canadian feminists, Maureen McTeer and Louise Vandelac, examines how natural law feminism is deployed in debates about how to theorize reproduction. I contend that the natural law perspective obscures many issues worthy of feminist inquiry, and, perhaps more critically, eschews a discourse that emphasizes reproductive freedom in favour of one which has at its centre a largely unproblematized view of reproduction that follows a biologically driven script of conception, gestation, childbirth and mothering as inherently and necessarily connected.
   I argue that this stance is particularly evident in natural law feminist analyses of ecology and the regulation of new reproductive and genetic technologies. In both these areas, natural law feminism poses the central problem as one in which feminists must zealously protect the natural association between women and reproduction; in so doing, natural law feminists gloss over the nature of this association. I suggest a reframing of the focus of debates on reproduction from what is natural and what is socially constructed to how we demarcate the two.

AB The presence of trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, neosolaniol and diacetoxyscirpenol) was studied in 50 samples of Argentinean beer (nine different brands). Gas chromatography with electron capture detector was used for identification and quantification of these mycotoxins. The only mycotoxin detected was deoxynivalenol (DON). It was present in 44% of the samples, 18% were contaminated with more than 20 ng/ml. Toxin levels ranged from 4 to 221 ng/ml in positive samples. This is the first report on DON contamination of Argentinean beer. The estimate of probable daily intake (PDI) of DON from beer consumption in Argentina does not indicate a health hazard, but it has to be taken into account in calculations of total DON exposure in the population.

ID CONCEALED FAULTS; TRENCH DATA; USA
AB Gravity and magnetic data were collected in the Mosida Hills, Utah County, Utah, at over 1100 stations covering an area of approximately 58 km(2) (150 mi(2)) in order to help define the subsurface geology and assess potential geological hazards for urban planning in an area where the population is rapidly increasing. In addition, potential hydrocarbon traps and mineral ore bodies may be associated with some of the interpreted subsurface structures. Standard processing techniques were applied to the data to remove known variations unrelated to the geology of the area. The residual data were used to generate gravity and magnetic contour maps, isometric projections, profiles, and subsurface models. Ambiguities in the geological models were reduced by (I) incorporating data from previous geophysical surveys, surface mapping, and aeromagnetic data, (2) integrating the gravity and magnetic data from our survey and (3) correlating the modeled cross sections Gravity highs and coincident magnetic highs delineate mafic lava hows, gravity lows and magnetic highs reflect tuffs, and gravity highs and magnetic lows spatially correlate with carbonates. These correlations help identify the subsurface geology and lead to new insights about the formation of the associated valleys. At least eight new faults (or fault segments) were identified from the gravity data, whereas the magnetic data indicate the existence of at least three concealed and/or poorly exposed igneous bodies, as well as a large ash-flow tuff. The presence of low-angle faults suggests that folding or downwarping, in addition to faulting, played a role in the formation of the valleys in the Mosida Hills area. The interpreted location and nature of concealed faults and volcanic hows in the Mosida Hills area are being used by policy makers to help develop mitigation procedures to protect life and property.

AB In northern Italy, and especially in the Po Valley, instability phenomena such as hail and thunderstorms are mainly associated with the penetration of Atlantic disturbances, especially cold fronts, or prefrontal squall lines in the mid-seasons, and with the thermal convection of hot and moist air in the summer. Changes of their seasonal distribution may be considered as an index of anomalies in the synoptic pressure pattern, which determines the general circulation over Europe. Two different types of meteorological data have been analysed: (1) historical, non-specialist descriptions, taken from chronicles, annals or diaries after ad 1300, when people began to record, in addition to the most outstanding climatic events and natural hazards, minor observations including instability phenomena; (2) regular daily observations made by trained meteorologists after 1740. The historical descriptions show that in the Po Valley the highest thunderstorm frequency is in the summer, between June and August, but in the 1500s the distribution was anomalous. In that century, a broad maximum was found between March and August, and a secondary maximum was found in December. In the early period of observations made by trained meteorological personnel, i.e., 1740-1799, a summer maximum of thunderstorm frequency was found, almost equally distributed from June to August, followed by May and September. In the most recent period, i.e., 1940-1989, the seasonal distribution was very regular for three decades (1940 to 1969) with the mode in June, followed by July and August, and it then changed, with more late peaks. The historical written sources show that the seasonal distribution of hail was more homogeneous than thunderstorms. Hail was especially frequent in the summer, from June to August, except in the 1500s, when the seasonal distribution was practically one month earlier. In the early period of regular meteorological observations, hail was seasonally distributed less regularly than thunderstorms, with more skew and earlier in the year. The maximum frequency was in June, followed by April, May, July and August. In the most recent period, the distribution was still irregular, with marked fluctuations, the distribution being displaced later in the season.

AB Controversy about the value of the post-coital test (PCT) has prompted us to re-analyse data from 207 couples, originally studied between 1982 and 1983, with at least 12 months infertility at presentation, complete diagnostic information and exclusion of female factors, to clarify the effect of duration of infertility on the prediction of conception. In couples with less than 3 years infertility and a positive PCT, 68% conceived within 2 years compared with 17% of those with a negative result. After 3 years, corresponding rates were 14% and 11%, The relative risks of conception [95% confidence interval (CI)] calculated using the Cox's proportional hazards model were 0.23 (0.12-0.43) for a negative PCT (reference positive PCT) and 0.25 (0.13-0.51) for more than 36 months infertility (reference 12-23 months). Semen analysis had no extra predictive power given the duration of infertility and the PCT. The PCT is an effective predictor of conception where defined female causes of infertility are absent and duration of infertility is less than 3 years. Once infertility is prolonged (beyond 3 years) the conception rate is low even with a positive test because a large proportion of couples remaining childless so long have true unexplained infertility. Use of the PCT will enable clinicians to allocate scarce, expensive and invasive resources effectively.

AB In a cohort of 6338 'Califomia Seventh - day Adventists, we previously observed for males associations between long-term concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mum (PM10) and 15-year mortality due to all natural causes (ANC) and lung cancer (LC) listed as underlying causes of death and due to nonmalignant respiratory disease listed as either the underlying or a contributing (CRC) cause of death. The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether these outcomes were more strongly associated with the fine (PM2.5) or the coarse (PM2.5-10) fractions of PM10. For participants who lived near an airport (n = 3769), daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from airport visibility, and on a monthly basis, PM2.5-10 concentrations were calculated as the differences between PM10 and PM2.5. Associations between ANC, CRC, and LC mortality (1977-1992) and mean PM10, PM2.5, and PM2.5-10 concentrations at study baseline ( 1973-1977) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Magnitudes of the PM10 associations for the males of this subgroup were similar to those for the males in the entire cohort although not statistically significant due to the smaller numbers. In single-pollutant models, for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10 (29.5 mug/m(3)), the rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 1.15 (0.94, 1.41) for ANC, 1.48 (0.93, 2.34) for CRC, and 1.84 (0.59, 5.67) for LC. For an IQR increase in PM2.5 (24.3 mug/m(3)), corresponding RRs (95% CI) were 1.22 (0.95, 1.58), 1.64 (0.93, 2.90), and 2.23 (0.56, 8.94), and for an IQR increase in PM2.5-10 (9.7 mug/m(3)), corresponding RRs (95% CI) were 1.05 (0.92, 1.20), 1.19 (0.88, 1.62), and 1.25 (0.63, 2.49), respectively. When both PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 were entered into the same model, the PM2.5 estimates remained stable while those of PM2.5-10 decreased. We concluded that previously observed associations of long-term ambient PM10 concentration with mortality for males were best explained by a relationship of mortality with the fine fraction of PM10 rather than with the coarse fraction of PM10.

AB Object. The authors conducted a study to investigate the long-term natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and the predictive risk factors determining subsequent rupture in a patient population in which surgical selection of cases was not performed.
   Methods. One hundred forty-two patients with 181 unruptured aneurysms were followed from the 1950s until death or the occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or until the years 1997 to 1998. The annual and cumulative incidence of aneurysm rupture as well as several potential risk factors predictive of rupture were studied using life-table analyses and Cox's proportional hazards regression models including time-dependent covariates.
   The median follow-up time was 19.7 years (range 0.8-38.9 years). During 2575 person-years of follow up, there were 33 first-time episodes of hemorrhage from previously unruptured aneurysms, for an average annual incidence of 1.3%. In 17 patients, hemorrhage led to death. The cumulative rate of bleeding was 10.5% at 10 years, 23% at 20 years, and 30.3% at 30 years after diagnosis. The diameter of the unruptured aneurysm (relative risk [RR] 1.11 per mm in diameter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1-1.23, p = 0.05) and patient age at diagnosis inversely (RR 0.97 per year, 95% CI 0.93-1, p = 0.05) were significant independent predictors for a subsequent aneurysm rupture after adjustment for sex, hypertension, and aneurysm group. Active smoking status at the time of diagnosis was a significant risk factor for aneurysm rupture (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04-2.06, p = 0.033) after adjustment for size of the aneurysm, patient age, sex, presence of hypertension, and aneurysm group. Active smoking status as a time-dependent covariate was an even more significant risk. factor for aneurysm rupture (adjusted RR 3.04, 95% CI 1.21-7.66, p = 0.02).
   Conclusions. Cigarette smoking, size of the unruptured intracranial aneurysm, and age, inversely, are important factors determining risk for subsequent aneurysm rupture. The authors conclude that such unruptured aneurysms should be surgically treated regardless of their size and of a patient's smoking status, especially in young and middle-aged adults, if this is technically possible and if the patient's concurrent diseases are not contraindications. Cessation of smoking may also be a good alternative to surgery in older patients with small-sized aneurysms.

DE Yangtze; flood; natural hazards; causes; land reclamation;
   counter-measures
AB This paper examines the main causes of the 1998 flood on the Yangtze and addresses a number of issues related to the exploitation of natural resources and counter-measures to the flood hazard. The records show that both the amount of precipitation over the catchment and the floodwater discharge from the upper basin did not exceed the historical maximum, but water levels in the middle basin were recorded much higher than the historical maximum. Human activities have greatly increased the risk of the flood hazard. Extensive reclamation of the lakes and fluvial islands in the middle basin has considerably reduced the floodwater storage and drainage capacity of these natural landscapes of the Yangtze Basin. Deforestation in the catchment area has induced soil erosion, resulting in a large amount of sediment deposited in reservoirs whose storage capacity is thus reduced. Strengthening the flood defence to protect people living on the floodplain has raised the water level during the flood. An integrated approach is needed to produce a balanced management plan that can meet the financial needs of local people in the catchment area as well as reduce flood risk to the industries and urban residents in the middle basin of the Yangtze.

AB Here the geo-environmental features, the extent and dynamics of the transformation of Sardinia's coastal landscape (Italy), the anthropic pressures and the risks to which the island is exposed as the result of natural processes or human activities are illustrated.
   The map presented here examines for the first time the various environmental risks to which the Sardinian coasts are exposed. Marine meteorological data have also been taken into account, in particular the annual mean of longitudinal energy flow.
   The aim of the research is to gather information for the integrated management and systematic monitoring of coastal areas. Particular attention has been focused on those areas already made fragile by past transformations and hence all the more vulnerable to modifications either as the result of natural (coastal, erosion, geological hazards, etc.) or human induced processes (pollution, urbanisation, alterations to drainage patterns) or both. To achieve this objective a Coastal Information System is to be developed, which will enable to show the potential for creating job opportunities and generating income in relation to the real capacity of the different coastal ecosystems and to the geo-environmental hazards to which the different areas are exposed.

AB Chorion is the major component of silkmoth eggshell. More than 95%, of its dry mass consists of proteins that have remarkable mechanical and chemical properties protecting the oocyte and the developing embryo from a wide range of environmental hazards. We present data from electron microscopy (negative staining and shadowing), X-ray diffraction and modeling studies of synthetic peptide analogues of silkmoth chorion proteins indicating that chorion is a natural amyloid, The folding and self-assembly models of chorion peptides strongly support the beta-sheet helix model of amyloid fibrils proposed recently by Blake and Serpell [Structure 4 (1996) 989-998], (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

AB Survival to 1996 was analysed for nearly 2500 veterans of World War II who were rated as 'service-connected' for multiple sclerosis as of 1956 by the then Veterans Administration. Survival from onset was defined for all white women and black men, and a random sample of white men. Median survival times from onset were 43 years (white females), 30 years (black males) and 34 years (white males), Crude 50-year survival rates were 31.5% (white females), 21.5% (black males) and 16.6% (white males), but only the white females and white males were significantly different. A proportional hazard analysis was used to identify risk factors for mortality from multiple sclerosis onset gear. Significant risk factors included male sex (risk ratio: 1.57), older age at onset (risk ratio: 1.05 per year) and high socioeconomic status (risk ratio: 1.05 per socioeconomic status category), There were no statistically significant differences in survival following multiple sclerosis onset by race or latitude of place of entry into military service, both significant risk factors associated with the development of multiple sclerosis, Standardized mortality ratios utilizing national US data (for 1956-96) showed a marked excess for all three race-sex groups of multiple sclerosis cases, with little difference among them, but with a decreasing excess over time. Relative survival rates, used to compare the survival of multiple sclerosis cases with that of other military veterans, did not differ significantly by sex-race group, nor by latitude of place of entry into military service, but did differ significantly by socioeconomic class, The lack of difference in male and female relative survival rates suggests that the significant difference in survival between male and female multiple sclerosis cases is, at least in part, a result of sex per se and not the disease.

TI Chromium transformations in natural environments: The role of biological
   and abiological. processes in chromium(VI) reduction

AB Chromium is a redox-dynamic element that has many industrial uses. As a consequence, it is often introduced at elevated levels into the surface environment through human activity. Additionally, ultramafic rocks such as serpentinite are commonly enriched in chromium, and thus can also lead to appreciable levels of this element within soils and waters. In the trivalent state, it poses little hazard to biological activity, but, unfortunately, in the hexavalent state it is very toxic, to living matter. One must;therefore assess the oxidation state of Cr in a given system and determine the potential for transformation between valence states. The objective of this paper to is review and provide new insight on reduction reactions of Cr(VI) within natural environments. A number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria demonstrate the enzymatic ability to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III); two species can even grow using Cr(VI) as the terminal electron acceptor in respiration. The ability to reduce chromium in itself is not evidence that the process will take place at appreciable levels in natural environments, however. Reduced materials such as ferrous iron or hydrogen sulfide may compete with biological pathways in the reduction of Cr(VI). On the basis of measured reaction rates and derived rate expressions, we demonstrate that biological pathways are not likely to contribute to the reduction of chromate in anaerobic systems. Ferrous iron will dominate the reduction of chromate at pH values greater than similar to 5.5, whereas hydrogen sulfide will dominate at pH values below this value. In contrast, bacteria may be the principal means by which Cr(VI) is converted to Cr(III) in aerobic environments. Thus, the process by which Cr(VI) is reduced will depend primarily on the aeration status of the system, and secondarily on pH and the concentrations of specific reduced phases.

AB To illustrate the importance of adjusting the estimates of cumulative incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related illnesses for competing risk of other causes of death, we compared unadjusted and adjusted (for competing events) incidence estimates for four AIDS illnesses: pneumocystis cavinii pneumonia (PCP), mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and esophageal candidiases. The study population was patients followed by the Johns Hopkins Hospital AIDS Service between 1989 to 1995. Ratios of 4 year unadjusted incidence estimates to 4 year adjusted incidence estimates for the four diseases ranged from 1.38 to 1.86, corresponding to cumulative death rates of 61% to 69%. For CMV, the ratios of 4 year unadjusted to adjusted incidence estimates for five groups of patients ranged from 1.5 to 2.33, corresponding to cumulative death rates of 48% to 78%. We conclude that ignoring the competing risk of death can result in substantial overestimation of disease occurrence, which may give misleading results in estimating and comparing the occurrence of a disease of interest.

TI Significance of the CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor

   RADIOTHERAPY; RECURRENCE
AB Purpose: The CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene has been associated with an increased prostate cancer risk, and the repeat length correlated with cancer stage and grade at presentation. Men with an allele length of less than or equal to 18 CAG repeats have a 2-fold increase in risk for high-stage or high-grade prostate cancer, compared with patients with a longer CAG repeat. We examined the significance of the CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene for predicting prostate cancer progression among 318 patients treated by radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer between 1987 and 1994.
   Materials and Methods: Leukocyte DNA was collected and genotyping of the CAG repeat polymorphism was performed using a PCR-based direct sequencing method. Risk ratios were calculated for developing biochemical recurrence for patients associated with an allele length of less than or equal to 18 CAG repeats, compared with patients with an allele length of >18 CAG repeats, controlling for grade, stage and serum PSA level at diagnosis using Cox proportional hazard modeling.
   Results: Overall, the CAG repeat allele was not predictive of recurrence; tumor grade, stage and PSA level at diagnosis were the only predictors of recurrence in a multivariate analysis. However, for patients at low risk for recurrence (Gleason score 2 to 6, stage pT2, and PSA less than or equal to 10 ng./ml.), the relative risk of recurrence associated with an allele of less than or equal to 18 CAG repeats was 8.07 (95% C.I., 2.02 to 32.2, p = 0.004), compared with patients with an allele length of >18 CAG repeats. In contrast, for patients at high risk of recurrence (Gleason score greater than or equal to 7, stage pT3/4, or PSA > 10 ng./ml.), the relative risk associated with the less than or equal to 18 CAG repeat allele was 0.72 (95% C.I., 0.33 to 1.57, p = 0.41), compared with patients with the >18 CAG repeat allele.
   Conclusions: The length of the CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene may be important for prostate cancer recurrence among patients who are otherwise at low risk for recurrence after radical prostatectomy. These findings have potential implications for patient selection for adjuvant treatment, and for the development of novel treatments.

AB Objective. To examine the frequency, timing, and factors associated with abnormal cognitive and motor development during the first 30 months of life in infants born to women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
   Methods. Serial neurodevelopmental assessment was performed with 595 infants born to women infected with HIV-1 in a multicenter, prospective, natural history cohort study. Survival analysis methods were used to evaluate 6 outcome events related to abnormal cognitive and motor growth (time to confirmed drop of 1 SD, time to first score <69, and time to confirmed drop of 2 SD) in Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) scores among infected (n = 114) and uninfected (n = 481) infants. Proportional hazards modeling was used to evaluate the effects of HIV infection status, prematurity, prenatal exposure to illicit drugs, maternal educational attainment, and primary language.
   Results. HIV-1 infection was significantly associated with increased risk for all outcome events related to abnormal mental and motor growth. Differences between infected and uninfected infants were apparent by 4 months of age. Prematurity was associated with increased risk for MDI <69 and PDI <69. Maternal education of <9 completed years was associated with increased risk for MDI <69. Neither prenatal exposure to illicit drugs nor primary language other than English was associated with abnormal development.
   Conclusion. A significant proportion of infants with HIV-1 infection show early and marked cognitive and motor delays or declines that may be important early indicators of HIV disease progression. These abnormalities are independent of other risk factors for developmental delay.

   Visual detection of hair in food
SO REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Under Section 402(a)(3) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act the distribution of foods which may contain repulsive or offensive matter, considered as filth, is prohibited. Filth includes contaminants such as rat, mouse, and other animal hairs and excreta; whole insects, insect parts, and excreta; and other extraneous materials which, because of their repulsiveness, would not knowingly be eaten or used. The presence of such filth renders food adulterated. Some foods, even when produced under good manufacturing practice, contain low level of natural or unavoidable defects such as dirt, insect parts, and hair that are not hazardous to health. Although the health hazard is eliminated, most consumers find the presence of "any" visible filth contaminant such as hair in a food product objectionable. The objective of this study was to determine when a defect (hair) in a food (mushrooms) is visible to a consumer by testing the visual acuity of a consumer panel under controlled laboratory conditions. Of the panelists participating in the study, when presented with a single hair on a flat surface with a solid-colored background, 27% were able to detect a l-mm hair, 58% were able to detect a 3-mm hair, and 75% were able to detect a 10-mm hair. Twenty-five percent of the panelists surveyed were able to detect a 5- or 10-mm hair on sliced, canned mushrooms. The experimental design and results of this study are discussed.

AB Objectives: To evaluate temporal trends of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and of the KS-related human herpesvirus (HHV-8) among homosexual men who seroconverted for HIV between 1984 and 1997.
   Methods: The study participants were 387 homosexual men. Changes over a period of time were assessed by estimating KS incidence rates per 1000 person-years for the periods 1984-1989, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, and 1996-1997. The proportional incidence of KS as the AIDS-defining disease for the same periods was also calculated. To evaluate a cohort effect of calendar period, Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the risk of KS by period of HIV seroconversion [i.e. before 1990 (median year of seroconversion) versus later]. Relative hazards for the four periods were estimated using competitive-risks models. We also estimated HHV-8 seroprevalence over the study period.
   Results: Forty-eight participants developed KS. Between 1984 and 1995, the incidence rate of KS per 1000 person-years increased from 3.9 to 32.8, whereas the proportional incidence decreased from 33.3 to 24.3%. The risk of developing KS after HIV seroconversion did not change when comparing the seroconversion periods (i.e. before 1990 versus later). HHV-8 seroprevalence also remained stable. The rates of KS and the relative hazards dramatically decreased after 1995.
   Conclusions: Although KS incidence rates increased up to 1995, the proportional incidence decreased, due to the higher increase in rates of other AIDS-defining diseases. The finding that the risk of developing KS after HIV seroconversion remained stable over time is consistent with the stable trend of HHV-8 seroprevalence. The dramatic decrease in KS incidence rates after 1995 coincides with combined antiretroviral therapy. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

ID ACCIDENTS
AB Protection of the public in a nuclear power plant emergency requires decision-makers to balance the time requirements from two chains of events: the events associated with a radiological release and the events involved with the response to that release. The management of these events is distributed among personnel at the nuclear plant, in the local community, and in state and federal agencies. All of these parties must coordinate their response to the emergency to assure that timely and effective protective response can be made by the risk area population. This article describes the process by which protective action recommendations (PARs) are developed in nuclear power plant emergency exercises and provides recommendations from research on emergency response in other types of natural and technological hazards.

SO AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL

DT Article
ID NATURAL-HISTORY; FRAMINGHAM; STROKE; RISK
AB Background Quantitative data on the frequency with which transition from intermittent to permanent atrial fibrillation occurs are lacking. We conducted this study to determine the proportion of patients with intermittent atrial fibrillation who progress to permanent atrial fibrillation and to investigate baseline clinical characteristics that might predict such a progression.
   Methods This retrospective cohort study included 231 patients who were seen with intermittent atrial fibrillation at a university hospital-based clinic from January 1978 through December 1997. Patients' medical records and electrocardiograms were reviewed and data were collected for all clinic visits through May 1998. The proportion of patients who remained free of transition from intermittent to permanent atrial fibrillation was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the effect of some baseline characteristics on this transition.
   Results The number of patients who remained Free of transition from intermittent to permanent atrial fibrillation was 92% (95% confidence interval 88%-96%) at 1 year and 82% (95% confidence interval 75%-88%) at 4 years. Among 5 baseline characteristics (age, sex, structural heart disease, atrial fibrillation at presentation, and use of an antiarrhythmic medicine before presentation), the 2 significant predictors of progression from intermittent to permanent atrial fibrillation were age (P = .0003) and being in atrial fibrillation at presentation (P = .0006). The hazard ratio associated with 10 years of advancing age was 1.82 (95% confidence interval 1.31-2.51), and the hazard ratio associated with atrial fibrillation at presentation was 3.56 (95% confidence interval 1.73-7.34).
   Conclusions Approximately 18% of patients who had intermittent atrial fibrillation were permanently in atrial fibrillation after 4 years of follow-up. Age and being in atrial fibrillation at presentation were the only 2 important clinical variables identified in predicting such a progression.

AB Background: A large increase of allergy to latex proteins has been observed lately probably as a result of a great use of latex-containing goods. At present these untoward reactions have led to consideration of this problem as a health and occupational hazard. It is therefore, necessary to identify the allergens contained in latex-manufactured products and to develop effective diagnostic tools to detect sensitized individuals.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to identify antigenic and allergenic components in latex condoms by using chemical, immunochemical, and immunoenzymatic methods.
   Methods: The protein content of extracts obtained from several brands of condoms was determined and characterized by using a modified Lowry method, a quantitative ELISA assay and SDS-PAGE. The allergenic behavior of these proteins was studied by IgE immunoblotting, EAST and ELISA techniques, using sera from subjects allergic to latex products, particularly to latex condoms.
   Results: Wide variations in the protein content (38 to 740 mu g/g product) and composition were observed. The SDS-PAGE protein profiles showed components ranging from 7 to 94 kD of relative molecular weights; most of them were also detected in natural rubber latex. The most prominent bands were revealed in the 14 and 30 kD zones. A strong band of 69 kD in the SDS-PAGE profiles would correspond to a neoantigen, since it was not observed in natural latex. The immunoblotting analysis employing sera from 5 patients allergic to latex condoms showed the presence of 4 components with IgE binding capacity (14, 30, 69, and 94 kD). The EAST and ELISA methods showed the presence of allergens in all the condom brands studied.
   Conclusions: The presence of allergenic proteins in several condom brands was demonstrated by different immunoenzymatic methods.

AB Dangers from natural hazards have been characterized quantitatively by national and international committees of geoscientists based on technical advances in geochemistry and geophysics (sensu lato). The current status of knowledge on natural hazards is reviewed with particular emphasis on comet/asteroid impact, earthquakes, and volcanoes. All these hazards are survivable by the world's population if appropriate measures are taken over the next century and millennium. Ideas for mitigation include: general use of weathered volcanic ash and power-station fly ash to make pozzolana cement for strengthening buildings, and stabilizing weak ground and hillsides prone to slumping; long-term storage of grains under nitrogen, together with other techniques for maintaining viability of stored food; drilling of tunnels under major cities to facilitate traffic flow, and for protection against impact of bolides and bombs; design of sea and lake fronts to guard against tsunamis from earthquakes and asteroid impact. The food-storage proposals could be tailored to help farmers obtain a regular income while producing a higher crop yield than needed for current food supply. The land modification plans would provide technical challenges and new business activities for civil engineers, lawyers, real-estate professionals, and city planners. It is truly tragic that genuine ideas for mitigation of natural hazards are being implemented at a snail's pace while funding for weapons nourishes around much of the world. The early development of my thinking on hazards is an example of the typical disconnection between "scientific expertise" and actual day-to-day planning decisions. As a farmer's boy interested in civil engineering and land planning in an ecological context, I summarize old and new ideas in an effort to bridge this disconnection, and facilitate the planned transfer of funding from weapons to actions that enhance human well being. Because the actions are international in their basic nature and ecological in character, I hope that they will help to generate a feeling of "One world that must be loved, not abused." We belong to one biological species, Homo supposedly sapiens sapiens. We must progress beyond tribal, ethnic, and other divisive matters associated with wars and civilian conflicts. The rich must help the poor. Geology and civil engineering can provide important worldwide cooperative connections.

ID TIME-SERIES; POLLUTION
AB A portion of a population is assumed to be at risk, with the mortality hazard varying with atmospheric conditions including total suspended particulates (TSP). This at-risk population is not observed and the hazard function is unknown; we wish to estimate these from mortality count and atmospheric variables. Consideration of population dynamics leads to a state-space representation, allowing the Kalman Filter (KF) to be used for estimation. A harvesting effect is thus implied; high mortality is followed by lower mortality until the population is replenished by new arrivals.
   The model is applied to daily data for Philadelphia, PA, 1973-1990. The estimated hazard function rises with the level of TSP and at extremes of temperature and also reflects a positive interaction between TSP and temperature. The estimated at-risk population averages about 480 and varies seasonally. We find that lags of TSP are statistically significant, but the presence of negative coefficients suggests their role may be partially statistical rather than biological. In the population dynamics framework, the natural metric for health damage from air pollution is its impact on life expectancy. The range of hazard rates over the sample period is 0.07 to 0.085, corresponding to life expectancies of 14.3 and 11.8 days, respectively.

AB A longitudinal study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals followed-up in 13 centres was performed to assess the influence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) on the clinical and immunological evolution of HIV-infected patients. Eight-hundred and twelve HIV-infected patients with known HIV acquisition date, 89 co-infected with HCV, were included in the cohort. Clinical progression was defined as: 30% decrease of Karnofsky's index; and/or 20% body weight loss; and/or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness; and/or death (except by accident, suicide, or overdose). Immunological progression was defined as a decrease of initial CD4 count to below 200 mm(-3). If immunological progression was not statistically different between groups (P=0.25), clinical progression was significantly faster in HCV-HIV co-infected patients in univariate (P=0.02) and multivariable survival analysis (hazard ratio=1.63, P=0.03). This argues for active management of hepatitis C chronic infection among HCV-HIV co-infected patients.

TI A revised natural history model for primary sclerosing cholangitis
SO MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS

DT Article

   SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA; VALIDATION; EFFICACY
AB Objective: To describe a natural history model for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) that is based on routine clinical findings and test results and eliminates the need for liver biopsy.
   Patients and Methods: Using the Cox proportional hazards analysis, we created a survival model based on 405 patients with PSC from 5 clinical centers. Independent validation of the model was undertaken by applying it to 124 patients who were not included in the model creation.
   Results: Based on the multivariate analysis of 405 patients, a risk score was defined by the following formula: R = 0.03 (age [y]) + 0.54 log(e) (bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 0.54 log(e) (aspartate aminotransferase [U/L]) + 1.24 (variceal bleeding [0/1]) - 0.84 (albumin [g/dL]), The risk score was used to obtain survival estimates up to 4 years of follow-up. Application of this model to an Independent group of 124 patients showed good correlation between estimated and actual survival,
   Conclusions: A new model to estimate patient survival in PSC includes more reproducible variables (age, bilirubin, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, and history of variceal bleeding), has accuracy comparable to previous models, and obviates the need for a liver biopsy.

TI Diurnal cortisol rhythm as a predictor of breast cancer survival

AB Background: Abnormal circadian rhythms have been observed in patients with cancer, but the prognostic value of such alterations has not been confirmed. We examined the association between diurnal variation of salivary cortisol in patients with metastatic breast cancer and subsequent survival. We explored relationships between cortisol rhythms, circulating natural killer (NK) cell counts and activity, prognostic indicators, medical treatment, and psychosocial variables. Methods: Salivary cortisol levels of 104 patients with metastatic breast cancer were assessed at study entry at 0800, 1200, 1700, and 2100 hours on each of 3 consecutive days, and the slope of diurnal cortisol variation was calculated using a regression of log-transformed cortisol concentrations on sample collection time. NK cell numbers were measured by flow cytometry, and NK cell activity was measured by the chromium release assay. The survival analysis was conducted by the Cox proportional hazards regression model with two-sided statistical testing. Results: Cortisol slope predicted subsequent survival up to 7 years later. Earlier mortality occurred among patients with relatively "flat" rhythms, indicating a lack of normal diurnal variation (Cox proportional hazards, P = .0036), Patients with chest metastases, as opposed to those with visceral or bone metastases, had more rhythmic cortisol profiles, Flattened profiles were linked with low counts and suppressed activity of NK cells. After adjustment for each of these and other factors, the cortisol slope remained a statistically significant, independent predictor of survival time. NK cell count emerged as a secondary predictor of survival. Conclusions: Patients with metastatic breast cancer whose diurnal cortisol rhythms were flattened or abnormal had earlier mortality. Suppression of NK cell count and NK function may be a mediator or a marker of more rapid disease progression.

AB Three serovars of Salmonella choleraesuis (IIIb 61:k: 1,5,(7), Enteritidis and Dublin) were grown in broths of pH 5.5 and 6.2 and incubated at 4, 6, 8 or 12 degrees C. Growth in the broth, measured by means of an increase of absorbance, was not observed below 8 degrees C. At 8 and 12 degrees C, the maximum growth rate (mu(max)), lag period and maximum absorbance level (max(abs)) varied according to serovar and pH. In general, serovar IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7) and serovar Enteritidis grew better than serovar Dublin. The effect of pH on lag period, seen for serovar IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7) and serovar Enteritidis at 8 degrees C, was absent at 12 degrees C, while the effect of pH regarding the mu(max) and the max(abs) was observed also at 12 degrees C. Furthermore, the growth serovar IIIb 61:k: 1,5,(7) in normal and dark, firm and dry meat at 8 degrees C with ambient air in competition with the natural microbial flora was tested in minced meat and chops. Slow growth of serovar IIIb 61:k:1,5,(7) was observed in minced meat. The low virulence and the ordinary growth capabilities indicate that serovar mb 61:k:1,5,(7) will probably not represent a serious hazard to the public health. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB PURPOSE: We investigated the relationship between disk hemorrhage in normal tension glaucoma and the progression of visual field defects and, additionally, whether hemorrhage plays a role in the pathogenic process of the chronic disease.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 70 patients with normal tension glaucoma (mean followup, 5.6 years) who were not medicated for glaucoma, and we applied a regression analysis of survival data based on the Cox proportional hazards model. Several clinical factors were investigated to find a possible association with the progression of glaucomatous visual field defined by two different definitions: one by mean deviation change and the other by glaucoma change probability analysis. visual field loss in 65.4% of progressive patients with disk hemorrhage,
   CONCLUSIONS: Several clinical factors other than intraocular pressure are significantly associated with the progression of visual field loss during the natural course of normal-tension glaucoma. Among these, disk hemorrhage is a significantly negative prognostic factor in patients with normal tension glaucoma and may be a sign of progressive damage of the retinal nerve fiber layer, leading to functional deterioration of the visual field.

ID ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB The toxicity and environmental fate of the insecticide-miticide. pyridaben were investigated using both standardized laboratory procedures and outdoor studies with natural water. Outdoor studies provide a more realistic exposure scenario to aquatic organisms and any toxicity is a response to actual exposure concentrations resulting from the natural degradation and dissipation of the chemical. This paper describes the environmental chemistry/fate and aquatic toxicity of pyridaben. The subsequent paper describes the results of the outdoor aquatic toxicity studies and the use of the water-effect ratio in hazard/risk assessment. Environmental fate studies indicate that pyridaben has a low water solubility and high K-d and K-oc values, which favors partitioning from water onto soil and sediment. Pyridaben is stable to hydrolysis but has a short photolysis half-life in water (<30 min) and soil (similar to 11 d). Furthermore, pyridaben has a short half-life in soil(12 to 14 d) when applied in the field to citrus crops. Laboratory studies with constant 48- to 96-h exposures to pyridaben show it is acutely toxic to fish (Lepomis macrochirus, Pimephales promelas, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Cyprinodon variegatus) and invertebrates (Daphnia magna, Mysidopsis bahia). Invertebrates are more sensitive (lower LC50s) than fish to pyridaben, and most mortalities occur < 24 h for fish and < 72 h for invertebrates. Chronic laboratory studies indicate that the MATCs for pyridaben and D. magna, M. bahia and P. promelas were 0.12, 0.15 and 0.39 mu g/L, respectively. Acute-to-chronic ratios for pyridaben are low for fish and invertebrates, indicating a low potential for residual activity. Chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms is not an issue after application in the field because exposures tend to be brief.

   transgenic fish
AB Transgenic fish have many potential applications in aquaculture, but also raise concerns regarding the possible deleterious effects of escaped or released transgenic fish on natural ecosystems. In this review the potential applications risk to the environment identified and the measures which might be taken to minimize these risks are evaluated. Growth trials of transgenic fish have already been carried out in outdoor facilities and some of these are discussed in the light of possible risks and benefits. Regarding the hazards associated with release or escape, whilst there is some evidence to suggest that transgenic fish may be less fit compared to there is wild counterparts, there is insufficient evidence to say that this will be true in all cases. Using mathematical models, we have attempted to predict the magnitude of the genetic effects in a range of different scenarios. A number of possible containment techniques are considered, amongst which containment by sterility is probably the most promising. This can be engineered either by triploidy or by transgenic methods. The conclusions include a tabulated balance sheet of likely benefits and risks with appropriate weighting.

AB Previous research has indicated that certain characteristics appear to affect the extent to which populations prepare for natural hazards. In an effort to investigate the effects of the mechanisms of PrE theory on the relationship between population characteristics and preparedness actions, relevant data were assessed for 3 separate population types. Results indicated that homeowners were more prepared for tornadoes than were renters, who in turn were more prepared for tornadoes than were students. Furthermore, homeowners appraised their preparedness resources as greater than the perceived threat of a tornado, and felt more responsible for preparing for tornadoes than did renters; who in turn appraised their preparedness resources as greater than the perceived threat of a tornado, and felt more responsible for preparing for tornadoes than did students.

   sample
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper expands the work on perception of risk to the Self from hazards in the environment by developing psychological aspects of ecological risk perception, which have received little attention to date. Responses from 159 university students to a 26-item scale of Environmental hazard perception, an adaptation of Schmidt and Gifford's (1989) Environmental Appraisal Inventory (EAI), were factor analysed and a 20-item scale with three subscales was developed. The subscales represented techno-human, natural, and everyday-life hazards, and these are the first subscales to be developed on the EAI. Psychometric properties of the scales are discussed and cultural differences in hazard identification are addressed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI Influence of gypsification on engineering behavior of expansive clay
SO JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Volume change in argillaceous sediments can take place due to either swelling of expansive clay or gypsification of anhydrous calcium sulfate. Gypsification offers a variety of serious geotechnical hazards such as high swell pressure, Boor heave in tunnels, massive rock uplift in dams, and damages to light structures and pavements. Some of these phenomena have been observed in the Arabian Gulf coastal region, where the behavior of local argillaceous sediments is controlled by severe climatic and environmental conditions. Based on laboratory investigation of natural and synthetic samples, this paper studies the influence of gypsification of anhydrite on the engineering behavior of calcareous expansive clay.

AB A primary purpose of electric lighting is to aid vision in conditions when natural light (daylight, sunlight) is unavailable. Such conditions occur at night and indoors. Lighting recommendations of organizations such as the IESNA are almost entirely based on requirements for visibility.1
   An increasing body of evidence exists to support the effects of light and lighting in psychological and physiological areas of life. Light affects moods, metabolism and even communicates meaning. Light is used therapeutically to combat depression, to rid the body of toxins, and to reset the body's internal circadian clock.(2) With such capacity to impact human life, it is reasonable to suppose the use of light might also carry certain risks. This brief review discusses one specific type of potential risk associated with light - namely, the ability of short-wavelength ("blue") light of sufficient intensity and duration to cause photochemical damage to title visual system.

TI Method of selecting design EarthQuake Ground Motions for tall buildings
SO STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
AB In most current seismic design procedures, an earthquake hazard of the design earthquake load is usually defined as a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years. However, tall buildings and emergency hazard facilities need to be safe against more severe ground shakings than code-defined design earthquake hazards. Earthquake hazard can be expressed by a 5% damped Linear Elastic Design Response Spectrum (LEDRS) obtained from statistical research using spectral responses of selected EarthQuake Ground Motion (EQGM). In tall buildings that have severe irregularity in plan and elevation or have long natural periods, the use of EQGM records as input loads is recommended instead of using LEDRS. The objectives of this study are to determine the LEDRS considering return periods and to calibrate the EQGM records for making their response spectra fit the determined LEDRS. The parameters of calibration for selecting the EQGMs are investigated. In this study 22, 14 and 8 EQGMs are selected for S-1, S-2, S-3 soil sites, respectively. Selected EQGM records from this study can be used for time-history analysis as an input earthquake load, especially for low and moderate seismic zone. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background-Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a poorly recognized entity of unknown cause characterized by nondilated, nonhypertrophied ventricles with diastolic dysfunction resulting in dilated atria and variable systolic function.
   Methods and Results-Between 1979 and 1996, 94 patients (61% women) 10 to 90 years old (mean, 64 years) met strict morphological echocardiographic criteria for idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy, mainly dilated atria with nonhypertrophied, nondilated ventricles. None had known infiltrative disease, hypertension of >5 years' duration, or cardiac or systemic conditions associated with restrictive filling. Nineteen percent were in NYHA class I, 53% in class II, and 28% in class III or IV. Atrial fibrillation was noted in 74% of patients and systolic dysfunction in 16%. Follow-up (mean, 68 months) was complete for 93 patients (99%). At follow-up, 47 patients (50%) had died, 32 (68%) of cardiovascular causes. Four had heart transplantation. The death rate compared with actuarial statistics was significantly higher than expected (P<0.0001), Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival was 64%, compared with expected survival of 85%. Multivariate analysis using proportional hazards showed that the risk of death approximately doubles with male sex (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.1), left atrial dimension >60 mm (HR=2.3), age >70 years (HR=2.0), and each increment of NYHA class (HR=2.0).
   Conclusions-Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy or nondilated, nonhypertrophic ventricles with marked biatrial dilatation, as defined morphologically by echocardiography, affects predominantly elderly patients but can occur in any age group. Patients present with systemic and pulmonary venous congestion and atrial fibrillation and have a poor prognosis, particularly men >70 years old with higher NYHA class and left atrial dimension >60 mm.

AB Objective: To study the natural history and the current risk factors for cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in the context of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
   Setting: Prospective multicentre cohort in 15 university hospitals in France.
   Methods: A group of 198 patients with CD4 cell count < 100 x 10(6) cells/l (or < 200 X 10(6) cells/l under HAART for at least 2 months), no previous CMV disease and CMV-positive serology were followed every 4 months clinically and for virological testing including HIV RNA and CMV blood markers (culture, pp65 antigenaemia, plasma CMV DNA and CMV late mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction).
   Results: At inclusion, median CD4 was 77 X 10(6) cells/l (0-308) and 85% of the patients received protease inhibitors. The percentage of patients receiving HAART reached 99% at 12 months. After a follow-up of 23.6 months, the incidence of CMV disease was 3.2/100 patient-years [95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.3-5.0]. In univariate Cox models, all the CMV markers, a CD4 cell count remaining < 75 x 10(6) cells/l and an HIV viral load > 100 000 copies/ml were predictive for CMV disease. The hazard ratios for CMV disease were 11 for blood culture; 14 and 70 for pp65 antigenaemia of greater than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 100 nuclei/200 000 cells, respectively; 35 for plasma CMV DNA; 6 for CMV mRNA; 29 for CD4 < 75 x 106 cells/l; and 12 for HIV RNA > 100 000 copies/ml. In a stepwise multivariate analysis, only three covariates were independently associated with the occurrence of a disease: plasma CMV DNA, pp65 antigenaemia greater than or equal to 100 nuclei/200 000 cells and a CD4 count < 75 x 10(6) cells/l.
   Conclusion: CMV blood markers and CD4 count < 75 x 106 cells/l remain risk factors for CMV disease in patients receiving HAART. Analysis of plasma CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction is a reproducible and standardized tool that could be used as a decision marker for initiating CMV pre-emptive therapy.

AB Multi-wave self-report data on age at menopause in 2182 female twin pairs (1355 monozygotic and 827 dizygotic pairs), were analysed to estimate the genetic, common and unique environmental contribution to variation in age at menopause. Two complementary approaches for analysing correlated time-to-onset twin data are considered: the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method in which one can estimate zygosity-specific dependence simultaneously with regression coefficients that describe the average population response to changing covariates; and a subject-specific Bayesian mixed model in which heterogeneity in regression parameters is explicitly modelled and the different components of variation may be estimated directly. The proportional hazards and Weibull models were utilized, as both produce natural frameworks for estimating relative risks while adjusting for simultaneous effects of other covariates. A simple Markov chain Monte Carlo method for covariate imputation of missing data was used and the actual implementation of the Bayesian model was based on Gibbs sampling using the freeware package BUGS.

AB Objective: This study aimed to describe the natural course of DSM-III-R alcohol disorders as a function of age at first alcohol use and to investigate the influence of early use as a risk factor for progression to the development of alcohol disorders, exclusive of the effect of confounding influences.
   Method: Data were obtained from a community sample (N=5,856) of lifetime drinkers participating in the 1990-1991 Mental Health Supplement of the Ontario Health Survey.
   Results: Survival analyses revealed a rapid progression to alcohol-related harm among those who reported having their first drink at ages 11-14. After 10 years, 13.5% of the subjects who began to drink at ages 11 and 12 met the criteria for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, and 15.9% had a diagnosis of dependence. Rates for subjects who began to drink at ages 13 and 14 were 13.7% and 9.0%, respectively. In contrast, rates for those who started drinking at ages 19 and older were 2.0% and 1.0%. Unexpectedly, a delay in progression to harm was observed for the youngest drinkers (ages 10 and under). Hazard regression analyses revealed a nonlinear effect of age at first alcohol use, marked by an elevated risk of developing disorders among subjects first using alcohol at ages 11-14.
   Conclusions: First use of alcohol at ages 11-14 greatly heightens the risk of progression to the development of alcohol disorders and therefore is a reasonable target for intervention strategies that seek to delay first use as a means of averting problems later in life.

ID PRECISION
AB A regional geochemical reconnaissance survey of the Cordillera Occidental of Ecuador was initiated in 1995 as a sub-component of a wider Mining Development and Environmental Control Technical Assistance Project (PRODEMINCA) in Ecuador. The 36,000 km(2) survey area encompasses oceanic and continental-margin volcanosedimentary terranes with known occurrences of porphyry-style Cu-Mo, exhalative massive sulphide, epithermal Au and mesothermal polymetallic mineralisation. A survey sample medium of < 177 mu m stream sediments was selected following an orientation study in the vicinity of known porphyry Cu mineralisation. In the 2-4 degrees S sector of the Cordillera Occidental for which data are presented, 4850 drainage samples were collected at an average density of 1 per 2.57 km2. All were analysed for 36 major and trace elements (Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo, Ni, Co, Cd, Bi, As, Sb, Fe, Hg, Mn, Te, Pa, Cr V, Sn, W, La, Al, Mg, Ca, Na, K, Sr, Y, Ga, Li, Nb, Sc, Ta, Ti, Zr). A stringent quality-control procedure included the systematic analysis of certified reference samples, field duplicates and replicates, data for which were used to calculate analytical precision, temporal drift and practical detection limits. Results for this part of the cordillera highlight the contrasting lithogeochemical signatures of the ocean-floor basalt terrane (Pallatanga Unit), the island-arc terrane of the Macuchi Unit, the continental volcanics of the Saraguro Group and the acid and intermediate lavas extruded from the Late Miocene to the Quaternary. Regional geochemical images for Au and associated pathfinder elements are dominated by anomalies relating to known mines and prospects. New exploration targets, often inconspicuous at the regional scale, have however been identified through the normalisation of data for individual lithological units against their respective geochemical backgrounds. In addition to mineral exploration, the drainage geochemical dataset for the Cordillera Occidental provides an unparalleled environmental baseline against which the impacts of future anthropogenic activities (including mining) may be assessed. A basis for the formulation of pragmatic sediment quality criteria and for the identification of natural geochemical hazards is also provided. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of self-organized criticality evolved from studies of three simple cellular-automata models: the forest-fire, slider-block, and sandpile models. Each model is associated with natural hazards, which have frequency-size statistics that are well approximated by power-law distributions. These distributions have important implications for probabilistic hazard assessments.

DT Article
ID LEACHATE; WATER; WASTE; PARAMETERS; BIOASSAYS; ASSAYS
AB The aim of the present study was to describe the occurrence and distribution of toxicity related to organic chemical contaminants in the leachate plume downgradient of the Grindsted Landfill (Denmark). A total of 27 groundwater samples were preconcentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using XAD-2 as the resin material. This treatment effectively eliminated sample matrix toxicity caused by inorganic salts and natural organic compounds and produced an aqueous concentrate of the nonvolatile chemical contaminants. The SPE extracts were tested in a battery of standardized short-term aquatic toxicity tests with luminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri), algae (Selenastrum capricornutum), and crustaceans (Daphnia magna). Additional genotoxicity tests were made using the umuC test (Salmonella typhimurium). Biotests with algae and luminescent bacteria were the most sensitive tests. On the basis of results with these two bioassays, it was concluded that SPE extracts of groundwater collected close to the landfill were toxic. The toxicity decreased with the distance from the landfill. At distances greater than 80 m from the border of the landfill, the groundwater toxicity was not significantly different from the background toxicity. SPE extracts were not toxic to Daphnia (preconcentration factor 10), and no genotoxicity was observed in the umuC test (preconcentration factor up to 120). The overall findings indicate that a battery of biotests applied on preconcentrated groundwater samples can be a useful tool for toxicity characterization and hazard ranking of groundwater polluted with complex chemical mixtures, such as landfill leachates.

ID ESOPHAGEAL-VARICES; SURVIVAL
AB Objectives and methods: The prognostic factors have not yet been fully evaluated in patients with cirrhosis and gastric fundal varices (FV). We investigated the natural history of 145 patients with cirrhosis and FV with no history of bleeding. Various possible prognostic factors, which include clinical, biochemical, and endoscopical variables. were analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard model. Results: Among the 145 patients with cirrhosis and FV, there were 76 patients in class A. 45 in class B and 24 class C according to Child's classification. Sixty-five patients had concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma at the time of enrollment. Seventy deaths and 34 episodes of the hemorrhage from FV occurred during the mean follow-up period of 26.4 months. The cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 75, 53 and 34%, respectively. The cause of death was related to gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 18 patients (15 deaths wen related to FV hemorrhage), hepatic failure in 22, hepatocellular carcinoma in 22, and other causes in eight patients. In patients with small-, medium-, and large-sized FV, the deaths: related to FV hemorrhage were 4, 21 and 54%, respectively. Overall, the death related to FV hemorrhage was 21%. A multiple regression analysis using Cox's model showed hemorrhage from FV, the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma and poor Child's status were all highly significant prognostic factors. Conclusion: The natural history of the patients with cirrhosis and FV was adversely modified by the hemorrhage From FV. concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma and pool hepatic functional reserve. Since the number of deaths related to FV hemorrhage was great in patients with large-sized FV, it is important to identify high-risk large FV and its prophylactic obliteration. Further studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy of prophylactic obliteration of large-sized FV. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are also generated by phase coupling with atmospheric gravity waves arising through powerful volcanic activity. The AD 1883 Krakatau eruption generated volcano-meteorological tsunamis that were recorded globally. Because of its extreme violence and energy release (greater than or equal to 150 +/- 50 megatons explosive yield), and by analogy with the Krakatau event, it is highly possible that the ignimbrite-emplacement phase of the c. AD 200 Taupo eruption of North Island, New Zealand, generated a similar volcano-meteorological tsunami that may have reached coastal areas worldwide. Tsunami deposits of identical age to the Taupo eruption occur in central coastal New Zealand and probably relate to that event; definitive evidence elsewhere has not yet been found. In theory, volcano-meteorological tsunamis are likely to be produced during comparable eruptive events at other explosive volcanoes, and thus represent an additional volcanic hazard at coastal sites far from source. We suggest that evidence for such tsunamis, both for marine and lacustrine environments, may be preserved in geological records, and that further work searching for this evidence using a facies approach is timely.

TI Comparison of the burning behaviour of electric cables with intumescent
   coating in different test methods
SO KERNTECHNIK
LA English
DT Article
AB Cables used for electric power and control systems represent a significant potential hazard, particularly in buildings with highly complex wiring. To reduce the risk of ignition and of flame spread and to limit the fire effects, protective intumescent coatings or cables with fire retardant insulation materials have been implemented in safety related areas and locations particularly of nuclear power plants. Since 1994, extensive experimental research has been performed by iBMB of the Braunschweig University of Technology on the burning behaviour of unprotected as well as coated PVC cables. The main goal of this investigations was to develop a qualification method and licensing procedure for cable systems with protective coatings based on realistic fire conditions which is accepted by the building authorities for application in buildings in general and in particular, in nuclear power plants. For comparative results of tests with intumescent coatings in different scales - according to the standard IEC 332-3 (large scale), German standard DIN 4102-1 (intermediate scale) and ISO 5660 (small scale) - will be introduced. The setup of the different rest procedures and the corresponding phases of natural fives will be discussed. It will be shown that cables with protective coatings are appropriate for fire scenarios up to a developed room fire while only resistance to a local ignition source could be guaranteed by testing according to international or national valid standard. The necessity of testing cables with insulation material, which should guarantee a fire retardant behaviour, by these different methods should be reasonable, because depending on the results of future tests a more distinguished qualification and application of cables might be possible.

AB The El Nino of 1997-1998 produced the most intense impact on the conterminous U.S.A., generating a series of powerful rain and wind storms off the coast of California in early February 1998. The 1997-1998 El Nino also produced severe flooding and extensive mud slides along the west coast of South America and prolonged drought conditions in northeast Brazil. On the other (west) side of the equatorial Pacific, the El Nino produced the worst drought in 50 years over Indonesia and helped spread the ongoing forest fires on the island of Borneo to well over one million acres. In this paper, the smoke and pollution problem over Malaysia will be analyzed in the context of ongoing Indonesian forest fires and the severity of the 1997 El Nino - a deadly combination which led to the most hazardous smoke problem over Malaysia during August-September 1997. The severity of the smoke pollution is documented using media reports and available API (air pollution index) values over selected cities in Malaysia. The role of the El Nino and its evolution in enhancing the smoke pollution over Malaysia is further discussed and suitably documented. Some of the mitigation measures presently being adopted in Malaysia to combat the smoke pollution are briefly discussed.

AB Volcanic catastrophes constitute a major problem in many developing and developed countries. In recent years population growth and the expansion of settlements and basic supply lines (e.g., water, gas, etc.) have greatly increased the impact of volcanic disasters. Correct land-use planning is fundamental in minimising both loss of life and damage to property. In this contribution Geographical Information Systems (GIS), linked with remote sensing technology and telecommunications/warning systems, have emerged as one of the most promising tools to support the decision-making process. Some GIS are presented for two volcanic areas in Italy, Mt. Etna and Vesuvius. GIS role in risk management is then discussed, keeping in mind the different volcanic scenarios of effusive and explosive phenomena. Mt. Etna system covers a large area (more than 1,000 km(2)) potentially affected by effusive phenomena (lava flows) which cause damage to both houses and properties in general. No risk to life is expected. The time-scales of lava flows allow, at least in principle, modification of the lava path by the building of artificial barriers. Vesuvius shows typically an explosive behaviour. In the case of a medium size explosive eruption, 600,000 people would potentially have to be evacuated from an area of about 200 km(2) around the Volcano, since they are exposed to ruinous, very fast phenomena like pyroclastic surges and flows, lahars, ash fallout, etc. Ash fallout and floods/lahars are also expected in distal areas, between Vesuvius and Avellino, downwind of the volcano. GIS include digital elevation models, satellite images, volcanic hazard maps and vector data on natural and artificial features (energy supply lines, strategic buildings, roads, railways, etc.). The nature and the level of detail in the two data bases are different, on the basis of the different expected volcanic phenomena. The GIS have been planned: (a) for volcanic risk mitigation (hazard, value, vulnerability and risk map assessing), (b) to provide suitable tools during an impending crisis, (c) to provide a basis for emergency plans.

AB This paper describes a spatial-dynamic, stochastic optimization model that takes account of the complexities and dependencies of catastrophic risks. Following a description of the general model, the paper briefly discusses a case study of earthquake risk in the Irkutsk region of Russia. For this purpose the risk management model is customized to explicitly incorporate the geological characteristics of the region, as well as the seismic hazards and the vulnerability of the built environment. In its general form, the model can analyze the interplay between investment in mitigation and risk-sharing measures. In the application described in this paper, the model generates insurance strategies that are less vulnerable to insolvency.

AB To determine the effect of support groups on survival, the authors retrospectively studied 21 HIV-seropositive women who died during the course of participation in a natural history study of HIV. Groups were composed of women who self-selected HIV support groups before death (n = 11) and a comparison group (n = 10). Survival analysis found group participation to be associated with increased longevity (73 months vs. 45 months; P = 0.011). Proportional-hazards regression demonstrated that HIV-related support groups and smaller family size significantly influenced survival (P = 0.0002). Factors related to group participation and ways in which support groups might promote longevity are discussed.

AB The recent outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo has put the filovirus threat hack on the international health agenda. This paper gives an overview of Marburg and Ebola. outbreaks so far observed and puts them in a public health perspective. Damage on the local level has been devastating at times, but was marginal on the international level despite the considerable media attention these outbreaks received. The potential hazard of outbreaks, however. after export of filovirus from its natural environment into metropolitan areas, is argued to be considerable. Some avenues fur future research and intervention are explored. Beyond the obvious need to find the reservoir and study the natural history, public health strategies for a more timely and efficient response are urgently needed.

ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES
AB The rapid growth of many cities in the developing world, especially in the tropics, has resulted in the increased incidence and severity of urban environmental hazards, such as slope failure and flooding. In many regions, heavy rainfall events or alterations to natural environmental characteristics often trigger the incidence of hazards. For some cities, vulnerability to hazards is often exacerbated by local topographic conditions. In the case of Latin America, despite a relative decline in overall population growth in many cities, physical expansion during the past few decades has resulted in increased vulnerability, with the occupation of hillsides, slopes and other land subject to instability. In assessing urban vulnerability, the physical characteristics of the environment as well as human modifications consequent on urban growth need to be examined. This paper considers and examines the vulnerability of urban settlements to hazard (landslide) risk through a case study of Niteroi city. Niteroi, which forms part of the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, has in recent years experienced significant increases in the levels of environmental vulnerability through continued urban expansion pressures, natural resource exploitation and new processes of land use change in an area characterized by mountainous topography. The paper attempts to provide a better understanding of the causative factors of landslides and of their impact, and to suggest ways such phenomena can be better managed.

AB The production of adequate and safe drinking water is a high priority issue for safeguarding the health and well-being of humans all over the world. Traditionally, microbiological quality of drinking water has been the main concern, but over the last decades the attention of the general public and health officials on the importance of chemical quality and the threat of chemical pollutants have increased with the increase of our knowledge on the hazards of chemical substances. There are many sources of contamination of drinking water. Broadly they can be divided into two categories: contaminants originating from surface and groundwater, and contaminants used or formed during the treatment and distribution of drinking water. Contaminants in surface and groundwater can range from natural substances such as arsenic and manganese leaching from soil, to contaminants introduced by human activities, such as run-off from agricultural activities, controlled discharge from sewage treatment works and industrial plants, and uncontrolled discharges or leakage from landfill sites and from chemical accidents. Disinfectants and disinfectant by-products are well known contaminants resulting from the processes used by the drinking water industry for the treatment and distribution of water. The basic question in the production of drinking water is how to rid drinking water of potentially dangerous microorganisms and chemicals without introducing new hazards that might pose new and different threats to human health. It is the responsibility of toxicologists to provide risk assessments for chemical pollutants and to derive guidelines or standards for drinking water quality below which no significant health risk is encountered, to assure consumers that drinking water is safe and can be consumed without any risk. This paper will focus on the toxicological procedures used by the World Health Organization to derive guideline values for chemical compounds in drinking water, and will touch upon some critical differences in the nature of guidelines and legally binding standards.

ID SPECIATION; FRACTIONATION
AB The recognition of the potential health hazards associated with heavy metals has focused attention on the levels and behaviours of these elements both in natural and contaminated environments. Various soil types developed from different parent materials in Sicily, Italy, have been analysed in order to compare heavy metal distribution under different geopedological conditions. Total metal concentrations, metal partitioning and distribution profiles are discussed in relation to the inheritance factor and pedogenic processes. Parent material composition largely influences the contents of heavy metals in most of the analysed soils, mainly differentiating pedons for their metal concentration on the basis of sedimentary and volcanic parent materials. However, an exception is represented by the carbonate-free Alfisols and Mollisols, which are markedly enriched in heavy metals with respect to the underlying limestones and calcarenites, On the basis of chemical and mineralogical results, supported by data from sequential extraction (SEP), heavy metal enrichment in these soils is associated with the formation of common to abundant Fe-Mn oxides and clay accumulation. For Mollisols there is evidence for a major role of organic matter in heavy metal retention in surface horizons. In the other pedons, pedogenic processes appear to mainly influence the redistribution of heavy metals throughout the soil horizons rather than affecting the total content. Argillopedoturbation seems to be responsible for a uniform distribution of heavy metals in Vertisol profiles on marry clays. Accumulation of heavy metals in the topsoil of Inceptisols on clays with gypsum and Entisols on gypsarenites and diatomites is caused partially by adsorption on organic matter and mainly by dissolution of primary gypsum and opal-A. A pedogenic influence is less evident in young Andisols whose heavy metal composition greatly reflects that of hawaiitic pyroclastic deposits interbedded within the profiles. However, a certain redistribution of Cu accumulated as metal-organic matter complexes is evidenced in the surface horizon by SEP. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Wildlife hazard assessment for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
SO INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION

AB We examined wildlife abundance, distribution, and movement patterns at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) and within an 8-km radius to assess current air-strike hazards, and to provide baseline information for projecting changes in air-strike hazards as land-use patterns around PHX change. We found that water sources at or near PHX especially induced wildlife movement patterns that put air traffic at risk. This was particularly true of the Salt River bed adjacent to the airport, which also is a natural flight corridor for birds. Compounding the problem, air traffic at PHX was the heaviest when bird abundance and activity was the greatest during migration and breeding. We feel that air strike hazards at PHX are likely to increase substantially as the Salt River bed is reclaimed to produce additional lakes and high quality riparian habitat. We offer recommendations to reduce the hazard levels currently found at PHX and to reduce additional hazards as the habitat around PHX is converted and produces more attractive wildlife habitat.

DE rollover; stratification; volcanic lakes; carbon dioxide
ID CAMEROON
AB Seemingly stably stratified fluids, that is a heavier layer of fluid underlying an upper layer of lighter fluid, can overturn if there is a heat flux through the system. Such events are termed "rollover" in the engineering literature (occurring for instance in liquid natural gas tanks). They take place as well in lakes and ponds. In all such cases, the stratification starts off with the heavier, more dense fluid underlying lighter. Convection driven mixing at the stratification interface (due to the heat flux) as well as other processes serves to minimize with time the stabilizing density differences, which may eventually cause the stratification to invert. If gas has been contained under pressure in the lower layer, this gas may explosively Vent from the fluid as it suddenly rises to the top such as occurs in liquid natural gas tanks where rollover is a hazard. These processes are quantifiable and are applied here to various scenarios that might refer to volcanic crater lakes whose lower layers are charged with volatiles. Provided herein are some examples of calculated conditions and calculated time of evolution leading to rollover with attendant release of gases from supersaturated ascending fluids. These calculations suggest rollover could occur in volcanic lakes. The August 1986 gas release at Lake Nyos is employed as an example. These estimates were made taking note that water is commonly supersaturated in CO2 (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A geochemical survey carried out in November 1993 revealed that Lake Quilotoa was composed by a thin (similar to 14 m) oxic epilimnion overlying a similar to 200 m-thick anoxic hypolimnion. Dissolved CO2 concentrations reached 1000 mg/kg in the lower stratum. Loss of CO2 from epilimnetic waters, followed by calcite precipitation and a consequent lowering in density, was the apparent cause of the stratification.
   The Cl, SO4 and HCO3 contents of Lake Quilotoa are intermediate between those of acid-SO4-Cl Crater lakes and those of neutral-HCO3 Crater lakes, indicating that Lake Quilotoa has a 'memory' of the inflow and absorption of HCl- and S-bearing volcanic (magmatic) gases. The Mg/Ca ratios of the lake waters are governed by dissolution of local volcanic rocks or magmas, but K/Na ratios were likely modified by precipitation of alunite, a typical mineral in acid-SO4-Cl Crater lakes.
   The constant concentrations of several conservative chemical species from lake surface to lake bottom suggest that physical, chemical and biological processes did not have enough time, after the last overturn, to cause significant changes in the contents of these chemical species. This lapse of time might be relatively large, but it cannot be established on the basis of available data. Besides, the lake may not be close to steady state. Mixing of Lake Quilotoa waters could presently be triggered by either cooling epilimnetic waters by similar to 4 degrees C or providing heat to hypolimnetic waters or by seismic activity.
   Although Quilotoa lake contains a huge amount of dissolved CO2 (similar to 3 x 10(11) g), at present the risk of a dangerous limnic eruption seems to be nil even though some gas exsolution might occur if deep lake waters were brought to the surface. Carbon dioxide could build up to higher levels in deep waters than at present without any volcanic re-awakening, due to either a large inflow of relatively cool CO2-rich gases, or possibly a long interval between overturns. Periodical geochemical surveys of Lake Quilotoa are, therefore, recommended. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The prognostic value of the type of anaesthesia used for the excision of malignant tumours has been a subject of controversy. Cell mediated as well as humoural immune responses can be compromised after general anaesthesia, and recurrences may therefore occur more frequently. On the other hand, excision of primary tumours under local anaesthesia might also influence the prognosis unfavourably. The aim of the present study was to determine the prognostic impact of general and local anaesthesia for the primary excision of cutaneous melanoma. Follow-up data of 4329 patients on the Central Melanoma Registry of the German Dermatological Society were analysed. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to evaluate the independent significance of the prognostic factors, and survival probabilities were calculated for matched pairs using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Statistical analysis revealed an independent significant effect on survival for tumour thickness, ulceration, level of invasion, anatomical site and gender. General anaesthesia for primary excision of melanoma was associated with a decrease in the survival rate (relative risk 1.46, P < 0.0001). This study revealed a slight but significantly increased risk of death for patients treated with general anaesthesia for the primary excision of melanoma. Therefore local anaesthesia should be preferred for the treatment of primary melanoma. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

For some objects makings predictable future close approaches to the Earth, orbital uncertainties may be such that a collision with the Earth cannot be ruled out. Careful and responsible communication between astronomers and the public is required for reporting these predictions and a 0.10 point hazard scale, reported inseparably with the date of close encounter, is recommended as a simple and efficient tool for this purpose. The goal of this scale, endorsed as the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, is to place into context the level of public concern that is warranted for any close encounter event within the next century. Concomitant reporting of the close encounter date further conveys the sense of urgency that is warranted. The Torino Scale value for a close approach event is based upon both collision probability and the estimated kinetic energy (collision consequence), where the scale value can change as probability and energy estimates are refined by further data. On the scale, Category 1 corresponds to collision probabilities that are comparable to the current annual chance for any given size impactor. Categories 8-10 correspond to certain (probability >99%) collisions having increasingly dire consequences. While close approaches falling Category 0 may be no cause for noteworthy public concern, there remains a professional responsibility to further refine orbital parameters for such objects and a figure of merit is suggested for evaluating such objects. Because impact predictions represent a multi-dimensional problem, there is no unique or perfect translation into a one-dimensional system such as the Torino Scale. These limitations are discussed.

AB Introduction. Cataract is a major cause of visual disturbance after transplantation. Although corticosteroid therapy has been linked with posterior subcapsular cataract, its natural history in the cyclosporine era is not well understood.
   Methods, Baseline and regular postoperative slit-lamp biomicroscopy and ophthalmic examinations (n=432) were performed in 108 eyes of simultaneous kidney/pancreas (SPK) recipients (n=54) for up to 10 years after transplantation. Triple therapy immunosuppression of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone was used,
   Results. Cataract was present in 40% of eyes at simultaneous kidney/pancreas associated with duration of diabetes, lower insulin dose, and the use of pretransplant hemodialysis (P<0.05-0.01). Cataract became increasing more common 2 years after simultaneous kidney/pancreas, and lens abnormalities were virtually universal at 6-10 years by slit lamp biomicrosopy, The instantaneous hazard rate for new cataract formation was highest within the first 2 years and remained abnormal for the study duration. Nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract increased significantly after transplantation (P<0.05) and were the predominant types of cataract presenting late. Risk factors for posttransplant cataract formation included older age and high-dose pulse methylprednisolone dose. Visual acuity was reduced by severity of cataract grade, presence of combined nuclear and subcapsular cataract, retinal hemorrhage and underlying diabetic retinopathy (P<0.05-0.001). Cataract formation imposed significant additional impairment of visual acuity above that of diabetic retinopathy, Cataract surgery was undertaken in 14% of eyes, improving visual acuity from mean decimalized score of 0.28 to 0.43, P<0.01 but did not normalize it to the noncataract level of 0.72.
   Conclusion. Transplantation substantially increases all types of cataract, and is highly prevalent by slit lamp examination. High-risk patients are older and diabetic, and received hemodialysis and pulse corticosteroid therapy. In contrast to older studies using high-dose corticosteroid and azathioprine, the pattern of cataract in the cyclosporine era is different with broader cataract types, a weaker association with corticosteroids and a progressive course. Regular screening of visual acuity and appropriate surgery for posterior subcapsular or severe cataract are recommended.

AB Hydrocarbon vapors associated with spilled petroleum products arouse regulatory concern and can pose a significant health and safety risk. While petroleum products do not contain a significant amount of methane (CH4), high CH4 contents in soil gas near petroleum spills have been reported. While CH4 is nontoxic, its accumulation in shallow soil gas represents a potential explosion and asphyxiation hazard, especially in confined spaces. Identifying the source and origin of shallow CH4 accumulations is an important part of evaluating potential exposure pathways, selecting appropriate remedial measures, and determining environmental liability. This paper discusses the potential nature and anthropogenic sources for shallow CH4 and how integration of geological, geochemical, and land use data can be used to determine its origin and identify its source. Two case studies are presented, one where CH4 associated with a gasoline spill is shown to be derived from a natural source rather than the gasoline, and a second where CH4 associated with spilled crude oil is shown to be produced in the vadose zone by biodegradation of the oil.

AB Global climate change is likely to have a range of consequences for human health as a result of disturbance or weakening of the biosphere's natural or human-managed Life support systems. The full range of potential human health impacts of global climate change is diverse and would be distributed differentially spatially and over time. Changes in the mortality toll of heatwaves and changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases may occur early. The public health consequences of sea level rise and of regional changes in agricultural productivity may not occur (or become apparent) for several decades. Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the ability to adapt in anticipation of, or in response to, its impacts. The basic modes of adaptation to climate-induced health hazards are biological, behavioural and social. Adaptation can be undertaken at the individual, community and whole-population levels. Adaptive strategies should not introduce new health hazards. Enhancement of the acknowledged public health infrastructure and intervention programmes is essential to reduce vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. In the longer-term, fundamental improvements in the social and material conditions of life and in the reduction of inequalities within and between populations are required for sustained reduction in vulnerability to environmental health hazards.

AB Natural gas from gas fields around the globe often contains mercury, along with a large number of other harmful substances (CO2, H2S, RSH, COS, etc). Mercury's potentially harmful effect on humans and on the ecological system as a whole as well as the technological risk regarding very sophisticated and expensive process equipment and catalysts make its removal imperative. There is a need for the highest efficiency for mercury removal and for permanent improvement and enhancement of technological and control procedures, including analytical instruments and measurements.
   Mercury concentration measurements in the ambient air performed during natural gas processing confirm that the design of the system at the Molve gas plant is adequate to meet the mercury removal objectives. The obtained results also illustrate in an excellent way the use of the portable instrument to identify and prevent potential mercury generated hazards linked to specific industrial processes.

AB Interplanetary space radiation poses a serious health hazard in long-term manned space missions. Natural Martian surface materials are evaluated for their potential use as radiation shields for manned Mars missions. The modified radiation fluences behind various kinds of Martian rocks and regolith are determined by solving the Boltzmann equation using NASA Langley's HZETRN code along with the 1977 Solar Minimum galactic cosmic ray environmental model. To make structural shielding composite materials from constituents of the Martian atmosphere and from Martian regolith for Martian surface habitats, schemes for synthesizing polyimide from the Martian atmosphere and for processing Martian regolith/polyimide composites are proposed. Theoretical predictions of the shielding properties of these composites are computed to assess their shielding effectiveness. Adding high-performance polymer binders to Martian regolith to enhance the structural properties also enhances the shielding properties of these composites because of the added hydrogenous constituents. Laboratory testing of regolith simulant/polyimide composites is planned in order to validate this prediction and also to measure various structural properties.

AB The geochemical abundance of phosphorus belies its importance as phosphate to life forms. As we explore the roles of microorganisms anti humans in biogeochemical cycles. We are also enhancing our understandings of the phosphate control and the continuum that to biomineralogist begins and ends in apatite. Well-crystallized apatite is utilized in geochemical studies for dating geologic events, and apatitic materials, such as marine phosphate deposits, contribute to the construction of the global phosphate cycle. the apatitic mineral in bones and teeth is a reservoir of information on diet, climate, and the environment. A unique group of samples that integrate biogeochemical information, the detailed chemical investigations of teeth and bone, are now utilized to investigate geochemical events and environments. but they also are sources of information in medical diagnosis and treatment. As we question the mechanisms of disease induction and hazards, both natural and anthropologically created or induced on a global scale over time, the recorded is being preserved in apatitic mineralized tissues.

AB A modification to ASTM F 1671-97a, Test Method for Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Blood-Borne Pathogens Using Phi-X174 Bacteriophage Penetration as a Test System, was developed to allow evaluation of elastomeric materials having small tears. The original method provides for a flat, open-mesh support screen to prevent expansion of such materials. While natural latex rubber specimens with open, laser-drilled holes (greater than or equal to 1 mu m) fail this test by allowing virus penetration , nitrile-butadiene rubber specimens with small tears (20 to 45 pm) pass. A stainless steel wire cloth support screen with a hemispherical-like dome, in lieu of the flat screen, provided controlled expansion and allowed detection of defective specimens with tears. The data also suggest a similar modification to enhance ASTM F 1670-97, Test Method for Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing to Penetration by Synthetic Blood.

ID GROWTH MANAGEMENT; FLORIDA
AB During the early 1980s, many developers used savings-and-loan (S&L) institutions to underwrite their financial risks. The Economic Recovery Act, the centerpiece of President Ronald Reagan's economic recovery plan, exacerbated the situation by increasing the tax benefits of real estate investment no matter how sound they were. The result was hyperspeculation by the development industry, leading to more than $80 billion dollars in direct taxpayer-subsidized "bailouts" of overextended S&Ls, with a total cost to the economy approaching a half trillion dollars. The S&L bailout is considered the nation's worst taxpayer-financed disaster, including natural disasters. Is there anything planning intervention could have done to prevent or minimize those losses? Natural hazard risk reduction literature is;is used herein to develop a theory of the role of environmental impact assessment and growth management planning regimes that include needs-assessment components in minimizing losses of financial institutions through overbuilding. An empirical model demonstrates a significant statistical relationship between such regimes and S&L losses among states. Policy implications are offered.

DE unemployment duration; semiparametric hazard model; natural experiment
ID REEMPLOYMENT; BENEFITS; SWEDEN; IMPACT; MODELS
AB This paper uses data from a natural experiment to investigate the potential incentive effect of a fixed unemployment insurance period. We compare two large groups of Norwegian unemployed persons who registered as unemployed in 1990 and 1991. The last group was affected by a rule change that in practice extended the length of unemployment benefits to more than 3 years. Our data are taken from official records, and we construct unemployment durations by combining information from the unemployment registers with employers' records. We use a proportional hazard model with a flexible baseline. The results suggest that the main effect of benefits running out is to make people drop out of the unemployment register. We find neither clear evidence that the hazard into employment increased when the end of benefits approached in the pre-liberalisation group, nor that behaviour in this part of the spells changed after the reform. On the other hand, our results suggest that the reform had an all over negative effect on the employment hazard. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. JEL classification: J64: C41.

AB Flood disasters account for about a third of all natural disasters throughout the world (by number and economic losses) and are responsible for more than half of the fatalities. Trend analyses reveal that major flood disasters and the losses generated by them have increased drastically in recent years. Go-operation between the state, the affected population and the insurance industry assumes a key role with regard to the flood hazard. Scientists, engineers and insurers must work together in formulating their requirements and shaping them in such a way that politicians can derive clearly recognizable policy options (e.g. land use restrictions) from them. Another important aspect is stepping up the efforts being made towards curbing climate change, which will otherwise exacerbate the risk in the future.

AB A "quasi continuous mode" monitoring system to measure the radon concentration within a natural environment (mainly groundwater), was designed, assembled and tested, under collaboration between DINCE and ING, partly within the framework of two EC funded programs.
   The radon monitor consists of a customised discrete automatic sampler which produces a gas flux circuit, and an economical a-scintillation cell, coupled with a reliable electronics-photomultiplier assemblage. A convenient calibration system together with a temporised control system have been set up. The overall "mean efficiency" of the system was calculated to be 7.79 +/- 0.13 counts per minute (cpm) for each Bq/L.
   Taking into consideration the present and future requirements of a geochemical surveillance network to assess natural hazards, the prototype design evolved from the study of existing systems devoted to monitor radon concentration levels, which are critically reviewed within this paper.
   In response to the main prerequisite of a remote station: maximum remote sensor versatility preserving shared software and hardware for the network as a whole, this radon monitoring system was conceived as part of a multi-parametric Geochemical Monitoring System (GMS II) prototype, designed and realised as a test-stand for sensors (chemical, hydrological, geophysical, organic chemistry devoted, etc.) in continuous evolution throughout the international market.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the cytokeratin tumor marker tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) in patients with vulvar cancer. This retrospective study comprises 41 patients with vulvar cancer FIGO stages I-III, 17 patients with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) III, and 40 healthy female controls. Serum concentrations of TPA were measured using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. Results were correlated to clinical data. Median serum concentrations of TPA in healthy female controls, patients with VIN ill, and patients with vulvar cancer were 42 U/I (range 12-192), 53 U/I (range 17-127.9) and 57 U/I (range 4.2-423), respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.8). Serum concentrations of TPA were not associated with stage of disease, histological grade, and age at the time of diagnosis. In vulvar cancer patients, elevated serum concentrations of TPA prior to therapy were not associated with a shortened disease-free or overall survival (log-rank test: p = 0.5 and p = 0.9, respectively). In a multivariate Cox regression model comprising tumor stage and TPA, tumor stage, but not TPA revealed a statistically significant influence on disease-free (Cox proportional hazard regression model, p = 0.05 and p = 0.6, respectively) and overall (Cox proportional hazard regression model, p = 0.04 and p = 0.8, respectively) survival of patients with vulvar cancer. We conclude that cytokeratin expression, as reflected by serum concentrations of TPA, does not play a role in the natural history of vulvar cancer. The evaluation of serum concentrations of TPA prior to therapy is not recommended. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Background The concentration of T-cell receptor-rearrangement excision DNA circles (TREC) in peripheral-blood T cells is a marker of recent thymic emigrant ap T cells. We studied the predictive ability of measurements of TREC for clinical outcome in HIV-1-infected individuals.
   Methods We measured TREC in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells with a real-time PCR assay. We studied 131 Greek participants in the Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study who had known HIV-1 seroconversion dates. The prognostic value of baseline TREC, CD4 T-cell count, and HIV-1 RNA concentration was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox's regression analysis.
   Findings Four participants had progressed to AIDS by first blood sampling. Among the remaining 127 individuals, the median value of TREC per 10(6) cells was 6900 (IQR 2370-15 604). Baseline TREC values were lower in the 53 who progressed to AIDS than in those who did not (geometric mean 2843 [95% CI 1468-5504] vs 6560 [4723-9113] per 10(6) cells; p=0.017). The relative hazard of AIDS, adjusted for plasma viral load, CD4 T-cell count, and age at seroconversion was 1.44 (95% CI 1.04-2.01; p=0.031) per ten-fold increase in TREC; that for death was 1.52 (1.12-2.06; p=0.007). The adjusted relative hazards of death were 2.91 (1.91-4.44; p<0.001) per ten-fold increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA load and 1.20 (1.04-1.38; p=0.014) per 100-cell decrease in CD4 T-cell count.
   Interpretation The concentration of TREC in the peripheral T-cell pool complements HIV-1 RNA load and CD4 T-cell count in predicting the rate of HIV-1 disease progression. Recent thymic emigrants have a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease.

AB Conservative land-use over the past few decades has converted the Montseny Biosphere Reserve (Spain) from the original open, patchy landscape to almost continuous woodland. Small ruminant grazing is virtually the only major remaining utilisation activity yet little is known about its role in the changing vegetation of the Reserve. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of current grazing practice on its main vegetation components. Three flocks, composed of sheep and goats, that graze yearlong on three separate ranges in the Reserve were selected for study. The ranges represent the wooded slopes and the shrubby upland (altiplano) in the area. Biomass consumption by the flocks was estimated by calculation of normative requirements fur observed production and the botanical composition of the livestock diets over a whole annual cycle was determined by micro-histological analysis of the faeces. Production of herbaceous vegetation was determined by clipping sample quadrats, the production of the woody vegetation was derived from previous work in the Reserve. It was found that grazing removed a very small proportion of the dominant Helm oak (Quercus ilex) on the slopes, and a moderate fraction of the shrubby and herbaceous vegetation on the altiplano. Only the heath tree (Erica arborea), an edible shrub in the woodlands, was relatively heavily grazed. It is concluded that grazing alone is not enough to maintain the open, diverse landscape with its many natural values. As in other northern Mediterranean countries, under-utilisation of these woodlands is becoming a serious problem that is also increasing the fire hazard. Maintaining landscape diversity in the region is a complex challenge that land managers should recognise. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A great deal of attention has been focused on the antitumor effects of anti-MUC1 humoral and cellular responses. We examined whether anti-MUC1 antibody is present in patients with lung cancer, and evaluated its prognostic value. Serum was obtained from 30 patients with nonresectable, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 60 healthy volunteers. The presence of anti-MUC1 antibody was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The patients were observed for a median follow-up time of 54.0 mo. Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Anti-KL-6/MUC1 antibody levels of the patients were significantly lower than those of normal individuals (p < 0.001). One-year survival rate of patients with high concentrations of anti-KL-6/MUC1 antibody was significantly higher than that of patients with low levels of anti-KL-6/MUC1 antibody (90.9% versus 21.1%, p < 0.001). Anti-KL-6/MUC1 antibody status was most strongly correlated with mortality, followed by lymph node status and albumin levels, whereas sex, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and metastasis status did not correlate with mortality. These preliminary results indicate that the degree of decrease in antibody level may be associated with a patient's prognosis.

AB Periodic low-intensity fire (hazard-reduction burning) is a conspicuous management strategy in virtually all of Australia's dry forest communities where it is primarily used to reduce fuel levels with the intention of minimising the extent and severity of wildfires. Little is known, however, about the effects of its repeated use on natural ecosystems over long periods of time. This study investigated the long-term effects of frequent low-intensity fire on forest ant communities by comparing frequently burnt sites with long-unburnt control sites. While the richness of ant communities remained largely unchanged, the composition of assemblages differed substantially between treatments. Although frequent burning apparently resulted in the loss of a substantial number of species, the overall richness of frequently burnt areas was maintained by the addition of species not present on unburnt sites. These changes in species composition were accompanied by major changes in community organisation (structure) and were considered to be a response to altered habitat conditions, particularly litter biomass, vegetation structure and patterns of insolation at ground level. Appropriate fire prescriptions could therefore be applied to manipulate these habitat elements at a landscape scale to meet both management and conservation goals. A comparison of pitfall trapping and litter extraction techniques revealed the importance of a composite sampling strategy, with 22% of ant species detected only by litter extraction.

TI Apparent breaks in scaling in the earthquake cumulative
   frequency-magnitude distribution: Fact or artifact?
SO BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

   TECTONICS; PRINCIPLE; MOMENT
AB It has been suggested that the finite width of the seismogenic lithosphere can have a strong effect on the frequency-moment relation for large earthquakes. Theories have been proposed in which large earthquakes have either a shallower or a steeper power-law slope in the incremental frequency-moment distribution, at characteristic seismic moments corresponding to earthquakes that rupture the entire seismogenic depth. However, many authors have applied the predicted double-slope distribution, which requires five independent parameters, to cumulative frequency data, and used the location of the break of slope to make inferences on characteristic size effects in the earthquake source in different seismotectonic regions. Here we examine the problem in a forward modeling mode by adding a realistic degree of statistical scatter to ideal incremental frequency-moment distributions of various commonly used forms. Adopting a priori the assumption of a piecewise linear distribution, we find in each case apparently statistically distinct breaks of slope that are not present in the parent distribution. These breaks of slope are artifacts produced by a combination of (a) high-frequency noise introduced by the random statistical scatter, (b) the more gradual natural roll-over in the cumulative frequency data near the maximum seismic moment, and (c) a systematic increase in the apparent regression coefficient due to the natural smoothing effect of the use of cumulative-frequency data. Therefore, if there is no apparent break of slope in the incremental distribution, it is unwise to interpret the cumulative-frequency data uniquely in terms of a break in slope. Until such breaks of slope can be distinguished in incremental-frequency data, we conclude that alternative methods (inversion of fault length and width from individual source mechanisms/aftershock sequences etc.) should be preferred for the examination of finite-depth effects, and that simpler solutions to the frequency-moment problem should be adopted for seismic-hazard applications.

AB BACKGROUND, Natural killer (NK) cells are a group of effector cells that act nonspecifically against tumor cells. The correlation between intratumoral NK cell infiltration and clinicopathologic features remains unclear.
   METHODS. The authors selected 146 patients with gastric carcinoma who underwent gastrectomy at Kagoshima University Hospital between 1985-1995. Immunohistochemical staining with the CD57 antibody was performed for the evaluation of NK cell infiltration. A total of 25 areas containing CD57 positive cells were selected and the number of NK cells were counted (magnification, x200). The patients were divided into 2 groups: patients with a high level of NK infiltration (n = 39) (>25 NK cells/25 high-power fields [HPF]) and patients with a low level of NK infiltration (n = 107) (<25 NK cells/25 HPF). Intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration also was counted in 25 areas at a magnification of x200. Patients were classified into a high infiltrating lymphocyte (IL) group (n = 69) (>150 cells/HPF) and a low IL group (n = 77) (<150 cells/HPF). The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to analyze surgical outcome. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors.
   RESULTS, Patients with a high level of NK infiltration had a higher rate of early gastric carcinoma, fewer metastases to the lymph nodes (P < 0.01), and less lymphatic invasion (P < 0.05) than patients with a low level of NK infiltration. NK cell infiltration also was found to correlate with depth of invasion, clinical stage, and venous invasion. There was no correlation between NK cells and lymphocytic infiltration (P = 0.07; correlation coefficient = 0.15). The 5-year survival rate of patients with a high rate of NK infiltration was 78%, which was significantly better than that of patients with a low level of NR infiltration (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did nor show NK cell infiltration to be a significant prognostic factor. Combination analysis of the number of NK cells and lymphocytic infiltration was shown to be an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.02; hazard ratio = 1.32).
   CONCLUSIONS, Patients with a high level of NK infiltration were found to have a better prognosis than those with a low level of NK infiltration. Combination analysis with lymphocytic infiltration may provide useful information regarding the immunologic condition of patients with gastric carcinoma. (C) 2000 American Cancer Society.

AB BACKGROUND, Thickness is known to be an important survival prognosticator for cutaneous melanoma, but controversy exists as to whether Clark level of invasion retains prognostic significance once thickness has been accounted for. A recent proposal to eliminate Clark level from the staging system for melanoma of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) prompted the authors to investigate whether level adds useful prognostic information to Breslow thickness. They used the data base of the New York University Melanoma Cooperative Group (NYUMCG) Registry.
   METHODS. The analysis was based on 919 patients with AJCC Stage I or II melanomas diagnosed between 1972 and 1982 and followed for an average of 10.9 years. Melanoma thicknesses were divided into 4 categories (less than or equal to 0.75, 0.76-1.50, 1.51-4.00, and >4.00 mm), Patients were cross-classified according to tumor thickness and Clark level (II-V). For each combination of thickness and level, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and 10-year survival proportion were computed, using death from melanoma as the outcome. The impact of Clark level on survival was evaluated for each of the thickness categories. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the simultaneous effect of thickness and level on survival while controlling for other important prognostic factors, i.e., age, tumor location, and presence or absence of ulceration.
   RESULTS. Level of invasion was a significant predictor of death from melanoma in each of the four thickness categories. Likewise, in the Cox analyses, level was a significant prognostic variable, even after thickness was included in the model and regardless of whether thickness was treated as a categoric or a continuous variable.
   CONCLUSIONS. These results confirm that both tumor thickness and level of invasion are important independent prognostic factors in AJCC Stage I and II melanomas. The authors recommend that Clark levels be kept as criteria in the AJCC staging system and be included in pathology reports.

AB Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are quite common in the South African mining and mineral processing industry, even so that uranium is produced as a by-product at certain gold mines. Other major industries associated with NORMs are the coal, copper and heavy mineral sectors. Legislation in South Africa addresses the allowed yearly radiation dose to registered radiation workers and the general public, and adheres to the most common internationally accepted standards of 20 mSv/a and 1 mSv/a, respectively, for these categories. The yearly dose is obviously the sum of the contributions from every individual nuclide from all possible sources. Accordingly, for members of the public, the individual sources are to be evaluated at the (Youth African) guideline level of 25 mu Sv/a. This imposes severe constraints on the radioanalytical laboratory to offer an affordable routine service due to the required sensitivity to analyse these NORMs and the variety of matrices involved. Evaluation of the available radioanalytical infrastructure, the yearly intake and the generally accepted dose conversion factors allow the laboratory to provide proper service designs to enable meaningful radiological hazard evaluation.

AB An investigation was conducted to assess the impact of cleaning of natural drains from heavy infestation of predominant aquatic weed Ipomoea carnea at Baikhedi village of Tawa Command. Among various control measures, 1 spray of 2,4-D EE @ 22 kg ai/ha in March/April followed by manual cleaning and burning of dried stubble was found suitable with weed control efficiency as 82.5%. This measure has benefitted the drainage area in various ways. It controlled the water table by 24 cm. The number of occurrence of shallow water table conditions reduced by 20%. The time tin days) required for the field to become workable after pre-sowing irrigation reduced by 3, 3, 6 and 10 days under excellent, good, fair and poor drainage condition respectively The average increase in yield of 'lok 1' wheat was observed around 16 to 20% compared to yield levels obtained prior to cleaning operation. The initial cost of cleaning was around Rs 2 716/km for 10 tn wide section of the drain. The cost of cleaning of resprouted weed in the subsequent 2 years came around 11% and 9% of the Initial cost respectively. Adoption of this measure generated 778-man-days employment to villagers. Cleaning of poorly funtional natural drains from infestation of Ipomoea carnea weed maintains good flow of excess water which in turn reduces waterlogging hazards and improves the productivity as well as workability of the area.

TI Site investigation - the maximization of data

DE management; site investigation
AB In most instances, contaminated land management conjures up in people's minds varying degrees of remediation practices. These may vary from dig and dump, in situ or ex situ processes, volume reduction, containment, or even natural attenuation. The key word, however, is 'management', in that, while a site may exhibit contamination, it may not necessarily pose a hazard. It is only through conducting a site investigation and possibly a risk assessment that the hazard and associated risk can be determined. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), 'the primary aim of radiological protection is to provide an appropriate standard of protection for man without unduly limiting the beneficial practices giving rise to radiation exposure'. Of equal importance is the general ICRP definition of intervention as 'an activity that decreases overall exposure by removing existing sources, modifying pathways, or reducing the number of exposed individuals'. Interpreting these definitions is key to the provision of safe and effective management of contaminated land. Site investigation is therefore the tool through which the supporting and underpinning information is derived. Invariably, it is an expensive exercise and, if not carefully designed, has the potential to involuntary mobilize contamination or even cross-contaminate geological strata.
   An investigation therefore needs clearly to address the overall objectives and must be designed first and foremost with this in mind. The importance of the desk study phase in collating existing information prior to design is often underestimated and requires special attention. Of equal importance is the necessity to ensure that the site investigation process does nor neglect human safety or environmental protection. While it is possible to maintain an overall generic approach, it is important carefully to target known drivers and objectives. An investigation may be used to support any of the following, and most, if not all, are inextricably linked:
   (a) optioneering studies
   (b) delicensing part or all of a site
   (c) decommissioning work
   (d) to provide time-series data
   (e) to gain a quick appraisal of the problem
   (f) to prove safe management of the site
   (g) to underpin a risk assessment
   (h) to fulfil regulatory requirements
   (i) to undertake remediation.
   While a number of these issues will be discussed, the paper will concentrate primarily on the maximization of data arising from geotechnical investigations. On nuclear licensed sites, the majority of site investigation work is targeted at civil engineering projects, where geotechnical information is the primary aim. This data is invariably of limited use for contaminated land appraisal and it is therefore important to design a dual or multi-purpose site investigation of these additional requirements are to be met. Such an approach allows the follwoing:
   (a) maximization of the potential data set
   (b) alleviation of the requirement of re-drilling or sampling at a later date
   (c) the collection of time-series data
   (d) increased environmental protection
   (e) reduced costs over the long term.
   BNFL is currently undertaking a number of pilot investigations whereby geotechnical and environmental aspirations are being merged. It is hoped that through this process an increased understanding of environmental aspects of our sites can be established, thus allowing safe and effective management to take place.

AB Investigations leading to understanding and development of solid state rechargeable magnesium batteries are important in view of the fact that the Mg is free from hazards, it's stability is high and it's natural resources are abundant. A Mg2+ ion conducting gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is investigated for a possible application in solid stale rechargeable Mg battery. The GPE consists of polyacrylonitrile, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate and magnesium trifluoromethane sulfonate (magnesium triflate). The composition is optimized in view of the minimum liquid constituents required for the gel formation and the maximum specific conductivity (sigma). The cr of the GPE follows Arrhenius behavior and the energy of activation for ionic conduction is in the range between 0.13 and 0.16 eV. The a.c, impedance data of Mg/GPE/Mg symmetrical cells are analyzed by fitting the data to an equivalent circuit. The values of interfacial resistance (R-i) of the Mg/GPE, which is contributed by surface film resistance (R-f) on the Mg and charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) of the electrochemical reaction are evaluated. The Ri decreases with an increase of cell temperature. On the other hand, it increases with the ageing lime of the cell at ambient temperature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a general class of prior distributions for arbitrary regression models. We discuss parametric and semiparametric models. The prior specification for the regression coefficients focuses on observable quantities in that the elicitation is based on the availability of historical data D-0 and a scalar quantity a(0) quantifying the uncertainty in D-0. Then D-0 and a(0) are used to specify a prior for the regression coefficients in a semiautomatic fashion. The most natural specification of D-0 arises when the raw data from a similar previous study are available. The availability of historical data is quite common in clinical trials, carcinogenicity studies, and environmental studies, where large data bases are available from similar previous studies. Although the methodology we present here is quite general, we will focus only on using historical data from similar previous studies to construct the prior distributions. The prior distributions are based on the idea of raising the likelihood function of the historical data to the power a(0), where 0 less than or equal to a(0) less than or equal to 1. We call such prior distributions power prior distributions. We examine the power prior for four commonly used classes of regression models. These include generalized Linear models, generalized linear mixed models, semiparametric proportional hazards models, and cure rate models for survival data. For these classes of models, me discuss the construction of the power prior, prior elicitation issues, propriety conditions, model selection, and several other properties. For each class of models, we present real data sets to demonstrate the proposed methodology.

AB The microcystin cyanobacterial hepatotoxins represent an increasingly severe global health hazard. Sines microcystins are found world wide in drinking water reservoirs concern about the impact on human health has prompted investigations into remedial water treatment methods. This preliminary study investigates the scavenging from water of microcystin-LR by fine-grained particles known to have a high concentration of the clay minerals kaolinite and montmorillonite. The results show that more than 81% of microcystin-LR can be removed from water by clay material. Thus, microcystin-LR is indeed scavenged from water bodies by fine-grained particles and that this property may offer an effective method of stripping these toxins from drinking water supplies.

AB Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare tumor associated with a commonly poor prognosis. However, data on the natural history and response to therapy of patients with this malignancy have often been conflicting. Our objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical course and survival of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma and to identify relevant prognostic factors. Between 1966 and 1996, 31 patients with histologically documented adrenocortical carcinoma were observed at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center. Patient information was obtained from chart review. At the time of diagnosis, 48 per cent of patients had endocrine symptoms with compatible hormonal studies,19 per cent had involvement of the inferior vena cava by tumor thrombus, and 32 per cent had metastatic disease. The median survival time was 17 months (range, 1-205 months) for the entire group, and the 5-year survival rate was 26 per cent. Age <54 years, absence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and completeness of surgical resection were associated with better prognosis. Evaluation of survival with the Cox proportional hazards model suggested that age <54 years, absence of metastatic disease, and nonfunctioning tumor status were independently associated with improved survival. The prognosis of patients with adrenocortical carcinoma is poor but appears more favorable in patients <54 years, with localized disease, or nonfunctioning tumor status. Complete tumor resection may be associated with improved survival.

AB Mysids are used routinely by regulatory authorities for conducting 96 h LC50 toxicity tests to evaluate the potential hazards of pollutants to aquatic ecosystems. Data from these acute tests suggest that the European estuarine mysid Neomysis integer (Peracarida: Mysidacea) is comparatively sensitive to trace metals and organophosphate pesticides, and may be a suitable alternative to the frequently-used sub-tropical American mysid Americamysis (= Mysidopsis) bahia for testing the toxicity of chemical contaminants to European estuarine biota. There is, however, growing demand for the development of toxicity tests which are more representative of the effects of toxic contaminants on natural populations, and which provide results that are more readily extrapolated to natural ecosystems, than acute tests. Behavioural disruption, particularly of swimming ability, is used increasingly in laboratory toxicity studies as a sensitive endpoint for assessing the effects of contaminants on aquatic biota. This paper describes a sensitive laboratory technique, using an annular flume, to determine the effects of an organophosphate pesticide on the swimming behaviour of N. integer. Following 7-day exposure to 0.038 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1), mysids became hyperactive and more swam forward into a slow current (3 cm s(-1)) than control mysids. Despite this hyperactivity, pesticide-exposed mysids were unable to swim faster than 15 cm s(-1), whereas control mysids were able to swim faster than 18 cm s(-1). Other changes in swimming behaviour following pesticide exposure included fewer mysids maintaining position, and more mysids swimming with the current at high current velocities (18 cm s(-1)), than control individuals. These responses of chlorpyrifos-exposed N. integer are predicted to cause reduced ability of N. integer to maintain position in the natural estuarine habitat. Furthermore, the swimming behaviour of N. integer was affected at pesticide concentrations below the 7 day LC50 (0.084 mu g chlorpyrifos l(-1)), highlighting the importance of using sub-lethal toxicity studies for predicting environmental consequences of pollutant discharge.

   Indonesia's natural disaster
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID FOREST; KALIMANTAN
AB During the extended El Nino drought of 1997-8, fires devastated Indonesia's forests, creating a vast shroud of smoke that reached as far as mainland Southeast Asia. This article examines the interpretation of these fires - their causes, damages and solutions - by the Indonesian government, international donors, environmental activists and local farmers. It explores the contexts and consequences of these discourses of disaster, and specifically investigates the central role of remote technology - a 'hegemonic' representational tool, in some circumstances creatively appropriated to serve new democratic agendas. A narrow focus on remotely sensed data is not strictly a methodological but also a political choice, one which obscures alternative experiences of disaster and produces solutions that do not address long term social and political processes leading to the fires. What is missing from most current analyses of the fires, and from remote assessments in general, is a textured understanding of social landscapes and the role they play in creating fire hazards.

AB The purpose of this study is to apply digital city concept for the development of a pictogram system for natural disaster reduction. Long lasting and tangible achievement of IDNDR is needed which may be used in all over the world for many coming generations. As Neurath said "Words divide, pictures unite", pictograms could be a powerful communication tool as well as an educational tool to improve global disaster awareness. In this project, we formed a multi-disciplinary team to compile "A Database of Pictograms for Natural Disaster Reduction", which we intend to release our copyrights to be used widely and freely as an achievement of IDNDR through internet. We developed the lexicon and grammar of the pictograms for natural disaster reduction. Over 700 pictograms in use were collected for evaluation, and new designs were also added to complete the list of concepts related to natural hazards and their disaster management. Home page will be introduced for worldwide participation in this project as a first step towards the digital city for disaster reduction.

AB Researchers from The University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, and from the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI), Japan, have commenced a joint project to develop, deploy and test an innovative hardware/software system design for an automatic, continuously-operated ground deformation monitoring system based on low-cost GPS receiver technology. Conventional continuously-operated GPS (CCPS) networks, such as the one established in Japan by GSI to precisely measure earth surface movement, are very expensive. The high cost being primarily due to the fact that dual-frequency receivers are used. Japan's nationwide GEONET network is the world's largest, numbering nearly 1000 receiver stations, with an average station spacing of the order of 30 km. In order to densify such CGPS networks (important when high spatial resolution for the monitoring of the deformation phenomenon is required), and to promote the use of the CGPS technique in lesser developed countries, a significantly cheaper system architecture is needed. The proposed design is an integrated, dual-mode network consisting of low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers across the area of interest, surrounded by a sparser network of dual-frequency GPS receivers. Initial tests of data collected at selected stations in the GEONET network have already shown that through enhanced data processing algorithms a CGPS network containing both single-frequency and dual-frequency receivers would be able to deliver better than centimetre level accuracies, at considerably lower cost than present systems based exclusively on dual-frequency instrumentation. This paper reports the results of the first field test of this new CGPS system design, in the Tsukuba area of Japan, in August 1999. The test network consisted of: (a) several stations of the GEONET network surrounding (b) an inner network of four single-frequency Canadian Marconi GPS receivers installed by UNSW researchers. The data from both the GEONET and the UNSW receivers were processed using a specially modified version of the Bernese GPS Software Package. The software first processes the GEONET GPS station data in order to generate empirical corrections which are then applied to the double-differenced data of the GPS baselines located within the test area enclosed by the dual-frequency CGPS stations. These corrections have the effect of improving baseline solution accuracy by up to an order of magnitude, even for baselines ranging up to 100 km in length. The baselines connecting the inner network to the surrounding GEONET stations are processed in a number of modes, including 24 hr files (as is the standard practice for geodynamic applications) and hourly data files (as in volcano deformation monitoring applications). The results indicate that single-frequency-with-correction processing can achieve accuracies of better than 5 mm in the horizontal components and 3 cm in height, while the dual-frequency results can achieve accuracies better than 2 mm in the horizontal components and 6 mm in height. In the authors' opinion, for certain geodynamic applications there are no significant differences between the single-frequency-with-correction results and the dual-frequency results, especially for the horizontal components.

AB The Yorkshire drought of 1995 was the most extreme climate event faced by the English and Welsh water industry since its privatization in 1989. As an emblem of crisis in privatized water management, and as a potential signal of climate change, the 1995 drought hits motivated change in water regulation and management. In this paper I challenge conventional interpretations of the 1995 water supply crisis as a natural hazard or as a result of managerial ineptitude. Drought is conceptualized as the production of scarcity, an outcome of three interrelated practices: meteorological modeling, demand forecasting, and corporate restructuring and the regulatory "game." These practices are situated within an analysis of the context of;he regulatory implications of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. I explore the simultaneously natural, social, and discursive elements of water scarcity and situate them within an analysis of privatization as regulation, rather than deregulation. This analysis brings insights developed in debates over "real" regulation and regulation theory to bear on nature-society analysis, while extending this debate through theorizing regulation as, in part, a discursive practice. The ensuing rereading of drought challenges conventional interpretations of environmental crisis, raises questions about the implications of water industry privatization, and emphasizes the need to account for the role of the state and the intricacies of "real" regulation in analyses of resource management.

AB From an oil industry standpoint, methane hydrate is known as a major problem because it plugs casing and pipelines. From a media standpoint, hydrates provide an almost inexhaustible supply of articles concerning greenhouse effects, landslides, global warming and mysterious events such as the loss of aircraft in the "Bermuda Triangle". From a scientific standpoint, they provide much scope for academic research projects.
   Oceanic hydrates have been recovered in some of the thousands of ODP/Joides boreholes, from which a total of over 250 km of core have been taken. Unfortunately, hydrates dissociate when brought on deck, and few samples were preserved for further analysis. Most of the oceanic hydrates are reported to be of biogenic origin, except where they overlie petroleum reservoirs, as in the Caspian Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The hydrates in the cores are found mostly as dispersed grains or thin laminae. Massive pieces of hydrate, greater than 10cm thick, have been found only at three sites. Downhole logs are unreliable indicates of hydrates due to cave-ins, and in many instances the inferred presence of hydrates depends on indirect evidence, such as seismic reflectors (BSR) or chlorinity changes in pore waters.
   The oil industry requires much better evidence than this before attributing reserve status to a resource, yet in the case of hydrates, enormous deposits (such as recently declared in New Caledonia) are reported on the strength of no more than uncertain seismic information.
   The gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) occurs in oceanic sediments over the first few hundred meters below the seabed. In this zone, any methane from organic material, including any seepages from below, is converted into solid hydrate, and is locked in place in the sediments. The origin of the methane is poorly understood, with even its biogenic origin being challenged.
   Dissolved methane or free gas may precipitate at geological discontinuities such a faults, fractures and lithological boundaries, as well as at water salinity, temperature and pressure interfaces. In the past, the porosity in the GHSZ was thought to be dominantly filled by hydrate, thus providing a seal to gas, at and below the base of the stability zone. However, at the Blake Ridge, ODP Leg 164 found only minor porosity (maximum of about 5%) being filled by hydrate or gas. The recent Leg 172 in the same area failed to find any hydrate at all. A much higher concentration has been indicated in the Japan National Oil Company hydrate borehole in the Nankai Trough, although this is contradicted by other reports.
   The Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) seismic reflector is caused mainly by gas bubbles at the base of the stability zone, which accordingly cannot act as a seal because the porosity is more than 95% filled by water, with the size of the pores and the gas bubbles being further factors. This is one reason why the BSR reflector does not correspond with the hydrate zones, as had been assumed. Cascadia, off Oregon, is one of the best places to investigate hydrates, as they crop out on the seafloor whereas on the Blake Ridge the first 200 m lack hydrates.
   Prior to 1998, the resources of hydrates were often declared to be much greater than all known fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). Ginsburg (1998) disputed such claims on the grounds that the hydrates are not continuously distributed vertically or horizontally. Mole recently, the USGS (Course 14, AAPG 2000) has drastically reduced its past estimates to a level where it is now claimed that hydrate accumulations may only rival the known reserves of conventional gas. These dispersed hydrate deposits may be better compared with dispersed oil and gas in petroleum systems, which are very much larger than the amounts contained in commercial reservoirs.
   Many graphs on solubility of methane in water are computed from formulae, being rarely checked by experiments. Measurements in the laboratory seem to differ from field measurements in sediments. The solubility of methane in deep water is but poorly known, as few measurements have been taken, bur it seems to be about a hundred rimes higher than in near surface-water. Methane released in deep ware, is dissolved in water, even when a large amount of methane is released. It cannot accordingly be the cause of any hazards. But little is known about the fate of the deep dissolved methane in upwelling seawater currents.
   Methane hydrates are less dense than water when on the seafloor down to a certain depth, which is still unknown (2650 m for CO2 hydrate). So, extrusions of hydrate tend to float upwards, disappearing into the seawater. Log measurements in sediments report hydrates being denser than water, but direct measurements are lacking, and it would seem that such sediments are also subject to buoyancy pressure. Surficial pockmarks and mud volcanoes arise from gas expelled from overpressured, underconsolidated sediments - with or without hydrates being present.
   Progress in understanding oceanic hydrates has not advanced much over the last twenty years because of the poor quality of measurements in soft sediments (cores, samples and logs) and because of the lack of calibration of seismic against a known oceanic hydrate system.
   The chance of a viable production method being developed is slim because the oceanic hydrates are dispersed and occur in erratic patches. Only national oil companies in Japan and India are actively exploring for them.
   Future progress may come from the deepwater exploration being undertaken by the oil industry using better tools, but oceanic hydrates seem to be similar in some respects to metallic nodules or gold in seawater-too dispersed to ever prove economic in most places. It is well said that they are a fuel for the future and likely to remain so.

AB The recent increase in the incidence of deformities among natural frog populations has raised concern about the state of the environment and the possible impact of unidentified causative agents on the health of wildlife and human populations. An open workshop on Strategies for Assessing the Implications of Malformed Frogs for Environmental Health was convened on 4-5 December 1997 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The purpose of the workshop was to share information among a multidisciplinary group with scientific interest and responsibility for human and environmental health at the federal and state level. Discussions highlighted possible causes and recent findings directly related to frog deformities and provided insight into problems and strategies applicable to continuing investigation in several areas. Possible causes of the deformities were evaluated in terms of diagnostics performed on field amphibians, biologic mechanisms that can lead to the types of malformations observed, and parallel laboratory and field studies. Hydrogeochemistry must be more integrated into environmental toxicology because of the pivotal role of the aquatic environment and the importance of faces and transport relative to any potential exposure. There is no indication of whether there may be a human health factor associated with the deformities. However, the possibility that causal agents may be waterborne indicates a need to identify the relevant factors and establish the relationship between environmental and human health in terms of hazard assessment.

ID SUCCESSION
AB The potential for reestablishing dune habitat is investigated in municipalities in New Jersey, USA, where natural coastal landforms and biota have been eliminated or reduced in extent. Dunes are classified using width, relationship to natural and cultural features, and changes through time, and they are assessed for their value as naturally functioning landforms in developed municipalities. The relationship between size and longevity that exists under natural conditions is altered by human activity. Small dunes on privately owned lots can survive as long as larger dunes in natural areas that are located farther inland, and foredunes repaired using sand fences and earth-moving equipment can survive where they could not under natural conditions.
   Common beach management practices reduce the ecological values of coastal dunes. Mechanical beach cleaning eliminates incipient dunes, habitat for nesting birds. seed sources for pioneer dune colonizers and food for fauna, and artificially small, stabilized foredunes reduce the variability in microenvironments necessary for biodiversity. Recent initiatives for reducing coastal hazards, protecting nesting birds, and encouraging nature-based tourism provide incentive for the development of a restoration prog ram for beaches and dunes that is compatible with human use. Suggested changes in management practice include restricting or rerouting pedestrian traffic, altering beach-cleaning procedures, using symbolic fences to allow for aeolian transport while preventing trampling of dunes, and eliminating or severely restricting exotic species. Landforms will be more natural in function and appearance but will be more dynamic, smaller and in a different position from those in natural areas. Research needs are specified for ecological, geo morphological, and attitudinal studies to support and inform restoration planning.

AB Mural paintings and stone monuments are exposed to natural and man-made hazards for time spans sometimes longer than 10,000 years without total dt cay. On the other hand, a high percentage of the mineral physical heritage suffers severe damage and even total loss within a few decades. Several factors influence this general situation. The mural paintings of Lascaux and Altamira had been stabilized in a protective environment for millennia until they were re-exposed to severe environmental risks. Wall paintings and stone sculptures may remain unaltered for many years through: (1) stabilized and protective environments, (2) development of a protective patina (biofilm, minerals, organics) or, (3) more recent additional paint or mortar layers, which themselves are exposed to environmental hazard instead of the fresco underneath. Natural or artificial coverage, however, will invariably hinder evaluation acid appreciation of the object of art. Detrimental microorganisms often only sporadically interact with these precious paintings. Many microbes settling on and in mural paintings lire of a unusual metabolic type, namely poikilotrophic organisms. These poikilotrophs art capable of forming a biocoenosis on and in mural paintings, which may establish itself within a few months or years and then remains unchanged in a dormant or non-cultivable stale for many years, or even centuries. The same holds true for chemical and physical alterations brought about by microorganisms. After a damaging initiation period of growth, the microflora may turn into a biofilm, which continues to live at extremely low levels of metabolic activity. In this way, detrimental chemical, physical and biological activities may be screened or shielded off for a very long period of time. In order to understand these processes, we have studied poikilotroph sub-aerial biofilms of mural paintings and sculptures excavated after. long periods of dormancy. Several methods for the characterization of the physical properties of the colonies of fungi involved in colonization and deterioration of mural paintings and stone monuments are described. The fairy-tale of "The Sleeping Beauty" maybe an excellent metaphor for this phenomenon. The main issue, however, is to understand the physical or mechanical impact of the poikilotroph flora on the materials of the physical heritage studied. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE Japanese classification system; nuclear grade; prognostic value; renal
   cell carcinoma
ID LATE RECURRENCE; DNA CONTENT; CANCER
AB Background: The natural history and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma cannot be predicted. Based on the Japanese classification system, the value of nuclear grade were assessed as a possible prognostic factor for renal cell carcinomas.
   Methods: In this retrospective study of 116 patients with renal cell carcinoma, radical nephrectomy was performed. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional hazard model.
   Results: Distribution by stage and grade in the population of renal cell carcinomas was as follows: pT1 in 13 cases (11.3%), pT2 in 65 cases (56.5%), pT3 in 36 cases (31.3%) and pT3 in one case (0.9%) and grade 1, 28 (24.1%) grade 2, 69 (59.5%) and grade 3, 16 (13.8%). Three cases could not be determined because of pre-operative embolization of the renal cell carcinomas. Nuclear grade was correlated with stage (P=0.0002), the presence of perirenal fat involvement (P=0.003) and metastases (P=0.007). A significant difference in survival was found between grades 1 and 3 (P=0.0001) and grades 2 and 3 (P=0.0001), respectively. Survival was significantly correlated with sex (P=0.0125), tumor size (P=0.0001). the presence of lymph node metastasis (P=0.0001), renal vein involvement (P=0.0001), perirenal fat involvement (P=0.002) or distant metastasis (P=0.0001). The multivariate analysis showed that the occurrence of tumor grade (P=0.0006) or distant metastasis were independent prognostic values.
   Conclusion: The observations lead us to conclude that the nuclear grade according to the Japanese classification system appears to be of reliable prognostic value for renal cell carcinomas.

TI Effectiveness of hearing protection devices in the hazard reduction of
   noise from used tractors
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WORKPLACE
AB Old and worn agricultural tractors show typically high noise levels, due to the natural deterioration of the engine, the gearbox and other components of the machine (tyres, exhaust). Despite the limit of technical obsolescence of tractors being commonly fixed at 10 yr, a large number of older machines are still in use in Italy.
   The noise produced by 60 used old tractors, working in farms located in Northern Italy, was recorded with the aim of ascertaining to what extent the use of the hearing protection devices (HPD) could significantly reduce the noise perceived by the driver. The performance, in terms of noise reduction rating and single number rating of 40 earmuffs, 54 earplugs and 27 ear canal caps was examined. For every tractor, the use of all 121 HPDs was simulated, to determine both the best and the worst conditions.
   Considering the Occupational Safety Health Administration and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations for decreasing the laboratory noise reduction ratings (to take into account the "real-world" attenuation), it can be concluded that, on average, 10 dB(A) of attenuation can be achieved.
   As the average noise level found at the tractor driver's ear was about 87-88 dB(A), with a maximum of 101 dB(A), this means that using the HPDs the noise could be reduced to 77-78 dB(A), up to 90-91 dB(A). This may be considered a fairly good result, but it should be recognized that the effectiveness of HPDs may vary widely from worker to worker, depending on correct wearing and wearing time.

ID BUILDING-MATERIALS
AB Due to the widespread use of marble as a building/construction material, experimental measurements of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 activities in marble have been carried out using a NaI(TI) gamma-ray spectrometer with a matrix-inversion-based spectral stripping technique. The samples were collected from various geological formations in Pakistan. The IAEA reference RG-Set was used for calibration of the spectrometer. The photo-peaks at 1460.8, 1764.5 and 2614.6 keV due to K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232, respectively, were used for the corresponding activity measurements. For Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40, the measured activity concentrations have been found to lie in the specific ranges 4-63, 9-40 and 7-105 Bq kg(-1), respectively, which are towards the lower end of the range of measurements on various geological materials world wide. The radium equivalent activity ranged from 25 to 99 Bq kg(-1). Values of 0.19 and 0.26 were determined as the average external and internal hazard indices of the marble samples.

AB Studies have been carried out to determine the natural radioactivity in some building materials (bricks, tiles, marble and ceramics) and their associated radiation hazard. The radioactivity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 were measured using a gamma spectrometer with a Hp-Ge detector. The activities of U-238 and U-234 were measured using an alpha-spectrometer with a surface barrier detector after applying a radiochemical procedure. The U-234/U-238 isotopic ratios were calculated. The radium equivalent activities and the radiation hazard index associated with the natural radionuclides were calculated. A computer program was developed and applied to calculate the dose rate a person will receive from the walls of a room constructed from the studied building materials. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Using the closed-can technique, radon exhalation rate measurements have been carried out for shale and coal samples collected from various mines located in the Chakwal and Makarwal areas of Pakistan, For the two areas, the measured average values of the exhalation rates from shale are 1.45 +/- 0.13 and 0.67 +/- 0.25 Bq m(-2) h(-1) and for coal are 1.0 +/- 0.03 and 0.65 +/- 0.32 Bq m(-2) h(-1), respectively. These values are much lower than the measured exhalation rates from alum-shale-based Nordic concrete which has values in the 50-200 Bq m(-2) h(-1) range. The lower values of the measured exhalation rates from the shale and coal deposits in the Chakwal and Makarwal areas are indicative of their lower uranium contents and mine workers in these areas do not face any abnormal health hazard due to radon since the exhalation rates have been found to be on the low side.

AB Prolonged exposure to radon, the largest source (69%) of natural radioactivity, may cause lung cancer and bronchial tissue damage. So monitoring of radon at places of high radioactivity and in underground mines is important to assess the radiological hazards to occupational workers. For these reasons radon measurements were carried out in some coal mines of Baluchistan, Pakistan. The measurements were based upon passive detection of radon using CN-85 track detectors in Box Type Dosimeters. The radon concentration varied from 121 to 408 Bq m(-3) in the mines under study. The computed radon dose varied from 1.38 to 4.67 mSv yr(-1) with an average of 2.19 +/- 0.5 mSv yr(-1). These coal mines have been found to be safe from radon-related health hazards.

AB A follow-up study was performed to analyze the effects of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on morbidity and mortality in the adult population from a village in Japan found to have endemic levels of both HCV and human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), By use of the Cox proportional hazards model, rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Strong, significant effects of seropositivity for antibodies to HCV on self-reported incident liver disease (RR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9-6.4) and on death due to liver cancer (RR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.6-41.4) were observed, Dual infection with HCV and HTLV-I seemed to have a synergistic effect on incident liver disease (RR, 5.9) as well as on death from liver cancer (RR, 21.9). HCV infection also was positively, although not significantly, associated with reported incident diabetes. Our findings suggest that coinfection with HTLV-I may affect the course of HCV-associated disease.

AB The first step in preparing a disaster management plan for any chemical process industry (CPI) is to identify and mitigate the conditions that might cause them. In practice, such a plan should start early in the design phase of the chemical facility, and continue throughout its life. The objective is to prevent emergencies by eliminating hazards wherever possible. In-spite of the advances made in knowledge and technology, failure-free design and devices have remained elusive. Even the well designed and inherently safe chemical facility must prepare to control potentially hazardous events that are caused by human or mechanical failure, or by natural forces such as floods or earthquakes. The need for effective technological disaster management programs by chemical facilities and their neighbouring communities became painfully clear in the 1980s, a decade marred by tragic events linked to the manufacture and distribution of chemical products. Unfortunately, several events during this decade, though not on a scale to match the previous one, have nevertheless cast a heavy burden and responsibility on the management. The chemical industry has vigorously responded to these problems in a wide variety of ways. The CPI took actions to improve the reliability of their operations, drew up emergency plans in consultation with the neighbourhood and the regulating authorities and practise emergency exercises regularly to alleviate public fear. Manali Industries in Chennai (Madras) is an exemplary model in India. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial cells undergo lysis readily, when suspended in mild aqueous acids, and release the cellular proteins along with other biomolecules. Molecular masses of the protein biomarkers released in-situ from individual intact bacterial cells could be directly measured by mass spectrometry. Limited sample clean up may be required at times, prior to mass spectral analysis, to remove any ionizable impurities such as salts, buffers and deergents. The marker proteins specific for individual genus, species and strains were determined by the comparison of the biomarkers measured for several closely related organisms. Even though there is a probability of over 4000 cellular proteins expressed in any singlebacterial cell, only a small fraction of the projected marker proteins rue identified consistently during the process. This could be due to the variation in the ionization properties of the proteins ansi the limited energy available to prompt their ionization. Variation in the sample processing and culture conditions had little effect in the marker proteins observed during the process. This experimental procedure enables the distinction of gram positive as well as gram negative cellular pathogens and their corresponding nonpathogenic counterparts. The identity of few bacterial cells present in unknown samples can be easily, rapidly and accurately established by adopting a procedure involving simple sample processing followed by direct mass spectral analysis and data prosessing. Thus, an uncomplicated approach has been developed to resolve a complex problem involving cellular pathogens. This method has enormous application potential in the rapid identification and subsequent prevention of any potential health hazard caused by the pathogenic bacteria, either under natural or induced conditions. There is a great potential for the total automation of the entire process in the future for simpler but more effective unattended operations in the laboratory as well as in the field.

TI Menstrual patterns during the inception of perimenopause: What are the
   predictors and what do they predict?

AB Using data from a British national cohort of women born in 1946, this study aims to identify menstrual patterns during the first year of perimenopause (based on the frequency of periods, the numbers of days bled each month, and menstrual flow) to see if they are related to health and behaviors earlier in adult life and if they predict entry into menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use. Three groups of women were identified using cluster analysis: those who experienced more of these characteristics, those who experienced less, and those who experienced few changes. In polychotomous logistic regression models, the likelihood ratio tests indicated that parity and body mass index (BMI) were significant at the 5% level. The odds ratios from the parity models showed a gradient, with women from the Less cluster being most likely to have no children and those from the More cluster most likely to have at least one child. A similar gradient was detected for BMI, with the Less cluster tending to be underweight. The Less cluster came into menopause significantly faster than the Same and the More groups, where the estimated hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) were, respectively, 0.61 (0.37-0.99) and 0.24 (0.11-0.52). There was no association between the clusters and later HRT use. The findings suggest that menstrual characteristics should be more carefully studied in population studies of the climacteric.

TI The Malacca Straits
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB The Malacca Straits have long been an important trade route linking the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean. From the seventh to the eleventh century, the Srivijaya empire controlled them, followed in the fifteenth century by the port kingdom of Malacca. Western maritime powers also recognized the strategic importance of the Straits, and in 1511, the Portuguese captured Malacca. In 1641, the Dutch occupied what is now known as Jakarta, and from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the Dutch East India company controlled the trade in the Straits (Ross et al,, 1995). The British also recognized the need to control the Straits to ensure the safe passage of British merchant ships on their way to China, and in 1819 established a colony in Singapore. In 1824, the British and the Dutch ended their rivalry with a treaty whereby Britain agreed to 'safeguard the Straits and keep them open for other friendly nations' (Chia, 1998).
   In recent years, the Straits have become a very important trade route. In 1993 and 1995, over 100 000 oil and cargo vessels traversed it each year, carrying 3.23 million barrels of crude oil through the Straits each day (Sakura Institute of Research, 1998), Shipping accidents have occurred more frequently, recently, which is attributed to heavy traffic in the Straits with shallow, narrow channels and shoals, Despite these hazards, economic efficiency dictates that vessels continue to use the Straits.
   The Straits are also rich in renewable and non-renewable resources, including productive coastal ecosystems, extensive capture fisheries, aquaculture, coastal tourism, mining and valuable natural gas reserves.
   This chapter looks at the natural environmental conditions and the status of the coastal resources, the sustainability of existing activities, critical environmental problems and management. It is based on the Malacca Straits Environmental Profile (Chua et al., 1997) and other studies undertaken by the GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Programme for Marine Pollution Prevention and Management in the East Asian Seas, referred to as the Regional Programme in this document.

AB MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use can cause neurochemical, behavioral and endocrine alterations, similar to those produced by exposure to acute stress, suggesting its potential as a "chemical stressor." It is known that stressful stimuli can produce a depression of immune function and an alteration in immune cells distribution. In vitro exposure to MDMA resulted in a modulation of several immune functional parameters such as T-cell regulatory function, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, natural killer cell activity and macrophage function.
   Administration of MDMA in rats produced a rapid and sustained suppression of induced lymphocytes proliferation and a significant decrease in circulating lymphocytes. These alterations in rat immune function were accompanied by a significant rapid increase in plasma corticosterone concentrations. It was postulated that the result of altered induced proliferation response of lymphocytes could have been due to a combined effect of direct action of MDMA on lymphocytes and to the activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis) and/or the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) via central mechanisms.
   In humans, acute MDMA treatment produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction associated with MDMA plasma concentrations. Although total leukocyte count remained unchanged, there was a decrease in CD4(+) T-cells and functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation, while percentage of natural killer cells significantly increased. A rise of cortisol plasma concentrations similar to that observed in the rat model supported the hypothesis of MDMA-induced release of corticotrophin-releasing factor from the median eminence of the hypothalamus and subsequent BPA axis and SNS activation. The present findings indicate that MDMA ingestion may represent a potential health hazard for an increased risk of immune system-related diseases.

DT Article
ID RADIATION
AB To account for the annual intensity of wildland fires, a theory has been formerly proposed : it is based on the effect of UV-B radiation on the sensitiveness of plants to fire ignition and propagation. It accounts very satisfactorily for the statistics of annual burned area in the French Mediterranean region. The paper is more particularly devoted to daily variation of the total ozone content of the atmosphere and its possible large daily drop : in the French Mediterranean region, large fires occur in general at the end of such drops, simultaneously in different parts of this region. The UV-B sensitiveness theory based on annual data may predict such large fire occurrence. So, taking into account the daily variation of ozone and solar flux helps to make short-term forecasts of the possibility of large fires in a determined region. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Colloids and dusty plasmas play an important role in natural hazards such as virus infections (colloids) and atmospheric pollution (dusty plasmas). Waves, excited by Brownian motion, are essential for diagnostics. For charged colloids a visco-elastic theory and an extension of the theory of Felderhof and Jones are used to derive the damping rates of the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively. For the dispersion relations of (propagating) waves in dusty plasmas a new kinetic theory is developed. All theoretical dispersion relations are compared with experimental and numerical data.

AB Steady mass shift as well as catastrophic mass-movement events are the natural expression of the dynamics of high-mountain mass-transport systems, causing a variety of natural hazards. Computer-aided aerial photogrammetry, especially a newly developed technique for determining surface velocity fields in 3D, offers a wide range of possibilities to map disasters and hazard potentials, to monitor medium- and long-term development of dangerous situations and to provide area-wide boundary conditions for 2D- and SD-modelling of kinetic and dynamic processes. Three pilot studies in the Swiss Alps illustrate the potential of high-precision and multi-temporal image analysis for early recognition of glacial and periglacial hazards: (1) The increasing risk of lake-outbursts and related debris-flows (up to several 10(5)m(3)) was detected by a 25-year monitoring series of glacier geometry, ice flow, permafrost creep and changes of glacier-lakes. (2) Analyzing permafrost creep above a potential starting zone of debris flows allowed for assessing mass transport and accumulation rates in this zone. (3) The kinetic processes and the extent of a rock slide (similar to 10(6) - 10(7)m(3)), induced by a marked retreat of a glacier tongue and the related stress-relief at the valley flanks could be determined.

TI Radioactivity in products derived from gypsum in Tanzania
SO RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Scientific investigations have long concluded that prolonged exposure to low dose radiation can induce deleterious effects in humans. The aim of this paper is to investigate the radioactivity of gypsum and gypsum derived products as part of a bigger project aimed at establishing radiation levels in materials or/and products suspected to have natural radioactivity radiation risk in Tanzania. In response to the concern expressed by the users of chalk sticks in some schools in Arusha municipality, it was found necessary to establish levels of radioactivity in this product and associated radiation risk. Natural radioactivity content was determined in chalk dust, natural gypsum and normal background soil using a hyper pure germanium spectrometer (HPGe). The soil measurements were used as control. Results have shown that the concentration of Ra-226 and Ra-228 nuclides found in chalk dust were 24.25 Bq.kg(-1) and 22.86 Bq.kg(-1), respectively. These levels were lower or comparable to the corresponding 34.2 Bq.kg(-1) and 21.5 Bq.kg(-1), respectively, found in soil. However, the radioactivity levels found in the chalk dust were five times higher than that found in the gypsum 5 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-226 and 4 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-228. These values compare well with the value recorded for natural gypsum in Denmark of 7 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-226 and 4 Bq.kg(-1) for Ra-228 by UNSCEAR. The calculated external (0.21) and internal (0.31) hazard indices due to radioactivity in chalk dust were respectively, lower than (0.26 and 0.35) hazard indices calculated for normal background soil. In both cases, the hazard indices were lower than the acceptable limits (less than or equal to 1) recommended for building materials. This study has shown that natural gypsum and gypsum derived products have traces of radioactivity. However, the associated levels are not detrimental to health.

AB This paper reviews the subject of natural hazards and the use of existing remote sensing systems in the different phases of disaster management for some specific natural hazards: forest fires, droughts and floods. It centers on the applicability of remote sensing for increasing preparedness, providing early warnings, monitoring the hazards in real time, and assessing the damage so that relief can be provided. Comparison of the information provided by existing systems and that needed for operational use of remote sensing in disaster management is also addressed. The capability of some of the future sensors to comply with the needs in the field of natural hazards is discussed. In this context current pilot projects carried on at the European Commission Joint Research Centre are presented.

AB The growth of winter travel on alpine roads in the western United States, a result of the demand for reliable winter access, has increased the hazard to motorists and highway maintenance personnel from snow avalanches. Configurations are presented for systems that can detect and provide, in real time, warnings to motorists and highway maintainers of roadway avalanches. These warnings include on-site traffic control signing, in-vehicle audio alarms for winter maintenance vehicles, and notifying maintenance facilities or centralized agency dispatchers. These avalanche detection and warning systems can detect an existing avalanche and use the avalanche's remaining time of descent to initiate on-site alarms. Alternatively, real-time knowledge and notification of the onset of avalanching may be used to proactively manage the evolving hazard over an affected length or corridor of highway. These corridors can be several tens of kilometers in length and may be very remote, low-volume rural highways. As a consequence, these detection and warning systems must be cost-effective alternatives to existing avalanche hazard reduction technology. Results and experiences from the winters of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 are presented, along with recommendations and criteria for future deployment of these automated natural hazard reduction systems for rural transportation corridors.

AB Objective: To compare the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients according to sex, route of HIV acquisition and education, and to assess the impact of differences in utilization on the probability of progression to AIDS.
   Design and setting: Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a national prospective multi-centre study.
   Participants: A total of 3342 patients, including 1007 (30%) women. HIV was acquired through injection drug use in 1155 (35%) cases and through sex between men in 1172 (35%). Twenty-eight per cent (957) of participants had attained only the minimum level of schooling. At baseline, the median CD4 cell count was 269 x 10(6)/l cells, median HIV-1 RNA was 4.3 log(10) copies/ml and 2917 (87%) were free of AIDS.
   Methods: Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox proportional hazards regression.
   Results: During 7007 person-years of follow-up 2285 (69%) patients started HAART and 318 (10%) developed a new AIDS event. In multivariable analysis controlling for CD4 cell count, viral load and disease stage at baseline, the probability of starting HAART was lower in injection drug users compared with men who have sex with men, hazard ratio 0.63 (95% confidence intervals 0.56-0.70) and in patients with minimum schooling compared with those with vocational training, hazard ratio 0.82 (0.75-0.91). The risk of progression to AIDS was similar among men and women, patients with a history of injecting drug use, and patients with lower educational attainment in both univariable and multivariable analysis.
   Conclusion: HIV-infected injecting drug users and those with lower levels of educational attainment start HAART later than other patient groups. The deferred initiation of therapy in these patients does not, however, appear to translate into an increased risk of clinical disease progression. This observation has important implications for treatment policy and the design of future clinical trials. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Objective: To assess whether the WHO staging classification for HIV provides prognostically Valuable and applicable information in rural Uganda.
   Patients and study design: Data were obtained from a population-based cohort of 232 HIV-infected individuals.
   Methods: Clinical information was obtained using a detailed questionnaire and ascertained by physical examination. Participants were seen routinely every 3 months and when they were sick. A computer algorithm based on clinical history, examination and laboratory findings was used to stage HIV-positive participants at each routine visit. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and the Cox proportional hazard model were used to assess the prognostic strength of the clinical and laboratory categories of the system.
   Results: An attendance rate of 81% and 799 person-years of follow-up were achieved. Survival probability estimates at 6 years from being seen in clinical stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 were 63, 46, 24 and 6% respectively. When staging was revised to incorporate lymphocyte categories, the survival probabilities were 73, 62, 39 and 6% respectively. Unexplained prolonged fever and severe bacterial infection had survival probabilities closer to stage 2 conditions, mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus infection for more than 1 month and crytosporidiosis with diarrhoea for more than 1 month closer to stage 3 and oral candidiasis closer to stage 4 conditions.
   Conclusions: Even without the laboratory markers, the clinical category of the WHO staging system is useful for predicting survival in individuals with HIV disease. This is important for areas with limited access to laboratory markers. A simple rearrangement of a few clinical conditions could improve the prognostic significance of the WHO system.

AB The authors examined the impact of smoking status on the relation between body mass index (weight (kg)/ height (m)(2)) and mortality across a group of 15 diverse observational studies. The studies included a heterogeneous sample of national samples, cohort studies with mortality follow-up, and clinical trials. Consideration of the data according to natural strata resulted in the formation of 42 analytic cohorts. The authors examined survival through the end of follow-up for each study, as influenced by body mass index, age, and current smoking status at baseline, using a proportional hazards model to describe the relation between body mass index and mortality with control for age and smoking status. in this paper, the authors demonstrate that the estimated body mass index of minimum mortality changes when data are analyzed while ignoring smoking status; but they also demonstrate through a simulation study that eliminating smokers from the data sets prior to analysis produces results similar to those expected from the elimination of numerically similar random proportions of the data sets prior to analysis. Based on the results of these analyses, the authors find no support for the commonly held practice of eliminating smokers from a data set prior to examining the body mass index-mortality relation.

DE tropical environment; floodplains; site selection; subsidence
AB The developing countries, located almost entirely within the tropics, are currently undergoing urbanization at a rapid pace. Many of these cities are not more than a few centuries old, having been established to function as regional trading posts or administrative centers by either colonial or regional powers. It is doubtful that the site conditions were taken into consideration, and consequently, many of these cities were established in hazardous or environmentally sensitive areas. As these cities developed over time, they spread across a wide range of terrain conditions much of which are unsuitable, such as floodplains, coastal swamps, steep slopes, or sand dunes. For a number of these cities, which are located near active plate margins and tropical cyclone belts, such problems are magnified. Increased demand for water has required subsurface extraction, leading to problems of subsidence and quality.
   We examine the range of these cities with reference to (1) their site-related problems, (2) the nature of geomorphological information required for specific ameliorating actions, and (3) the level of management required for city maintenance. Management requires interfacing geomorphology with engineering practices and urban planning. We present case studies of cities ranging from those with limited problems and possible engineering and land-zoning solutions (Singapore) to cities where the hazards (either natural or anthropogenic) are so acute and widespread that a practical solution is difficult to achieve (Kingston, Bangkok). Precise geomorphological and geological information and long-term data sets are not available for most of the cities. Furthermore, it is necessary to present the information in formats appreciated by the engineering and planning communities. Often a set of specialized maps are extremely useful. We complete the discussion with several examples and suggestions for collection of geomorphological information and inventory preparation for communicating geomorphological data to city engineers and planners.

AB In recent years, growing population and expansion of settlements and life-lines over hazardous areas have largely increased the impact of natural disasters both in industrialized and developing countries. Third world countries have difficulty meeting the high costs of controlling natural hazards through major engineering works and rational land-use planning. Industrialized societies are increasingly reluctant to invest money in structural measures that can reduce natural risks. Hence, the new issue is to implement warning systems and land utilization regulations aimed at minimizing the loss of lives and property without investing in long-term, costly projects of ground stabilization. Government and research institutions worldwide have long attempted to assess landslide hazard and risks and to portray its spatial distribution in maps. Several different methods for assessing landslide hazard were proposed or implemented. The reliability of these maps and the criteria behind these hazard evaluations are ill-formalized or poorly documented. Geomorphological information remains largely descriptive and subjective. It is, hence, somewhat unsuitable to engineers, policy-makers or developers when planning land resources and mitigating the effects of geological hazards. In the Umbria and Marche Regions of Central Italy, attempts at testing the proficiency and limitations of multivariate statistical techniques and of different methodologies for dividing the territory into suitable areas for landslide hazard assessment have been completed, or are in progress, at various scales. These experiments showed that, despite the operational and conceptual limitations, landslide hazard assessment may indeed constitute a suitable, cost-effective aid to land-use planning. Within this framework, engineering geomorphology may play a renewed role in assessing areas at high landslide hazard, and helping mitigate the associated risk. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB River engineering is coming under increasing public scrutiny given failures to prevent flood hazards and economic and environmental concerns. This paper reviews the contribution that fluvial geomorphology can make in the future to river engineering. In particular, it highlights the need for fluvial geomorphology to be an integral part in engineering projects, that is, to be integral to the planning, implementation, and post-project appraisal stages of engineering projects. It should be proactive rather than reactive. Areas in which geomorphologists will increasingly be able to complement engineers in river management include risk and environmental impact assessment, floodplain planning, river audits, determination of instream flow needs, river restoration, and design of ecologically acceptable channels and structures. There are four key contributions that fluvial geomorphology can make to the engineering profession with regard to river and floodplain management:
   1. to promote recognition of lateral, vertical, and downstream connectivity in the fluvial system and the inter-relationships between river planform, profile, and cross-section;
   2. to stress the importance of understanding fluvial history and chronology over a range of time scales, and recognizing the significance of both palaeo and active landforms and deposits as indicators of levels of landscape stability;
   3. to highlight the sensitivity of geomorphic systems to environmental disturbances and change, especially when close to geomorphic thresholds, and the dynamics of the natural systems; and
   4. to demonstrate the importance of landforms and processes in controlling and defining fluvial biotopes and to thus promote ecologically acceptable engineering.
   Challenges facing fluvial geomorphology include: gaining full acceptance by the engineering profession; widespread utilization of new technologies including GPS, GIS, image analysis of satellite and airborne remote sensing data, computer-based hydraulic modeling and geophysical techniques; dovetailing engineering approaches to the study of river channels which emphasize reach-scale flow resistance, shear stresses, and material strength with catchment scale geomorphic approaches, empirical predictions, bed and bank processes, landform evolution, and magnitude-frequency concepts; producing accepted river channel typologies; fundamental research aimed at producing more reliable deterministic equations for prediction of bed and bank stability and bedload transport; and collaboration with aquatic biologists to determine the role and importance of geomorphologically and hydraulically defined habitats.

AB Steep coastal margins are potentially subject to mass wasting processes involving notable landslide activity and sediment evacuation downstream by steep-gradient streams. Sediment transfer from short source-to-sink segments, coupled with mountain hydrological regimes, regulate patterns of river channel aggradation and coastal sediment supply in such geomorphic settings. On the steep French Riviera margin, sediment transfers from existing landslides or from various minor mass wasting processes to stream channels may result following bursts of heavy, concentrated rainfall. High-magnitude flooding and massive sediment transport downstream are generally related to unpredictable extreme rainfalls. Both mass movements and channel sediment storage pose serious hazards to downvalley settlements and infrastructure. A consideration of channel sediment storage patterns in the Var River catchment, the most important catchment in this area, highlights two important shortcomings relative to environmental engineering and hazard mitigation practices. In the first place, the appreciation of geomorphic processes is rather poor. This is illustrated by the undersized nature of engineering works constructed to mitigate hazards in the upstream bedload-dominated channels, and by the unforeseen effects that ten rock dams, constructed in the early 1970s, have had on downstream and coastal sediment storage and on sediment dispersal patterns and, consequently, valley flooding. Secondly, planners and environmental engineers have lacked foresight in valley and coastal management issues on this steep setting, notably as regards the reclaimed areas of the lower Var channel and delta liable to flooding. Urbanization and transport and environmental engineering works have progressively affected patterns of storage and transport of fine-grained sediments in the lower Var channel and delta. Meanwhile the problems raised by these changes have not been adequately addressed in terms of scientific research. A necessary future step in bettering the engineering solutions implemented to contain natural hazards or to harness water and sediment resources is that of fine-scale analysis of source-to-sink sediment transfer processes, of sediment budgets, of time-scales of storage in stream channels, and, finally, of high-magnitude hydrometeorological forcing events in this area. The way all these aspects have been modulated by engineering practices and socioeconomic development should also be an important part of such an analysis. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Mating can increase an individual's risk of mortality by predation. In response to predation hazards, males in some species court females less often, but alternatively engage in coerced copulations more frequently and females become less selective. Such predator-mediated shifts in mating tactics may result in higher lea els of multiple inseminations in females and, thus, in greater frequencies of females with broods of mixed paternity. We tested this hypothesis using two polymorphic microsatellite loci to estimate conservatively multiple paternity in broods of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) originating from ten natural populations that have evolved under different fish predation regimes in Trinidad. The frequency of broods that were multiply sired was significantly greater on average in populations experiencing high predation pressure compared to populations experiencing a relatively low predation risk. These results suggest that the intensity of male sperm competition covaries geographically with predation pressure in this species and that the local risk of predation mediates the opportunity for sexual selection within populations.

AB High levels of atmospheric contamination due to the re-suspension of pyrite particles from the mining waste slurry were recorded in the Guadiamar valley (the Guadiamar is a tributary of the Guadalquivir river) after the toxic spill of Aznalcollar, north of the Donana Natural Park (SW Spain). Major high-particulate events occurred during the extraction of the pyrite-rich mud layer, which covered an extensive area of the valley downstream of the confluence of the Agrio and Guadiamar rivers. This study deals with the monitoring of the ambient air quality at two stations near the village of Aznalcazar in the central part of the flooded area. Although the Spanish legal limit for atmospheric particles and lead in environmental air were not exceeded, high daily levels of total suspended particles (TSP) and of some elements with an environmental significance (As, Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, Tl and Zn) were recorded at Aznalcazar and in the Guadiamar valley during soil reclamation (July-August 1998). Despite a progressive decrease in TSP levels through September-October 1998, background was higher than the levels for the May-June period. Evolution of levels for most of the elements studied showed a similar trend. The exceptions were copper, which was partially increased by other emission sources such as fumigation activities, and sodium, which remained at relatively constant levels during the study period because of its marine origin. The physico-chemical characterisation of the atmospheric particulates allowed us to determine the major grain size modes of the pyrite related elements and the solubility of the potentially toxic elements, and to identify the major particulate types present in the atmosphere in the area. Secondary and tertiary aromatic amines (i.e. alkyldiphenylamines and phenylcarbazoles, respectively) were identified in the suspended particles and in the vapour phase collected at the same station as the TSP samples. As some of these aromatic amines had been previously identified in the pyrite sludge, it is assumed that fine sludge particles containing aromatic amines were re-suspended in the atmosphere. The highest concentrations of aromatic amines in the particulate phase were recorded in August 1998 during the pyrite slurry extraction in the proximity of the Aznalcazar sampling site. Despite a sharp drop in the suspended particles of the aromatic amine concentrations, a significant concentration was detected in the vapour phase (<1.2 mm) during autumn, probably because of longer residence time in the atmosphere. Although health hazards associated with the presence of these aromatic amines are unknown, their acute toxicity exceeded that of urban aerosols. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The United Nations, recognizing natural disasters as a major threat to human life and development, designed the 1990-1999 period as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UN/IDNDR; UN Res. 42/169/ 1987). Among the IDNDR Demonstration Projects is the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP), launched in 1992 by the International Lithosphere Program (ILP) and implemented in the 1992-1999 period. In order to mitigate the risk associated to the recurrence of earthquakes, the GSHAP promoted a regionally coordinated, homogeneous approach to seismic hazard evaluation. To achieve a global dimension, the GSHAP established initially a mosaic of regions and multinational test areas, then expanded to cover whole continents and finally the globe. The GSHAP Global Map of Seismic Hazard integrates the results obtained in the regional areas and depicts Peak-Ground-Acceleration (PGA) with 10% chance of exceedance in 50 years, corresponding to a return period of 475 years. All regional results and the Global Map of Seismic Hazard are published in 1999 and available on the GS HAP homepage on http://seismo.ethz.ch/GSHAP/.

DE seismic hazard assessment; North-South America; earthquakes; UN/IDNDR
AB Vulnerability to natural disasters increases with urbanization and development of associated support systems (reservoirs, power plants, etc.). Catastrophic earthquakes account for 60% of worldwide casualties associated with natural disasters. Economic damage from earthquakes is increasing, even in technologically advanced countries with some level of seismic zonation, as shown by the 1989 Loma Prieta, CA ($ 6 billion), 1994 Northridge, CA ($ 25 billion), and 1995 Kobe, Japan (> $ 100 billion) earthquakes. The growth of megacities in seismically active regions around the world often includes the construction of seismically unsafe buildings and infrastructures, due to an insufficient knowledge of existing seismic hazard. Minimization of the loss of life, property damage, and social and economic disruption due to earthquakes depends on reliable estimates of seismic hazard. National, state, and local governments, decision makers, engineers, planners, emergency response organizations, builders, universities, and the general public require seismic hazard estimates for land use planning, improved building design and construction (including adoption of building construction codes), emergency response preparedness plans, economic forecasts, housing and employment decisions, and many more types of risk mitigation. The seismic hazard map of the Americas is the concatenation of various national and regional maps, involving a suite of approaches. The combined maps and documentation provide a useful global seismic hazard framework and serve as a resource for any national or regional agency for further detailed studies applicable to their needs. This seismic hazard map depicts Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) with a 10% chance of exceedance in 50 years for the western hemisphere. PGA. a short-period ground motion parameter that is proportional to force, is the most commonly mapped ground motion parameter because current building codes that include seismic provisions specify the horizontal force a building should be able to withstand during an earthquake. This seismic hazard map of the Americas depicts the likely level of short-period ground motion from earthquakes in a fifty-year window. Short-period ground motions effect short-period structures (e.g., one-to-two story buildings). The largest seismic hazard values in the western hemisphere generally occur in areas that have been, or are likely to be, the sires of the largest plate boundary earthquakes. Although the largest earthquakes ever recorded are the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska subduction zone earthquakes. the largest seismic hazard (PGA) value in the Americas is in Southern California (U.S.), along the San Andreas fault.

AB Groups of gas-flow lantern mantles of different manufacturers were subjected to radiometric investigation to evaluate the radiological hazards arising from their usage. Interest was given to the long-lived radionuclides found, which were the alpha-emitting nuclides of thorium and Ra-228. Thorium isotopes were analyzed by alpha-spectrometry whereas Ra-228 was analyzed by gamma-spectrometry. The results show that mantles from different manufacturers contain mainly natural thorium with levels that fluctuate over a very wide range, from 350 to 4560 Bq/mantle. For the same manufacturer, thorium levels vary strongly in mantles of different batches and even from the same batch. On burning the mantle, a 10-20% reduction in the thorium activity takes place in the first few minutes. The mantle containers were almost free from significant thorium contamination. Results are given and discussed in detail. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concentrations and distribution of natural and anthropogenic radioactive materials in sediments and soils from around the two major rivers and coastal area of Chittagong, Bangladesh were investigated with an aim of evaluating the environmental radioactivity and radiation hazard. In the sediment and soils in general, the concentration of Th-232 was found to be higher than that of the U-238 and the activities of Th-232 and U-238 in this area are higher than the world average. Cs-137 was observed in all the samples, ranging from 0.4 to 3.88 Bq kg(-1). The radium equivalent activities, emanation coefficients and radon exhalation rates were estimated for the sediment and soils; the emanation coefficients, radon exhalation rates and dose rates were found to be higher than the world average values.

AB We studied the relationship between age and prevalence, duration and incidence of clinical and laboratory evidence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis infection in a cohort of Gambian subjects examined bi-weekly for 6 months. The duration of disease and infection, estimated by stratified survival analysis, proportional hazards regression and Weibull modelling, was markedly age-dependent. The estimated median duration of disease was 13 2 weeks in 13.2-year-old subjects and 1.7 weeks in those age 15 and over. Adjustment for multiple infections, and for missing observations did not alter this trend. The cumulative incidence rate of disease was reduced threefold with age. More rapid disease resolution is the main source of reduction in prevalence of active trachoma and ocular C. trachomatis infection with age; disease incidence was reduced to a lesser extent. This age-dependent resolution may be effected by adaptive cellular immune mechanisms. Mechanisms responsible for natural immunity should receive appropriate emphasis in vaccine design.

AB A laboratory worker developed clinical signs of infection with Mayaro virus (Togaviridae), an arbovirus of South and Central America, 6 days after preparation of Mayaro viral antigen and 10 days after a trip to a rain forest. There was no evidence of skin lesions during the antigen preparation, and level 3 containment safety measures were followed. Therefore, molecular characterization of the virus was undertaken to identify the source of infection. RT-PCR and DNA sequence comparisons proved the infection was with the laboratory strain. Airborne Mayaro virus contamination is thus a hazard to laboratory personnel.

AB OBJECTIVES We sought to assess the incidence and determinants of sudden death (SUD) in mitral regurgitation due to flail leaflet (MR-FL).
   BACKGROUND Sudden death is a catastrophic complication of MR-FL. Its incidence and predictability are undefined.
   METHODS The occurrence of SUD was analyzed in 348 patients (age 67 +/- 12 years) with MR-FL diagnosed echocardiographically from 1980 through 1994.
   RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 48 +/- 41 months, 99 deaths occurred under medical treatment. Sudden death occurred in 25 patients, three of whom were resuscitated. The sudden death rates at five and 10 years were 8.6 +/- 2% and 18.8 +/- 4%, respectively, and the linearized rate was 1.8% per year. By multivariate analysis, the independent baseline predictors of SUD were New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (p = 0.006), ejection fraction (p = 0.0001) and atrial fibrillation (p = 0.059). The yearly linearized rate of sudden death was 1% in patients in functional class I, 3.1% in class II and 7.8% in classes III and IV. However, of 25 patients who had SUD, at baseline, 10 (40%) were in functional class I, 9 (36%) were in class II and only 6 (24%) in class III or IV. In five patients (20%), no evidence of risk factors developed until SUD. In patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 60% and sinus rhythm, the Linearized rate of SUD was not different in functional classes I and II (0.8% per year). Surgical correction of MR (n = 186) was independently associated with a reduced incidence of SUD (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.29 [0.11 to 0.72], p = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS Sudden death is relatively common in patients with MR-FL who are conservatively managed. Patients with severe symptoms, atrial fibrillation and reduced systolic function are at higher risk, but notable rates of SUD have been observed without these risk factors. Correction of MR appears to be associated with a reduced incidence of SUD, warranting early consideration of surgical repair. (C) 1999 by the American College of Cardiology.

AB Haryana, primarily an agricultural State, is rapidly transforming into an industrial State. Most part of the area in the State is occupied by vast stretches of Quaternary Alluvial plains separating the rocks of Delhi Supergroup in the south and west and Siwalik in the northeast. Various geomorphic landforms have been identified. Central Alluvial Plains occupy about ninety five percent of the total area of the State while the hard rocks are exposed only in five percent of the total area. Based on geological, geomorphological set up and geochemical studies, it has been possible to conclude that the potential environmental hazards distinctly differ in each land form. Two types of environmental hazards, viz., natural hazards and biotic or anthropogenic hazards have been recognised. The natural hazards, viz., salinity, salt efflorescence, sand remobilisation, bad land and water logging mainly affect the Central Alluvial Plains, while biotic or anthropogenic hazards, viz., mining, quarrying, wastage disposal, leakage from canals and excess drawal of water affect all the geomorphic landforms. Effective management controls have been suggested to mitigate the natural hazards and proper planning measures to control biotic hazards.

ID SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; NETWORKS; MODEL; TREES
AB The concept of self-organized criticality was introduced to explain the behavior of the cellular-automata sandpile model. A variety of multiple slider-block and forest-fire models have been introduced which are also said to exhibit self-organized critical behavior. It has been argued that earthquakes, landslides, forest-fires, and extinctions are examples of self-organized criticality in nature. The basic forest-fire model is particularly interesting in terms of its relation to the critical-point behavior of the site-percolation model. In the basic forest-fire model trees are randomly planted on a grid of points, periodically sparks are randomly dropped on the grid and if a spark drops on a tree that tree and the adjacent trees burn in a model fire. In the forest-lire model there is an inverse cascade of trees from small clusters to large clusters, trees are lost primarily from model fires that destroy the largest clusters, This quasi-steady-state cascade gives a power-law frequency-area distribution for both clusters of trees and smaller fires. The site-percolation model is equivalent to the forest-fire model without fires. In this case there is a transient cascade of trees from small to large clusters and a power-law distribution is found only at a critical density of trees. The earth's topography is an example of both statistically self-similar and self-affine fractals. Landforms are also associated with drainage networks, which are statistical fractal trees. A universal feature of drainage networks and other growth networks is side branching. Deterministic space-filling networks with side-branching symmetries are illustrated. It is shown that naturally occurring drainage networks have symmetries similar to diffusion-limited aggregation clusters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

AB Widespread interest in producing transgenic organisms is balanced by concern over ecological hazards, such as species extinction if such organisms were to be released into nature. An ecological risk associated with the introduction of a transgenic organism is that the transgene. though rare, can spread in a natural population. An increase in transgene frequency is often assumed to be unlikely because transgenic organisms typically have some viability disadvantage. Reduced viability is assumed to be common because transgenic individuals are best viewed as macromutants that lack any history of selection that could reduce negative fitness effects. However, these arguments ignore the potential advantageous effects of transgenes on some aspect of fitness such as mating success. Here, we examine the risk to a natural population after release of a few transgenic individuals when the transgene trait simultaneously increases transgenic male mating success and lowers the viability of transgenic offspring. We obtained relevant life history data by using the small cyprinodont fish, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) as a model. Our deterministic equations predict that a transgene introduced into a natural population by a small number of transgenic fish will spread as a result of enhanced mating advantage, but the reduced viability of offspring will cause eventual local extinction of both populations. Such risks should be evaluated with each new transgenic animal before release.

AB BACKGROUND. The effect of intravesical instillation of doxorubicin or epirubicin after transurethral resection (TUR) was estimated from the data of five randomized clinical trials in Japan. The authors provided the estimated hazard function plots with a smoothing technique, to evaluate the prophylactic effect of an intravesical therapy over time and to estimate the natural history of superficial bladder carcinoma.
   METHODS. Data on a total of 1732 patients from 5 studies of the Japanese Urological Cancer Research Group who were eligible to receive doxorubicin and epirubicin were analyzed. The patients were divided into four subgroups based on their background characteristics. Their tumors were categorized as "primary and solitary," "primary and multiple," "recurrent and solitary," or "recurrent and multiple."
   RESULTS. Multivariate analysis revealed that intravesical instillation reduced the risk of recurrence to about one-half to two-thirds compared with the controls. The shapes of the graphs that estimated the hazard function for patients with no prophylaxis indicated that multiple tumors showed an earlier peak of recurrence than solitary tumors and recurrent tumors had a higher hazard of recurrence than primary tumors. Graphic presentation of the hazard function in each subgroup suggested that the effect of prophylaxis continued for 500 days after TUR but not for longer.
   CONCLUSIONS. This analysis indicated that there are two patterns of tumor recurrence of superficial bladder carcinoma after TUR, namely, early phase and late phase. Intravesical chemotherapy may be effective mainly in reducing the hazard for recurrence in the early phase. (C) 1999 American Cancer Society.

AB Applied historical ecology is the use of historical knowledge in the management of ecosystems. Historical perspectives increase our understanding of the dynamic nature of landscapes and provide a frame of reference for assessing modern patterns and processes. Historical records, however, are often too brief or fragmentary to be useful, or they are not obtainable for the process or structure of interest. Even where long historical time series can be assembled, selection of appropriate reference conditions may be complicated by the past influence of humans and the many potential reference conditions encompassed by nonequilibrium dynamics. These complications, however, do not lessen the value of history; rather they underscore the need for multiple, comparative histories from many locations for evaluating both cultural and natural causes of variability, as well as for characterizing the overall dynamical properties of ecosystems. Historical knowledge may not simplify the task of setting management goals and making decisions, but 20th century trends, such as increasingly severe wildfires, suggest that disregarding history can be perilous.
   We describe examples from our research in the southwestern United States to illustrate some of the values and limitations of applied historical ecology. Paleoecological data from packrat middens and other natural archives have been useful for defining baseline conditions of vegetation communities, determining histories and rates of species range expansions and contractions, and discriminating between natural and cultural causes of environmental change. We describe a montane grassland restoration project in northern New Mexico that was justified and guided by an historical sequence of aerial photographs showing progressive tree invasion during the 20th century. Likewise, fire scar chronologies have been widely used to justify and guide fuel reduction and natural fire reintroduction in forests. A southwestern network of fire histories illustrates the power of aggregating historical time series across spatial scales. Regional fire patterns evident in these aggregations point to the key role of interannual lags in responses of fuels and fire regimes to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (wet/dry cycles), with important implications for long-range fire hazard forecasting. These examples of applied historical ecology emphasize that detection and explanation of historical trends and variability are essential to informed management.

AB Trace levels of surfactants, due to their wide range of applications in every-day life, can be proved very detrimental to the environment. In order to assess the impact of surfactants on the water sources of Greece and the associated health risks, a number of natural, tap and bottled water samples were collected and analyzed using an extractive-photometric technique. All samples contained anionic surfactants below the permissible limits, indicating that surface waters are not polluted and that drinking waters do not constitute any health hazards to humans.

AB The Directorate-General V at the European Commission has published a report called "Guidance on risk assessment at work". Several industrial enterprises and associations also have issued corresponding guidelines. The field presents quite a diverse variety on how risks should be assessed and managed at work, who should do it and in which form reports should be presented and to whom. The understanding of different directives and guidelines is further aggravated by confusing subtleties in definitions and terminology, Traditionally Occupational Health Professionals have had their natural consultative role in Risk Assessment and Risk Management, but growing changes in attitudes tend more and more to ignore the importance of health expertise while dealing with risks threatening health. Terminology in terms of "Hazard", "Risk", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Management" will be addresses and explained. Examples of guiding will be presented.

AB Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is contained in cruciferous plants which are part of the human diet. Numerous reports indicate that BITC prevents chemically induced cancer in laboratory animals and it has been postulated that BITC might also be chemoprotective in humans. On the other hand, evidence is accumulating that this compound is a potent genotoxin in mammalian cells by itself. To further elucidate the potential hazards of BITC, we investigated its genotoxic effects in different in vitro genotoxicity tests and in animal models. In in-vitro experiments [differential DNA repair assay with Escherichia coli, micronucleus assay with human HepG2 cells and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay with hepatocytes and gastrointestinal tract cells] pronounced dose-dependent genotoxic effects were found at low dose levels (less than or equal to 5 mu g/ml). In contrast, substantially weaker effects were obtained in in vivo experiments with laboratory rodents: in the differential DNA repair assay with E. coli cells, only moderate genotoxic effects were seen in indicator cells recovered from various organs of mice after treatment with high doses (between 90 and 270 mg/kg), while in SCGE assay with rats a change in the DNA migration pattern was seen at a dose level of 220 mg/ kg body wt. These findings indicate that BITC is detoxified under in vivo test conditions. This assumption was supported by the results of in vitro experiments which showed that the genotoxic effects of BITC are markedly reduced by bovine serum albumin and human body fluids such as saliva and gastric juice. Additional experiments carried out on the mechanistic aspects of the genotoxicity of BITC showed that this compound causes formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in HepG2 cells and that its DNA damaging properties are diminished by alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, sodium benzoate and beta-carotene, indicating the possible involvement of free radicals in the genotoxicity of BITC. The doses of BITC required to cause measurable DNA damage in laboratory rodents exceeded by far the dietary exposure levels of humans, but are similar to those which were required to inhibit chemically induced cancer in earlier animal experiments.

AB The concept of self-organized criticality evolved from studies of three simple cellular-automata models: the sand-pile, slider-block, and forest-fire models. In each case, there is a steady "input'' and the "loss'' is associated with a fractal (power-law) distribution of "avalanches.'' Each of the three models can be associated with an important natural hazard: the sand-pile model with landslides, the slider-block model with earthquakes, and the forest-fire model with forest fires. We show that each of the three natural hazards have frequency-size statistics that are well approximated by power-law distributions. The model behavior suggests that the recurrence interval for a severe event can be estimated by extrapolating the observed frequency-size distribution of small and medium events. For example, the recurrence interval for a magnitude seven earthquake can be obtained directly from the observed frequency of occurrence of magnitude four earthquakes. This concept leads to the definition of a seismic intensity factor. Both global and regional maps of this seismic intensity factor are given. In addition, the behavior of the models suggests that the risk of occurrence of large events can be substantially reduced if small events are encouraged. For example, if small forest fires are allowed to burn, the risk of a large forest fire is substantially reduced.

ID MODELS
AB Technologies such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have raised great expectations as potential means of coping with natural disasters, including landslides. However, several misconceptions on the potential of GIS are widespread. Prominent among these is the belief that a landslide hazard map obtained by systematic data manipulation within a GIS is assumed to be more objective than a comparable hand-made product derived from the same input data and founded on the same conceptual model. Geographical data can now be handled in a GIS environment by users who are not experts in either GIS or natural hazard process fields. The reality of the successful application of GIS within the landslide hazard domain seems to be somewhat less attractive than current optimistic expectations.
   In spite of recent achievements, the use of GIS in the domain of prevention and mitigation of natural catastrophes remains a pioneering activity. Diffusion of the technology is still hampered by factors such as the difficulty in acquiring appropriate raw data, the intrinsic complexity of predictive models, the lack of efficient graphical user interfaces, the high cost of digitisation, and the persistence of bottlenecks in hardware capabilities.
   In addition, researchers are investing more in tuning-up hazard models founded upon existing, often unreliable data than in attempting to initiate long-term projects for the acquisition of new data on the causes of catastrophic events. Governmental institutions are frequently involved in risk reduction projects whose design and implementation appear to be governed more by political issues than by technical ones. There is an unfortunate general tendency to search for data which can be collected at low cost rather than attempting to capture the information which most readily explains the causes of a disaster.
   If the technical, cultural, economic and political reasons for this unhealthy state cannot be adequately tackled, the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction will probably come to an end without achieving significant advances in the prediction and control of natural disasters.

AB This paper focuses on the application of landslide activity maps for evaluating the mass movement hazard in selected areas of the Southern Apennines of Italy: Bisaccia, Calitri, and Buoninventre. The availability of multi-year aerial photo coverage helped to assess the morphological changes which occurred in the last 40 years. This information, integrated with historical data on slope instability and field checks, were used to produce landslide activity maps. These maps represent a short-cut in the assessment of mass movement hazard, because they focus on the effects of slope instability rather than on the causative conditions and processes; however, if kept simple and prepared at large scale, they may help the local administrators and land-use planners to reduce the socio-economic costs of landslides. Furthermore, the comparative study of landslide activity represents a relatively inexpensive and quick method for evaluating the performance of the engineering control efforts. The quantification of landslide activity in terms of areal frequency can represent an additional step, useful to determine the relative landslide hazard (zonation in more or less hazardous areas). For example, the estimates of areal frequency of active landsliding for the last 40 years demonstrated the great influence of the 1980 Irpinia earthquake (M-s = 6.9) on the stability of slopes situated close to its epicenter (within a radius of about 20 km).

AB In this paper we present an application that exploits a geographic information system as a front-end of a complex information system supporting the management of landslide hazard in Valtellina, an alpine valley in Northern Italy.
   A decision support system (EYDENET, operational since October 1996), incorporating a geographic information system and a data interpreter based on artificial intelligence techniques, processes the readings of the 250 most significant instruments of a monitoring net of about 1000 sensors installed on different landslides in several alpine valleys.
   Data gathered by extensometers, clinometers and pluviometers, to check both movements of rocks and climatic conditions which could affect them, are processed by EYDENET, that provides on-line interpretation of data, helps the users analyse them, and generates natural language explanations and alarm messages for the people responsible for the environmental management and the civil protection.

AB A priority task for correct environmental planning is to evaluate Natural Hazards, especially in highly populated areas. In particular, thorough investigations based on different Earth Science techniques must be addressed for the Seismic Hazard Assessment (SHA) in tectonically active areas. Not only the management but also the multidisciplinary analysis of all the SHA-related data sets is best performed using a Geographic Information System. In this paper we show how a research-oriented GIS is built and used in a practical case. The Geochemical Geographic Information System (G(2)IS) was developed and applied to the Gargano promontory (southern Italy) in the framework of an EC research project, the Geochemical Seismic Zonation (GSZ) Project. This multidisciplinary - multiscaling powerful tool is described in its structure, updating procedures and manipulation techniques. Preliminary results are presented on the detection of geochemically active fault zones and their correlation with remote sensing data and other evidences of seismogenic structures.

AB Objective. To review the current literature on the hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection, with particular attention to the aspects of interest for the dental staff.
   Material and methods. The authors searched for original research and review articles on specific aspects of the HGV infection including virology, epidemiology, transmission, natural history, and dental aspects of HGV infection. The relevant articles were evaluated and reviewed.
   Results. HGV is a parenterally transmitted RNA virus that may cause acute, chronic, and fulminant liver disease; however, the real pathogenic potential of this virus and its possible effect on other hepatitic infections is still to be clarified. Preliminary studies have failed to demonstrate strong relationships between HGV infection and any oral disease. At present, data on the prevalence of HGV infection among health care workers are scarce. Nevertheless, in view of the potential transmission rates of HGV and the lack of effective immunization, HGV should be regarded as a potential occupational hazard for medical and dental staff.
   Conclusion. Many virological, medical, and oral aspects of HGV infection need to be further investigated; nevertheless, until related data are available, HGV should be considered to be an infection that may be transmitted during dental care.

TI Avalanche hazard in Glacier National Park: An El Nino connection?
SO PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE snow avalanches; El Nino; Glacier National Park (GNP)
AB Snow avalanches are a cold-season natural hazard in the Glacier National Park (CNP), Montana, region. They are responsible for the closure of critical transportation routes, property damage, and, on occasion, fatalities. This study examined local newspaper reports of avalanches during the period from 1949 to 1997 and found a tendency for El Nino years to be associated with a decrease in snow avalanches in the region. This decrease in frequency may be caused by the below-normal precipitation that occurs in the region during El Nino years. Additional factors, such as primary storm-track direction, and temperature cycling also should be examined.

TI Damage detection using the frequency-response-function curvature method
SO JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Structural damage detection has gained increasing attention from the scientific community since unpredicted major hazards, most with human losses, have been reported. Aircraft crashes and the catastrophic bridge failures are some examples. Security and economy aspects are the important motivations for increasing research on structural health monitoring. Since damage alters the dynamic characteristics of a structure, namely its eigenproperties (natural frequencies, modal damping and modes of vibration), several techniques based on experimental modal analysis have been developed in recent years. A method that covers the four steps of the process of damage detection-existence, localization, extent and prediction-has not yet been recognized or reported. The frequency-response-function (FRF) curvature method encompasses the first three referred steps being based on only the measured data without the need for any modal identification. In this paper, the method is described theoretically and compared with two of the most referenced methods on literature. Numerically generated data, from a lumped-mass system, and experimental data, from a real bridge, are used for better illustration. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Objective: To estimate the change in survival of patients with AIDS-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in relation to the introduction of protease inhibitors (PI).
   Design: The French Hospital Database on HIV (FHDH) is a prospective cohort of 70 224 HIV-infected subjects. This study included the patients diagnosed with PML between 1 July 1995 and 30 June 1997. PML diagnosis was both presumptive and confirmed. We compared the survival probability according to the diagnosis period (period 1 or 2, before or after introduction of PI in France on 1 April 1996). Cox's model was used to calculate the relative hazards of death according to the antiretroviral regimen.
   Results: The study included 246 patients, 109 diagnosed during period 1 and 137 during period 2. In all, 131 patients received an antiretroviral combination that included PI. By 31 December 1997, a total of 131 deaths had been reported. The probability of survival at 6 months for patients from period 2 was nearly twice as high as for patients from period 1 (60.5 versus 34.5%). In comparison with patients receiving no treatment, the risk of death in patients on combination therapy not including PI was reduced by 38% [relative hazard (RH) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (Cl) (0.41; 0.95), P = 0.026] and in patients on combination therapy with PI, by 63% [RH 0.37, 95% Cl (0.22; 0.64), P = 0.0004].
   Conclusion: This study of a large cohort of patients diagnosed with PML (n = 246), provides evidence that a combination antiretroviral regimen, especially one including PI, confers marked survival benefits. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Background Patients presenting for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery may have concurrent asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic insufficiency (AI). This retrospective study was performed to evaluate outcomes in patients with aortic valve disease undergoing CABG with or without aortic valve replacement (AVR).
   Methods study groups included 414 patients undergoing combined AVR and CABG (AVR-CABG group) and 62 patients with asymptomatic mild-to-moderate AS, Al, or both undergoing CABG but not AVR (CABG group). End points included 30-day mortality rate, time to cardiac mortality, time to all-cause mortality, and time to aortic valve reoperation. Reoperation refers to surgery for replacement of the native aortic valve in the CABG group or replacement of the prosthetic aortic valve in the AVR-CABG group. important patient characteristics affecting outcomes were determined by using Cox proportional-hazard analysis. These variables were then included in multivariable analyses by using logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional-hazard modeling to compare outcomes between each patient group.
   Results No difference was seen in any of the mortality end points between the CABG group and the AVR-CABG group after controlling for significant differences between the groups. However, the need for reoperation for AVR was significantly higher for the CABG group than the AVR-CABG group. For patients followed for up to 6 years, the estimated need for aortic valve reoperation was 24.3% in the CABG group versus 3% in the AVR-CABG group.
   Conclusion On the basis of these results, patients with asymptomatic AS or At should be considered for AVR at the time of CABG.

AB Objective: To examine whether the use of psychiatric medication and the presence of abnormal behaviors affects the progression of Alzheimer disease.
   Design: Cross-sectional with longitudinal follow-up and the likelihood of arriving at 4 end points: (1) Mini-Mental State Examination score of 9 or lower; (2) Blessed Dementia Rating Scale score of 15 or higher for activities of daily living; (3) nursing home admission; and (4) death, evaluated using a proportional hazard model with 9 variables: psychosis, insomnia, wandering, aggression, psychomotor agitation, depression, and use of antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, or sedatives/hypnotics.
   Setting: Multidisciplinary dementia research clinic.
   Patients: We examined baseline and follow-up behavioral symptoms and the use of psychiatric medication in 179 mildly to moderately impaired patients with probable Alzheimer disease participating in a longitudinal study of dementia. Patients were observed from 2.4 to 172 months (mean duration +/- SD, 49.5 +/- 27.4 months).
   Results: Nine patients (5%) were taking sedatives/hypnotics ; 16 (9%), antipsychotic agents; and 22 (12%), antidepressants at study entry. Patients laking antipsychotic agents had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and higher Blessed Dementia Rating Scale scores for activities of daily living than patients not taking any medication. Using proportional hazard analysis with time-dependent covariates for individual psychiatric symptoms and medications, we found that the development of psychosis was associated with functional decline (time to Blessed Dementia Rating Scale score of greater than or equal to 15), institutionalization, aggression, and agitation with functional decline after adjusting for age at study entry, education, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and Blessed Dementia Rating Scale scores. Use of antipsychotic medication was associated with functional decline, and sedatives/hypnotics with death. Neither the presence of psychiatric symptoms nor use of medication was associated with rate of cognitive decline (time to Mini-Mental State Examination score of less than or equal to 9).
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that the use of antipsychotic agents and sedatives can affect the natural course of Alzheimer disease. Psychosis, agitation, and aggression are important predictors of outcome, even when the effects of medication to treat them is taken into account.

TI Application of complementary DNA microarray technology to carcinogen
   identification, toxicology, and drug safety evaluation
SO CANCER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB One major challenge facing today's cancer researchers and toxicologists is the development of new approaches for the identification of carcinogens and other environmental hazards. Here, we describe the potential impact of emerging technologies for measuring gene expression profiles on carcinogen identification and on the general field of toxicology. An example of one of these technologies is the use of cDNA microarray chips. We provide an overview to the key questions that are confronting investigators charged with determining the relative safety of natural or synthetic chemicals to which humans are exposed, followed by a discussion of how cDNA microarray technology may be applied to these questions. Gene chip technology is still a relatively new technology, and only a handful of studies have demonstrated its utility. However, as the technical hurdles to development are passed, the use of this methodology in addressing the questions raised here will be critical to increase the sensitivity of detection of the potential toxic effects of environmental chemicals and to understand their risks to humans.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provide unique information about the earth's surface and biodiversity, including critical data for natural hazards and resource assessments. The ability to calculate the cross-section of a scatterer for any transmit and receive polarisation combination provides detailed information about vegetation for assessing changes in land cover, biomass and forest regrowth. Unique SAR interferometric measurements, predominantly large-scale surface change at fine resolution, are used to generate topographic data sets, monitor surface topographic change, and measure glacier ice velocity. The LightSAR Mission, planned for launch in 2002 will be optimised for polarimetric and interferometric data acquisition in order to provide long-term observations of the earth's changing conditions.

AB After the bioremediation of soils contaminated with mineral oil products, residual contaminants (designated as total solvent extractable material [TSEM]) remain therein. Since limited information is available about the movement and fate of these residual contaminants in the environment, the potential environmental hazards are difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the relevant transport and transformation processes of the residual contaminants in bioremediated soil such as volatilization, leaching, and further biodegradation and to conduct a mass flow analysis for the TSEM in bioremediated soil for the first year after application as top soil. The results indicate that after 1 year, the major portion (93%) of the TSEM can be recovered in the top soil and 7% of the TSEM was lost. The majority of the total losses (>98%) was due to transformation processes (biodegradation and aging effects), while small amounts escaped into the atmosphere (0.08%), plant uptake was negligible, (<0.001%) and leaching, identified as the major transport process, accounted for only small effects (1.7%).

AB Recent research has changed our understanding of the nature of environmental hazards, and they are not. increasingly tenner-stood as 'culturally-mediated' effects of the relationship between society and the environment In the Basilicata region of Italy the perception of a crisis of soil erosion is strongly influenced by contemporary cultural attitudes However, despite an increased sensitivity to soil erosion, the hazard is a genuine threat. Basilicata has a high natural vulnerability to erosion, but the 'normal' levels of erosion there have been greatly magnified by human activity - notably deforestation, agriculture, settlement and an inadequate level of soil conservation. The local effect of these underlying factors can be seen from the environmental history of the municipality of Grassano.

AB To validate the AHCPR classification for thr prognosis of unstable angina, 225 consecutive patients were recruited with a suspected diagnosis of that condition attending a tertiary hospital from November 1994 through April 1995 and followed for one year. One-hundred fifty-six (69.3%) patients were considered at high risk, 37 (16.5%) at intermediate, and 32 (14.2%) at low risk of cardiac complications. All of the patients with major in-hospital cardiac complications (8 patients) had at least one of the features of the high risk group. The high to intermediate-low hazard ratio (HR) for one-year cardiac complications after the onset of unstable angina was 4.03. Predictors of major complications (myocardial infarction or death) after the follow-up were age > 65 (HR, 5.69); diabetes (HR, 4.94); heart failure (HR, 2.65); and prolonged angina (HR, 2.55). AHCPR classification correctly identified patients with risk of severe outcomes at the hospital. Also, the classification predicted outcomes one year after hospitalization, diabetes being an important determinant of adverse cardiac events. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Purpose: A significant number of patients with stage T1 bladder carcinoma are at risk for cancer progression. We sought to identify factors associated with cancer progression in a series of patients with stage T1 bladder carcinoma treated with a contemporary therapeutic approach.
   Patients and Methods: The study population consisted of 83 consecutive patients in whom stage T1 bladder carcinoma wets diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic between 1987 and 1992, All patients underwent trans-urethral resection of the bladder (TURB) and had histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. The mean age war 71 years (range, 47 to 94 years), The male-to-female ratio was 3.9:1. The mean length of follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 1 day to 10.4 years), The depth of lamina propria invasion in the TURB specimens was measured with an ocular micrometer. Cancer progression was defined as the development of muscle-invasive or more advanced stage carcinoma, distant metastasis, or death from bladder cancer.
   Results: The overall 5- and 7-year progression-free survival Kites were 82% and 80%, respectively The depth of invasion in the TURB specimens was associated with cancer progression (hazards ratio, 1.6 for doubling of depth of invasion; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.4; P = .037), The 5-year progression-free survival rate for patients with depth of inversion of greater than or equal to 1.5 mm was 67%, compared with 93% for those with depth of invasion of less than 1.5 mm (P = .009). No other variable, including age, sex, tobacco use, alcohol use, the presence of carcinoma-in-situ, histologic grade, lymphocytic infiltration, or muscularis mucosae invasion, was associated with cancer progression,
   Conclusion: The depth of invasion in the TURB specimens, measured with a micrometer, is predictive of cancer progression in patients with stage T1 bladder carcinoma. (C) 1999 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB Purpose: We describe treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) among men participating in the Olmsted County study of urinary symptoms and health status among men during 10,000 person-years of followup.
   Materials and Methods: A cohort of 2,115 men 40 to 79 years old was randomly selected from an enumeration of the Olmsted County, Minnesota population (55% response rate). Participants completed a previously validated baseline questionnaire to assess symptom severity and voided into a portable urometer. A 25% random subsample underwent transrectal sonographic imaging of the prostate to determine prostate volume and measurement of serum prostate specific antigen. Followup included retrospective review of community medical records and completion of a biennial questionnaire to determine the occurrence of medical and surgical treatment for BPH in the subsequent 6 years.
   Results: During more than 10,000 person-years of followup 167 men were treated, yielding an overall incidence of 16.0/1,000 person-years. There was a strong age related increase in risk of any treatment from 3.3/1,000 person-years for men 40 to 49 years old to more than 30/1,000 person-years for those 70 years old or older. Men with moderate to severe symptoms (American Urological Association symptom index greater than 7), depressed peak urinary flow rates (less than 12 ml. per second), enlarged prostate (greater than 30 ml.) or elevated serum prostate specific antigen (1.4 ng./ml. or greater) had about 4 times the risk of BPH treatment than those who did not. After adjustment for all measures simultaneously an enlarged prostate (hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1, 4.7), depressed peak flow rate (hazard ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.4, 5.3) and moderate to severe symptoms (hazard ratio 5.3, 95% CI 2.5, 11.1) at baseline each independently predicted subsequent treatment.
   Conclusions: While repeat contact and availability of urological measurements during the study period may have influenced treatment decisions in this cohort, the data demonstrate that treatment is common in elderly men with nearly 1 in 4 receiving treatment in the eighth decade of life. Furthermore, these data suggest that men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms, impaired flow rates or enlarged prostates are more likely to undergo treatment, with increases in risk of similar magnitude to those associated with adverse outcomes, such as acute urinary retention.

CT ILSI Europe Workshop on the Significance of Excursions of Intake above
   the Acceotable Daily Intake (ADI)
CY APR 21-23, 1998

SP ILSI Europe Acceptable Daily Intake Task Force
AB Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been allocated an "ADI not specified" by the JECFA, which indicates that no toxicological concerns arise associated with its use as a food additive in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP) and for that reason it is not necessary to allocate a numerical ADI. The question in this case, then, is not whether excursions above a numerical ADI might occur but whether high peak intakes might arise which could invalidate the assumption of absence of hazard. Two major issues have arisen in relation to high intakes of MSG: (1) What is the significance of neural damage (focal necrosis in the hypothalamus) seen following high parenteral or intragastric doses of MSG to neonatal animals and is this a particular risk for children? (2) What is the role of MSG in "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome" (flushing, tightness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, etc.) following consumption of Chinese foods? In relation to the first issue, human studies have been crucial in resolving the question. The threshold blood levels associated with neuronal damage in the mouse (most sensitive species) are 100-130 mu mol/dl in neonates rising to >630 mu mol/dl in adult animals. In humans, plasma levels of this magnitude have not been recorded even after bolus doses of 150 mg/kg body wt (ca. 10 g for an adult). Additionally, studies in infants have confirmed that the human baby can metabolize glutamate as effectively as adults. It is concluded that blood levels of glutamate + aspartate do not rise significantly even after abuse doses and babies are no more at risk than adults. Intake levels associated with the use of MSG as a food additive and natural levels of glutamic acid in foods therefore do not raise toxicological concerns even at high peak levels of intake. It is not envisaged that use of MSG according to GMP requires the allocation of a numerical ADI. With regard to the second issue, controlled double-blind crossover studies have failed to establish a relationship between Chinese Restaurant Syndrome and ingestion of MSG, even in individuals reportedly sensitive to Chinese meals, and MSG did not provoke bronchoconstriction in asthmatics. Thus, high usage of MSG in ethnic cuisines does not represent a situation in which intakes might achieve unsafe levels, even among individuals claiming idiosyncratic intolerance of such foods. In the light of the toxicological studies, the human metabolic studies in neonates and adults, and the physiological and nutritional role of glutamic acid and the fact that food additive use does not markedly increase the total dietary burden, no foreseeable circumstances arise in which intakes would be such as to invalidate the appropriateness of allocating an ADI not specified to MSG.

AB Trichothecene mycotoxins in animal. feed and human food can cause fatalities in livestock and disease in humans. In addition, these toxins are suspected chemical warfare agents. Therefore, development of a simple and sensitive method for the screening of trichothecenes is important to prevent economic loss and health hazards. A simple and inexpensive method for the detection of type-B trichothecene mycotoxins has been developed in our laboratory. By hydrolyzing the toxin under basic conditions at 80 degrees C for 1 h it is possible to detect the toxin with simple electrochemical techniques. Deoxynivalenol (DON), commonly known as vomitoxin, was used as a representative compound for type-B trichothecenes in this detection scheme. The detection limit for DON using our procedures was determined to be 9.1 mu M in solution, corresponding to 0.24 ppm in a 25-g grain sample if the final extraction volume is 2.2 mi, The linear dynamic detection range was determined to be from 0.32 ppm to greater than 32 ppm. In addition to standard solutions, this method was used on rice samples spiked with DON, It was demonstrated that there is no electrochemical interference from rice extract and that 1 ppm of DON in rice samples can be quantified. This method may be ideal for toxin screening in animal feeds or in runoff from sites that produce the compounds as chemical warfare agents. Since the active moiety its DON is common to virtually all type-B trichothecenes, our approach may be ideal for type-specific screening.

AB Objective: To evaluate the influence of immunological and virological markers on clinical outcome in patients receiving their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen.
   Design and methods: Observational study of 585 patients initiating HAART in a clinical setting. Clinical failure was defined-as the occurrence of new or recurrent AIDS-defining events or death, and was analysed by means of intention-to-treat, univariate and multivariate analyses. An adjusted Cox regression model was used to evaluate the effect of 3-month CD4 cell counts on clinical outcome.
   Results: Clinical failure occurred in 55 patients (9.4%) during a median follow-up of 483 days (range 33-1334 days): 45 new AIDS-defining events (ADEs) in 38, ADE recurrence in six, and death in 11. Twenty-four of the 45 new ADEs (53.4%) occurred during the first 3 months of HAART, and 11 of 45 (24.4%) in the presence of CD4 cell counts >200 x 10(6) cells/l. The mean (median, range) CD4 counts were 144 x 10(6) cells/l (128, 4-529) in patients with and 322 x 10(6) cells/l (288, 14-1162) in patients without clinical failure (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the proportion of patients with mean CD4 cell counts < 200 x 10(6) cells/l was higher in those experiencing subsequent clinical failure (chi(2) test: 26.75; P < 0.00001). Multivariate analysis showed that baseline CD4 cell counts < 50 x 10(6) cells/l and AIDS at enrolment predicted failure; after adjusting for 3-month CD4 cell counts, this marker was the only one independently associated with clinical failure (hazard risk, 4.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-16.47).
   Conclusions: The 3-month immunological response is a reliable predictor of long term clinical outcome. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB Background: Total homocysteine levels are associated with arteriosclerotic outcomes.
   Objective: To determine whether total homocysteine levels predict incident stroke in elderly persons.
   Design: Prospective population-based cohort study with 9.9 years of follow-up.
   Setting: Framingham, Massachusetts.
   Patients: 1947 Framingham Study participants (1158 women and 789 men; mean age +/- SD, 70 +/- 7 years).
   Measurements: Baseline total homocysteine levels and 9.9-year stroke incidence.
   Results: The quartiles of nonfasting total homocysteine levels were as follows: quartile 1, 4.13 to 9.25 mu mol/L; quartile 2, 9.26 to 11.43 mu mol/L; quartite 3, 11.44 to 14.23 mu mol/L; quartile 4, 14.24 to 219.84 mu mol/L. During follow-up, 165 incident strokes occurred. In proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and history of atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease, relative risk (RR) estimates comparing quartile 1 with the other three quartiles were as follows: quartile 2 compared with quartile 1-RR, 1.32 (95% CI, 0.81 to 2.14); quartile 3 compared with quartile 1-RR, 1.44 (CI, 0.89 to 2.34); quartile 4 compared with quartile 1-RR, 1.82 (CI, 1.14 to 2.91). The linear trend across the quartiles was significant (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Nonfasting total homocysteine levels are an independent risk factor for incident stroke in elderly persons.

AB This paper presents the results of field trials of a prototype lunar rover traveling over natural terrain under safeguarded teleoperation control. Both the rover and the safeguarding approach have been used in previous work. The original contributions of this paper are the development and integration of a laser hazard detection system, and extensive field testing of the overall system. The laser system, which complements an existing stereo vision system, is based on a line-scanning laser ranger viewing the area 1 meter in front of the rover. The laser system has demonstrated excellent performance: zero misses and few false alarms operating at 4 Hz. The overall safeguarding system guided the rover 43 km over lunar analogue terrain with 0.8 failures per kilometer.

AB In this report, we use new patient data to test three popular models developed to predict the outcome of definitive radiation therapy, The data come from 240 men with localized prostate cancer and who were treated with definitive radiation therapy at a community hospital. All three models tested were based on the three commonly available variables of pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, and tumor stage, and we used the Cox proportional hazards model and the logistic regression model to relate these variables to outcome. We discovered that in our data, the optimal way to use pretreatment PSA was as natural log(PSA), the optimal way to use T stage was in three categories: T-1 and T-2, T-3, and T-4, and that the optimal use of Gleason score was as <7 versus greater than or equal to 7. Nevertheless, models confined to the optimal use of these three variables leave much uncertainty about important outcomes, such as the probability of relapse within 5 years.

DT Article
AB To support the prevention, management, analysis or mitigation of natural hazards, users need rapid access to the latest remote-sensing data for the area concerned, ESA's internal Earth Watching project has also shown the strategic value of access to historical data for 'change detection' in such critical situations. A novel system has therefore been set-up at ESRIN, for both internal and external use, to support activities requiring the fast availability of archived remotely sensed data. The new ImageDB server provides instantaneous on-line access both to specific collections of quick-looks and full images.
   The project was started at the end of 1998, in cooperation with the company Web Bridges (I) for the sewer design and development. The implementation proceeded in steps, with releases of intermediate functions as soon as available. The first release was opened on-line in May 1999, providing access, through DESCW*-supported inventory searches and quick-look downloads, to 100 geocoded (GEC) products over the major European rivers, generated from data acquired by ERS-2 during the period July-September 1998.

DT Article
AB In this essay we consider the problems of risks and governance in the light of three well-known examples: the 'Seveso' accident involving dioxin; the BSE epidemic; and the licensing of genetically modified maize. These form a natural progression, from hazards that are 'classical', manageable mainly by 'applied science', to those that are totally post-normal. The new hazards typified by genetically modified maize, but including many others such as untested toxic chemicals, pose serious challenges to governance. The erosion of trust in the established institutions could lead to paralysis of innovation and also of government. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper highlights the broad hydrogeomorphological characteristics of the Cox's Bazar coast of Bangladesh. High resolution air photographs of 1:20000 were interpreted for delineating the geomorphological boundaries of the coastal plain. Sediment samples collected from the each geomorphic units were analysed to understand the sedimentary environments. Based on the location and characteristics of the geomorphic units and types and spatial distribution of sediments, evolutionary history of the coast was developed. Finally, a weighted matrix was prepared for assessing the exposure of the geomorphic units to geohazards e.g., storm surges, flash flood. The study reveals that the coast of Cobs Bazar has landforms of two distinct origin: fluvial and marine. Beach and dunes are the two most prominent features of the coast. The sedimentation and its evolutionary sequence of the coastal plain indicates an infiling of a sheltered basin within a relatively high wave and micro- to mesa tidal conditions. Cyclonic storms/storm surges appears to be the most common geohazard for most of the landform types of the area. Floodplain with most of the infrastructural investments would need protection from storm surge and Bash flood.

AB We consider Bayesian methods for right-censored survival data for populations with a surviving (cure) fraction. We propose a model that is quite different from the standard mixture model for cure rates. We provide a natural motivation and interpretation of the model and derive several novel properties of it. First, we show that the model has a proportional hazards structure, with the covariates depending naturally on the cure rate. Second, we derive several properties of the hazard function for the proposed model and establish mathematical relationships with the mixture model for cure rates. Prior elicitation is discussed in detail, and classes of noninformative and informative prior distributions are proposed. Several theoretical properties of the proposed priors and resulting posteriors are derived, and comparisons are made to the standard mixture model. A real dataset from a melanoma clinical trial is discussed in detail.

AB Background: The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is increased severalfold in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV). Human herpesvirus 8 (HHVS) has also been implicated in KS. We investigated several factors that may determine the onset of KS, particularly HHVS infection in individuals after becoming seropositive for HIV. Methods: We studied 366 individuals belonging to different HIV-exposure categories (i.e., homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and heterosexual contact) for whom a negative HIV serologic test and then a positive HIV serologic test were available within a 2-year period. HHV8 antibody testing was performed by use of an immunofluorescence assay on the first serum sample available after the first positive HIV test. Actuarial rates of progression of KS and of other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining diseases were estimated by use of time-to-event statistical methods. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Twenty-one of the 366 study participants developed AIDS-related KS, and 83 developed AIDS without KS. One hundred forty (38.3%) participants had detectable anti-HHV8 antibodies. The actuarial progression rate to KS among persons co-infected with HIV/HHV8 was nearly 30% by 10 years after HIV seroconversion. Increasing HHV8 antibody titers increased the risk of developing KS (for seronegative versus highest titer [1 :125 serum dilution], adjusted relative hazard [RH] = 51.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.08-441.33) but not of other AIDS-defining diseases (adjusted RH = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.72-1.80). HHV8-seropositive homosexual men compared with HHV8-seropositive participants from other HIV-exposure categories showed an increased risk of KS that approached statistical significance (adjusted RH = 6.93; 95% CI = 0.88-54.84). Conclusions: Approximately one third of individuals coinfected with HIV/HHV8 developed KS within 10 years after HIV seroconversion. Progression to KS increased with time after HIV seroconversion, Higher antibody titers to HHV8 appear to be related to faster progression to KS but not to other AIDS-defining diseases.

DT Article
DE Furnas volcano; Sao Miguel; Azores; loss reduction; human vulnerability;
   social impact; economic impact; health impact
AB The need to examine the vulnerability of people to natural hazards, in addition to the long-established requirement to study extreme events of nature, is being increasingly recognised within disaster research. Following a discussion of the nature of human vulnerability, we propose a framework for its analysis within the context of volcanic activity and we exemplify our approach by a detailed study of Furnas, a village located at the centre of a volcano with the same name on the island of Sao Miguel in the Azores. The methods used included in-depth interviews with permanent residents (n = 50), analysis of census records and an examination of the socio-economic history of the town. The vulnerability of an individual to volcanic hazards involves a complex interaction of elements which, in addition to the usual factors taken into account in programmes of hazard reduction (e.g., the nature of the physical threat, location and economic situation), also comprises his or her social context and a number of physiological and psychological considerations. It is argued, further, that both generally and in the case of Furnas, the root causes of vulnerability lie in the history and development of society. Individual decision making is fundamental but takes place within and cannot be separated from this social context. Vulnerability analysis allows the identification of points where intervention may be successful in reducing the likelihood of suffering in a society. It avoids the problem of people's unexpected reactions to invention leading to a changing or even increasing level of vulnerability, by studying society rather than just one aspect of volcanic hazard in isolation.

ID SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB A comparison of the neoclassical and the social economics paradigms, showing that the explicit inclusion of values enhances the explanatory value of social economics. This is illustrated by using literary examples to explain the difficulty the competitive model has in providing analyses and solutions for modern problems of product safety, natural resource overexploitation, urban congestion, and stakeholder rights.

AB Given recent reports suggesting that natural and synthetic steroids (namely, oestradiol, oestrone and ethynylestradiol) may be present in sewage effluent at levels which may impact on fish, it is pertinent to extend the ecological hazard evaluation for such substances to aquatic invertebrates. Studies have therefore been undertaken to address whether 17 beta-oestradiol, oestrone and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol can inhibit survival, development or reproductive output in Tisbe battagliai (Crustacea, Copepoda, Harpacticoida). This sexually reproducing species was selected since it is representative of a widespread group of aquatic Crustacea, is sensitive to environmental contaminants and is highly amenable to laboratory life-cycle studies. Newly released (< 24 h old) T. battagliai nauplii were exposed to individual steroids dissolved in sea water (using the ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone, as a positive control) and effects monitored in terms of survival, development and sex ratio after 10 days at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Adult males and females were then paired and exposures continued to investigate effects on reproductive output (21 days total exposure). In summary, the lowest 21 day No Observed Effect Concentrations based on these life-cycle parameters were: 20-hydroxyecdysone: 8.7 mu g.l(-1); oestrone: greater than or equal to 100 mu g.l(-1); 17 beta-oestradiol: greater than or equal to 100 mu g.l(-1); and 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol: greater than or equal to 100 mu g.l(-1) (all. based on nominal concentrations). These data are relevant for the development of an ecological risk assessment for oestrogenic steroids in the aquatic environment and should be extended to other invertebrate groups. As novel analytical techniques allow, future bioassay studies should be ideally supported by steroid analyses wherever possible. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background-The association between elevated blood triglyceride levels and subsequent mortality risk in patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) has been investigated rarely. The aim of the present study was to investigate this association.
   Methods and Results-We evaluated mortality over a mean follow-up time of 5.1 years among 9033 male and 2499 female CHD patients who were screened for participation in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. A stepwise increase in mortality with increasing serum triglyceride levels was observed in patients with desirable or elevated serum total cholesterol levels and in patients with either desirable or abnormally low HDL cholesterol levels. Multivariate adjustment for factors other than HDL cholesterol yielded a slightly increased adjusted mortality risk with a 1-natural-log-unit elevation of triglyceride levels in men (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.30) and women (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.88), Excess covariate-adjusted risk was noted among patients with elevated total and LDL cholesterol and in women with HDL cholesterol levels >45 mg/dL. After additional adjustment for HDL cholesterol, the risk of mortality with a 1-natural-log-unit elevation of triglycerides declined in men (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.26) and in women (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.50). A trend for increased mortality risk remained in patients with elevated total and LDL cholesterol and in women with HDL cholesterol >45 mg/dL.
   Conclusions-Elevated triglyceride levels were associated with a small, independent increased mortality risk in CHD patients. This risk may be increased among subgroups of patients with elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels.

AB African and Asian mountains and highlands are ecoregions of particular importance for sustainable development due to their intensive land-use systems, their generally low economic productivity and integration, and the increasing rates of land degradation and mountain hazards. Opportunities for sustainable development exist, if ways to overcome land degradation can be found. The percentage of people who are engaged in subsistence agriculture can be reduced in favor of the secondary and tertiary sectors, protected areas can be better managed, access to remote areas improved, mountain waters utilized in a more integrated highland-lowland interaction, and mechanisms to manage conflicts developed. Research in support of sustainable development needs to focus on transdisciplinary approaches in order to develop appropriate technologies, improve land-management systems, and most importantly, create an enabling institutional environment. international cooperation is an essential tool for exchanging and communicating successful experiences from the local level to regional levels.

AB The toxicity of arsenate (As(V)), arsenite (As(III)), monomethylarsonic (MMAA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA) to natural algal assemblages from lakes within the Aberjona watershed having different arsenic concentrations was determined by a short-term photosynthesis assay. Total arsenic concentrations in the studied lakes ranged from 1.5 x 10(-8) to 1.9 x 10(-7) M. The toxicity of the arsenic species generally decreased in the order of As(V) > As(III) > DMAA for all lakes. Toxicity of As(V) to phytoplankton collected from relatively unpolluted Horn Pond was highest (EC50 = 3 x 10(-7) M), whereas algae from the polluted Upper Mystic Lake were more tolerant (EC50 = 6 x 10(-6) M) and those from Halls Brook Storage Area, a highly contaminated lake, were tolerant to As(V) up to 10(-3) M. The sensitivities of the different algal communities to As(III) were similar (EC50 value = 5 x 10(-5) M). MMAA was as toxic as As(V) in the unpolluted system (Horn Pond), However, photosynthesis of lakes from contaminated lakes was slightly enhanced by MMAA. DMAA concentration in the range of 10(-5) M was strongly enhancing to short-term CO2 fixation rates of all phytoplankton assemblages; activity increased up to 600% compared to control values. Algae from contaminated sites appear to have adapted to higher As(V) and MMAA concentrations, whereas algae from the unpolluted lake remained sensitive. As(III) represented no chemical stress to the algal assemblages as measured by the assays. The role of DMAA is unclear. Considering the concentrations and the toxicity of As(V) and MMAA in unpolluted systems, one must conclude that As(V) is the major arsenical environmental hazard, however, MMAA might also pose a potential risk in unpolluted systems.

ID NATURAL RECOVERY; PROBLEM DRINKERS; DRINKING
AB Resolution of alcohol problems without formal treatment or participation in support groups was studied using a grounded theory approach. Thirteen former problem drinkers and their close associates were interviewed, and verbatim transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory methods. The core of self-resolving alcohol problems involves investing and/or reinvesting in self to gain or regain the essence of who or what one wants to be. Self-resolvers tend to independently change for their own benefit rather than the benefit of others, and personal resources may promote or delay the process. The effort required to self-resolve drinking problems varies, and close associates tend to be minority investors in the process. Input from health-care providers regarding the health-related hazards of drinking are largely ignored because threats to who or what one wants to be are perceived as more significant. As such, clinical interventions should emphasize personally relevant threats to self versus focusing solely on the physical consequences of alcohol abuse. Copyright (C) 1999 by W.B..

AB BACKGROUND. This report is an 8-year update of the authors' previous findings from National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) Protocol B-17, which relates to the influence of pathologic characteristics on the natural history and treatment of intraductal carcinoma (DCIS).
   METHODS. Nine pathologic features observed in a pathologic subset of 623 of 814 evaluable women enrolled in this randomized clinical trial were assessed for their role in the prediction of second ipsilateral breast tumors (IBT), other events, and selection of breast irradiation (XRT) following lumpectomy.
   RESULTS. The frequency of subsequent IBT was reduced from 31% to 13% (P = 0.0001) by XRT. The average annual hazard rates for IBT were reduced by XRT for all pathologic features examined. Four characteristics were individually noted to be significantly related to IBT, but only moderate-to-marked and absent-to-slight comedo necrosis were found to be independent high and low risk predictors, respectively, for such an event in patients of both treatment groups. XRT effected a 7% absolute reduction at. 8 years in the low risk group. Despite a relatively high incidence (approximate to 40%) of BET consisting of invasive cancer, mortality due to breast carcinoma after DCIS for the entire cohort was found to be only 1.6% at 8 years.
   CONCLUSIONS. The degree of comedo necrosis in patients with DCIS appears to be sufficient for discriminating between high and low risks for IBT following lumpectomy for DCIS. Although margin status, unlike in our previous report, was found to have only a slight or borderline influence on the frequency of IBT at 8 years, excision of DCIS with free margins is advised. The low risk group exhibits a statistically significant reduction of IBT from XRT. The decision to forgo XRT in the treatment of this singular subset of patients would appear to depend on clinical considerations and the input of informed patients rather than being standard practice.

AB We compare mortality differences for specific and general categories of occupations using a national cohort of approximately 380,000 persons aged 25-64 from the U.S. National Longitudinal Mortality Study. Based on comparisons of relative risk obtained from Cox proportional-hazards model analyses, higher risk is observed in moving across the occupational spectrum from the technical, highly skilled occupations to less-skilled and generally more labor-intensive occupations. Mortality differences obtained for social status groups of specific occupations are almost completely accounted for by adjustments for income and education. Important differences are shown to exist for selected specific occupations beyond those accounted for by social status, income, and education. Highrisk specific occupations include taxi drivers, cooks, longshoremen, and transportation operatives. Low-risk specific occupations include lawyers, natural scientists, teachers, farmers, and a variety of engineers.

AB Disasters occur from the impact of a variety of natural and technological hazards. This paper explores the kind of disasters we can expect in the coming century, the challenges they present to human societies, and suggests a few future coping strategies. it argues that some future disasters will occur as a result of slow onset of hazards such as Global Warming or Ozone Layer Damage. Other disasters will happen more rapidly, emerging from such human actions as terrorism and resource wars. We can expect future disasters to be increasingly large in scale due to the complexity of human society and the ever growing size and density of urban regions and the built environment.

AB Although British Columbia experiences many natural hazards, there is as yet no unified policy to promote natural hazard management in the province. The problem is not in the quantity and quality of geoscience assessment of natural hazards, but instead, it is suggested, in the isolation of that work from broader risk perspectives and in the lack of clarity of division of responsibilities between various levels of government. The example of recent changes in perception of the terrain stability problem illustrates how natural hazard problems are driven by social and political priorities rather than by geoscience priorities.

AB Purpose: Axillary lymph node status is the single most important prognostic variable in the management of patients with primary breast cancer. yet, it is not known whether metastasis ta the axillary nodes is simply a time-dependent variable or also a marker for a more aggressive tumor phenotype, The purpose of this study was to determine whether nodal status at initial diagnosis predicts outcome after relapse and therefore also serves as a marker of breast cancer phenotype,
   Patients and Methods: Survival experience after first relapse in 1,696 primary breast cancer cases was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The following explanatory variables and their first-order interactions were considered: number of axillary lymph nodes involved (zero v one to three v four or more), hormone receptor status (any estrogen receptor [ER] negativity v ER negativity/progesterone receptor positivity v other ER positivity), primary tumor size (< 2 cm v 2 to 5 cm v > 5 cm), site of relapse (locoregional v distant), disease-free interval (< 1.5 years v 1,5 to 3 years v > 3 years), adjuvant endocrine therapy (none v any), adjuvant chemotherapy (none v any), and menopausal status (pre-, peri-, or postmenopausal).
   Results: Axillary lymph node status, site of relapse, and hormone receptor status were all highly significant as main effects in the model. After adjustment for other variables, disease-free interval alone was only modestly significant but interacted with nodal status, After disease-free interval, hormone receptor status, and site of relapse were accounted for, survival after relapse was poorer in node-positive cases, when compared with node-negative cases. The hazard ratios for patients with one to three and four or more involved nodes were 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 1.9) and 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.4), respectively.
   Conclusion: Patients with four or more involved nodes at initial diagnosis have a significantly worse outcome after relapse than node-negative cases, regardless of the duration of the disease-free interval. We conclude that nodal metastasis is not only a marker of diagnosis at a later point in the natural history of breast cancer but also a marker of an aggressive phenotype.

AB The paper discusses the problem of identifiability for two versions of a two-stage model of carcinogenesis recently introduced by Yakovlev and Polig. In this model, cell killing is allowed to compete with tumor promotion. In the first version of the Yakovlev-Polig model, which is referred to as Model 1, cell killing starts immediately after a carcinogen is administered. In the second version, called Model 2, it is assumed that a cell may be killed only after the process of initiation has been completed. The two versions of the Yakovlev-Polig model suggest explicit formulas for the distribution of time to tumor onset (that is, appearance of the first malignant clonogenic cell) counted from the initial moment of the exposure to a carcinogen. A model of carcinogenesis is identifiable if the set of all model parameters is uniquely determined by the distribution of time to tumor onset. It is shown that, under a natural necessary condition of overlap of supports of the dose-rate function h and the promotion time distributions from a family F, Model 1 is identifiable in the family F for many practically important functions h. In particular, this is the case for a simple model of spontaneous carcinogenesis (h = 1) and for a class of piecewise constant dose-rate functions h with arbitrary family F. Also, this holds for the family of gamma distributions and h supported on an interval and non-vanishing in the interior of this interval. More restrictions need to be imposed on the dose-rate function and the family of promotion time distributions for Model 2 to be identifiable. In particular, for h = 1, Model 2 turns out to be non-identifiable even in the family of gamma distributions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB nWe re-examine and summarize what is now possible in predicting earthquakes, what might be accomplished (and hence might be possible in the next few decades) and what types of predictions appear to be inherently impossible based on our understanding of earthquakes as complex phenomena. We take predictions to involve a variety of time scales from seconds to a few decades. Earthquake warnings and their possible societal uses differ for those time scales. Earthquake prediction should not be equated solely with short-term prediction-those with time scales of hours to weeks-nor should it be assumed that only short-term warnings either are or might be useful to society. A variety of "consumers" or stakeholders are likely to take different mitigation measures in response to each type of prediction. A series of recent articles in scientific literature and the media claim that earthquakes cannot be predicted and that exceedingly high accuracy is needed for predictions to be of societal value, We dispute a number of their key assumptions and conclusions, including their claim that earthquakes represent a self-organized critical (SOC) phenomenon, implying a system maintained on the edge of chaotic behavior at all times. We think this is correct but only in an uninteresting way, that is on global or continental scales. The stresses in the regions surrounding the rupture zones of individual large earthquakes are reduced below a SOC state at the times of those events and remain so for long periods. As stresses are slowly re-established by tectonic loading, a region approaches a SOC state during the last part of the cycle of large earthquakes. The presence of that state can be regarded as a long-term precursor rather than as an impediment to prediction. We examine other natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, severe storms and climate change that, like earthquakes, are also examples of complex processes, each with its own predictable, possibly predictable and inherently unpredictable elements. That a natural system is complex does not mean that predictions are not possible for some spatial. temporal and size regimes. Long-term, and perhaps intermediate-term, predictions for large earthquakes appear to be possible for very active fault segments. Predicting large events more than one cycle into the future appears to be inherently difficult, if not impossible since much of the nonlinearity in the earthquake process occurs at or near the time of large events. Progress in earthquake science and prediction over the next few decades will require increased monitoring in several active areas.

AB The north part of Lantau Island is undergoing rapid development following construction of the new airport at Chek Lap Kok. This development, primarily on reclaimed land, is adjacent to a range of steeply sloping hills that experience levels of annual rain in excess of 2500 mm. Rainfall induced landslides on this steeply sloping natural terrain are potential hazards to developments down slope. Landslides on these natural slopes resulting from two major rainstorms in 1992 and 1993 were studied to determine their characteristics and define the geomorphological factors influencing their debris trails. These data were compared with the aerial photographic record of landslide scars within the same catchment over the period 1945-1995 to determine the potential hazard from natural terrain landslides to downslope development.
   The limited data set indicates that channelized debris flows which produce long debris trails pose the greatest hazard potential to downslope development. Factors influencing debris how paths and deposition zones were assessed from a geomorphological study of the catchment to define criteria for preliminary hazard zoning of downslope developments.

AB Background: There is evidence that ovarian steroids influence both reproductive aging and neural development. Objective: We investigated the relationship between menopause and lifetime cognitive function in a prospective birth cohort study. Methods: Participants were 1,572 women enrolled in the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (the British 1946 birth cohort). By age 50, 245 women were postmenopausal, 724 were pre- or perimenopausal, 288 had had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and 291 women had started taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) before their menopause. The remaining 24 women, for various reasons, could not be classified into any of these groups. We investigated the association between cognitive function at ages 8, 11, 15, 26, and 43 years and menopause timing using Cox proportional hazard models, censoring for hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, and initially for HRT use. The effect of including HRT use before menopause as an additional outcome was investigated using a competing risks analysis. Results: Higher cognitive scores were associated with later menopause. The effect was strongest in childhood. This finding could not be explained by a variety of potential confounders, including early social background, physical development, education, adult social class, parity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Childhood cognitive function is related to timing of the natural menopause. Both may be influenced by ovarian steroids across the life-span.

AB Around 40% of human cancers may relate to dietary factors, including both exogenous and endogenous mutagens. Of exogenous factors, alcohol, certain metals and certain pesticides (both naturally produced or manufactured by the chemical industry), N-nitroso compounds, heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are all probable human carcinogens. Despite current negative publicity, genetic engineering appears to be a more precise process and no more likely to lead to cancer risks than conventional breeding processes. Many traditional assessments of cancer hazard from endogenous or exogenous chemicals ignore the presence of modifying factors in the human diet. For example, dietary fat and dietary fibre probably either enhance or protect against cancer, depending upon the exact amounts and chemical nature of the fat or fibre. Considerable numbers of other types of antimutagen/anticarcinogens have been identified, with varying modes of action. Additionally, there is an interaction of dietary factors with genetics. Epidemiology will always be important in assessing relative risks, but it is essential to continue developing more sensitive biomonitoring methodologies. It would be desirable to compare precise measures of individual exposure to dietary carcinogens with levels of oxidative damage and evidence of genotoxic effects in a given tissue. Such experimental approaches might be expected to lead to a better understanding of the interplay between different dietary factors and also between diet, heredity and the environment.

AB The 1993 Killari earthquake occurred in the central part of the Indian shield, an area generally believed to be of low seismogenic potential. This rare event provided an opportunity to understand the seismogenesis within the shield regions. Trench excavations in the rupture zone as well as other natural exposures in the vicinity of the epicentral region of the Killari earthquake indicate episodic activity separated by long periods. Deep drilling in the epicentral area recorded a maximum of similar to 6 m of slip in the deeper strata (Gupta et al., 1998a). Assuming an average of about 1 m slip for a moderate earthquake, as revealed by the 1993 event, accumulated slip indicates at least six moderate earthquakes at Killari. While the timing of the penultimate event may work out to be hundreds of thousands of years or more, evidence for at least one moderate earthquake similar to 1500 yr ago was obtained from Ter, about 40 km northwest of Killari. Observations at Killari and Ter indicate the localization of deformation along a preexisting shear zone that are being reactivated in the current stress field. Because of factors like low background seismicity, long interseismic intervals and smaller ruptures compounded by low preservation of surface exposures, behaviour of seismogenic structures in the shield regions may appear to be random in space and time. Observations presented in this paper suggest that the perceived randomness probably holds only for individual patches in the current time window. Other parts of the seismogenic fault may behave independently, showing a different temporal pattern. Comprehensive investigations of the entire structure are needed to understand the long-term behaviour of such faults, and thereby improve the seismic hazard assessment in the cratonic interiors.

AB Background-The effect of hypertension on mortality was examined in 5284 Pima Indians, 1698 of whom had type 2 diabetes at baseline or developed it during follow-up.
   Methods and Results-During a median follow-up of 12.2 years (range, 0.01 to 24.8 years), 470 nondiabetic subjects and 488 diabetic subjects died. In the nondiabetic subjects, 45 of the deaths were due to cardiovascular disease, 208 to other natural causes, and 217 to external causes; in the diabetic subjects, 106 of the deaths were due to cardiovascular disease, 85 to diabetic nephropathy, 226 to other natural causes, and 71 to external causes. In the nondiabetic subjects, after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and serum cholesterol concentration in a proportional hazards model, hypertension predicted death from cardiovascular disease (death rate ratio [DRR]= 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.6; P = 0.003). In the diabetic subjects, after additional adjustment for duration of diabetes, plasma glucose concentration, and proteinuria, hypertension strongly predicted deaths from diabetic nephropathy (DRR = 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7 to 7.2; P < 0.001), but it had little effect on deaths from cardiovascular disease (DRR = 1.4; 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.3; P = 0.15).
   Conclusions-We propose that the weak relationship between hypertension and cardiovascular disease in diabetic Pima Indians is not because of a diminished effect of hypertension on cardiovascular disease in diabetes, but because of a relatively greater effect of hypertension on the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Factors-that may account for this finding in Pima Indians include a younger age at onset of type 2 diabetes, a low frequency of heavy smoking, favorable lipoprotein profiles and, possibly, enhanced susceptibility to renal disease.

ID HAZARD; FUTURE
AB The Baro-Akobo river basin in southwestern Ethiopia is rich in freshwater resources. In 1984, the government initiated resettlement activities in the basin in anticipation of exploiting the fertile soil and abundant water resources. In order to investigate the causes of post-resettlement floods and their effects on the natural resources, agricultural land and human settlements, field studies and hydrological observations were made during the years 1986, 1988, 1991, 1991 and 1996. It was found that agriculture, both cultivation and grazing land, and human settlements are affected by adverse floods. Abnormal floods in the area are associated with two natural factors-overflow of river banks beyond the normally flooded zones and rainfall storms and their subsequent passage through the drainage system; and also human interference within the catchment due to the absence of proper land use planning. The rapidly growing population can neither divert water to the agricultural fields during drought nor prevent the floods from eroding the region's soil resources. In addition, drinking water of appropriate quantity or quality is not available. It is suggested that environmentally sustainable land use systems and proper utilization of rivers, the introduction of flood amelioration strategies and flood forecasting are all urgently needed for the lower Baro-Akobo river basin.

AB Dong quai is a Chinese herbal supplement touted for treatment of menstrual cramping, irregular menses, and menopausal symptoms. Phytochemical analyses found it to consist of natural coumarin derivatives, as well as constituents possessing antithrombotic, antiarrhythmic, phototoxic, and carcinogenic effects. A 46-year-old African-American woman with atrial fibrillation stabilized on warfarin experienced a greater than 2-fold elevation in prothrombin time and international normalized ratio after taking dong quai concurrently for 4 weeks. No identifiable cause was ascertained for the increase except dong quai. The patient's coagulation values returned to acceptable levels 1 month after discontinuing the herb. One animal study suggests a pharmacodynamic interaction between the product and warfarin, but the true mechanism remains unknown. Practitioners should be aware of the possibility of such an interaction and should inform patients of potential hazards of taking the two together.

ID MORTALITY
AB Seafaring has long been recognised as one of the more dangerous occupations as it presents workplace hazards in a combination unknown in other occupations. Most studies on occupational hazards of seafarers have concentrated on nationally manned fleets operated out of Northern Europe. Recent studies on supply and demand of seafarers have highlighted the fact that international shipping is predominantly relying on internationally manned ships. This study examines the records of the Hong Kong Marine Department and presents an analysis of work-related fatalities in an internationally manned fleet. In a 10-year period, 123 deaths were recorded. The victims came from 13 different countries, with Hong Kong-resident seafarers forming only the fourth largest group. The biggest number of deaths was attributed to maritime disasters, followed by deaths due to illnesses, of which the biggest share was due to heart-related diseases. The third biggest cause of non-natural deaths was occupational accident. A review of the occupational accidents identified that personnel in deck occupations constituted the biggest group.

ID ALLERGEN
AB The allergy to natural rubber latex (NRL) proteins is a significant occupational health hazard. The elimination or reduction of the water-soluble proteins from finished NRL products is one approach aimed at decreasing further sensitization and reactions to these allergens. To achieve this goal, a reliable protein measurement method is required. Several published and widely used methods for protein measurement in finished NRL products demonstrate major inconsistencies in the quantification of extractable NRL proteins in, comparison to the Kjeldahl nitrogen assay and the gravimetrically determined reference. Multiple protein assays and several reference proteins were examined to determine the most suitable method for the quantitation of soluble NRL proteins. Among the reference proteins evaluated (BSA, BGG, and OA), OA was found to correlate best with gravimetrically determined levels of NRL proteins. Of the protein assays evaluated (Bradford, BCA, and Lowry), the modified Lowry assay demonstrated the best uniformity and a good correlation with the Kjeldahl nitrogen assay. The commercial Lowry assay kit, Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, was comparable to the laboratory-prepared reagents, and both demonstrated good sensitivity and precision. Altering a sample to reagent ratio increased the sensitivity of the test.

AB Evaporation ponds are becoming widely used by industry and agriculture for the disposal of brines as a result of increasingly strict regulations pertaining to off-site disposal methods. Migratory waterfowl and other wildlife can become reliant on such ponds, which can present biological hazards depending on the chemicals they receive. This study examined the algae, invertebrates, and chemistry of two large, hypersaline, industrial wastewater ponds near Phoenix, Arizona, at which waterfowl die-offs (primarily eared grebes, Podiceps nigricollis) were reported. The objectives were to determine what attracted birds to the ponds and whether the ponds were directly responsible for bird deaths. High levels of total salts and nitrate were detected in both ponds, but selenium (16 to 41 mu g/L) was the only potentially toxic element that reached levels of concern in the water column. Dominant algae were diatoms, Chaetoceros sp. and Nitzschia frustrulum (Krutz.) Grun. (up to 6.5 X 10(5) cells/mL), and cyanobacteria, Synechococcus Nageli 1849 (up to 8.8 x 10(6) cells/mL). These are normal components of hypersaline ponds and natural salt lakes. However, Chaetoceros levels were negatively correlated with salinity levels in the ponds and a species turnover is expected as ponds age, Primary aquatic fauna were Artemia franciscana (brine shrimp), a filter feeder that consumes algae. and Trichocorixa sp. (waterboatman), a carnivorous insect that presumably feeds on brine shrimp. Brine shrimp were the primary attractant of birds; they were harvested by numerous resident and migratory waterfowl. Selenium levels in brine shrimp (2 to 10 mg/kg) were above recommended levels for food chain organisms in aquatic ecosystems but were well below levels that can cause acute toxicity. Brine shrimp fed to zebra danios fish (Brachydanio refio) in a bioassay were nontoxic. As at other locations where grebe mortality events have been reported in recent Fears, the cause of death of birds visiting these evaporation ponds is unknown. Therefore, it is concluded that these ponds may not be directly toxic to visiting wildlife, but that evaporation ponds such as these are attractants for wildlife and may pose a long-term hazard through the accumulation of selenium in the food chain. Zero-discharge evaporation ponds may be useful as an interim solution to the brine disposal problem but do not represent a safe, permanent solution.

ID CHANNEL CATFISH PONDS; QUALITY; COPPER
AB The most common substances used in pond aquaculture are fertilizers and liming materials. Fertilizers are highly soluble and release nutrients that can cause eutrophication of natural waters. Fertilizers are also corrosive and some are highly explosive, so proper handling is necessary to prevent accidents. Some liming materials are caustic and can be hazardous to workers if proper precautions are not exercised. Liming materials do not cause environmental problems, and liming and inorganic fertilizer compounds do not present food safety concerns. An array of other substances is used less frequently in aquaculture including: oxidants, disinfectants, osmoregulators, algicides, coagulants, herbicides, and probiotics. These compounds or biological products quickly degrade or precipitate. They are not bioaccumulative and do not cause environmental perturbations in natural waters receiving pond effluents. Accidental spills of some substances could cause environmental damage. Most substances used in pond aquaculture to improve soil or water quality present Little or no risk to food safety. The use of human wastes in aquaculture or the contamination of aquaculture systems with agricultural or industrial pollution could result in product contamination and food safety concerns. Some substances pose safety risks to workers, explosion or fire hazards, or cause mild pollution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Up to 150 years of historical mean felt report data at 32 key Australian towns and cities were tested for completeness and converted to intensity recurrence intervals using extreme-value analysis, ii was found that the backward extrapolation of the mean modelled results of the most recent earthquake hazard study for these same localities fell within the 95% confidence interval derived from the regression of these historical data. Historical maximum felt intensities in the same towns and cities of Australia were used to show that damaging intensities of MM7 (or more) can be expected at susceptible sites at one (or more) of these centres, on average at least once every decade. Hence identification of the susceptible sites in each of these localities should be a priority.

AB A number of important misconceptions or fallacies stand in the way of a better understanding of the nation's flood problem. The fallacies are not universal, with many flood experts, decision makers, and sectors of the public escaping their seductive logic. But enough people do fall prey to these fallacies of floods so as to create obstacles to improved utilization of the lessons of experience. This paper uses three of these lessons to organize presentation of the nine fallacies:
   We know the wrong things about the nature of the problem.
   Fallacy 1: Flood frequencies are well understood.
   Fallacy 2: Damaging flooding in recent years is unprecedented because of `global warming'.
   Fallacy 3: Levees `prevent' damages.
   Fallacy 4: Flood forecasts are universally available.
   We don't know enough about why and with what intensity we should act.
   Fallacy 5: Societal vulnerability to floods is well understood.
   Fallacy 6: Data on flood casualties is a proxy for flood risk.
   Fallacy 7: Data on flood damages is a proxy for flood risk.
   We know enough about what might be done. Fallacy 8: Knowledge leads to action.
   Fallacy 9: The U.S. flood problem can be addressed without Federal leadership and support.
   The purpose of raising the fallacies in this paper is to contribute to a systematic definition of the nation's flood problem.

AB Governments often provide grants or low-interest loans to disaster victims. Yet these programmes have proven to be quite costly. In addition, questions have been raised about associated behavioural incentives. Conceptually, government disaster insurance programmes should be more efficient, consistent and equitable than ex post facto disaster relief in the form of grants and loans. Yet the performance of government disaster insurance programmes has been mixed, at best. This article reviews the history of US federal natural disaster assistance to individuals and concludes with a recommendation for a new government role in the provision of disaster insurance.

AB In this paper we synthesise past disaster research that addresses issues of race and ethnicity in the United States. Using an eight-stage typology to organise the findings, this literature review presents the results from a wide range of studies. The synthesis shows how various racial and ethnic groups perceive natural hazard risks and respond to warnings, how groups may be differentially affected both physically and psychologically, and how disaster effects vary by race and ethnicity during the periods of emergency response, recovery and reconstruction. We show that studies have important findings, many illustrating that racial and ethnic communities in the US are more vulnerable to natural disasters, due to factors such as language, housing patterns, building construction, community isolation and cultural insensitivities. By presenting these studies together, we are able to witness patterns of racial and ethnic inequalities that may be more difficult to see or interpret in individual studies that take place in one specific time and place. We conclude the review with policy and research recommendations.

AB The Child-Pugh classification is a simple, convenient prognostic measure in patients with liver cirrhosis. We investigated the relative role of the Child-Pugh classification and the Mayo model in the assessment of survival in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Of the 173 patients described in the original Mayo PSC natural history model, 147 patients had sufficient information in the medical record to allow computation of the Child-Pugh score. We used our most recent modification of the Mayo model to compute the risk score, based on patient's age, serum levels of bilirubin, albumin, and aspartate aminotransferase and history of variceal bleeding. Using the risk score (R), patients were divided into the low- (R < 0), intermediate- (0 less than or equal to R < 2), and high-risk (R greater than or equal to 2) groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates and proportional hazards analysis were used to evaluate the two prognostic models. Although there was a statistically significant correlation between the Child-Pugh and Mayo risk scores, two-thirds of the patients had a Child-Pugh score of 5 or 6 and a relatively wide range of risk scores (-1.1-4.3). The probability of survival for 7 years in patients in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was 92%, 74%, and 40% for Child-Pugh class A (n = 96) and 100%, 62%, and 28% for Child-Pugh class B patients (n = 44), respectively. There were only a small number (n 7) of Child-Pugh class C patients. In our age-adjusted multivariate analysis, each unit increase in the Mayo risk score was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in the risk of death (95% confidence interval: 1.8-3.4, P < .01), whereas Child-Pugh classification had no significant impact on survival (Child-Pugh B vs. A: risk ratio = 1.1 [95% confidence interval: 0.6-2.0]; Child-Pugh C versus A: risk ratio = 0.6 [95% confidence interval: 0.2-1.8]). In contrast to the Child-Pugh classification, which was developed for advanced liver cirrhosis, the Mayo model provides valid survival information, particularly in patients early in the course of PSC.

AB The Pench Valley coalfield extends over 32 km from west to east and is bounded by latitude 22 degrees 09'-22 degrees 24'N and longitude 78 degrees 38'30 "-79 degrees 0'E in the Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh (M.P.), India. This coalfield produces about 181,000 tons per month of non-coking grade coal from 17 mines. For an environmental hazard study, composite samples of coals from Eklehra, Rawanwara Khas, and Shivpuri open cast collieries were prepared for spectrographic analysis of Co, Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni and Pb. The concentrations of these elements range from 17-36.5 ppm, 66-105 ppm, 55-58.5 ppm, 745-935 ppm, 59-78 ppm, and 18.5-22 ppm, respectively. These elements become mobile with the exploitation of coal and on combustion contaminate farms, forests, and soils, and affect the quality of surface and ground waters, and finally, human health. The study of trace elements in natural waters suggests that concentration of the above elements are above the safety limit in a majority of samples and are hazardous to human health.

AB Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression might vary by geographical region due to differences in the spectrum of HIV-related illnesses and (access to) health care. Therefore, the effect of geographical region, next to the effect of other potential cofactors, on disease progression in 664 injecting drug users (IDU) with documented HIV seroconversion from eight cohorts in Europe was studied.
   Methods Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed to assess the effect of geographical region, other sociodemographics, drug use and repeated HIV exposure on progression from HIV seroconversion to immunosuppression, AIDS and death with AIDS. We considered the confounding effect of study-design related factors (e.g. setting of follow-up), and accounted for pre-AIDS death from natural causes by imputing when each endpoint would have occurred, had they not died without AIDS.
   Results Estimates of progression to AIDS and death with AIDS were substantially faster after taking pre-AIDS mortality into account. Median incubation time from seroconversion to the first CD4 count <200 cells/mu l was 7.7 years (95% CI : 7.1-8.3) and to AIDS 10.4 years (95% CI : 9.8-infinity). The 10-year survival was 70.3% (95% CI : 62.8-76.6). The relative hazards (RH) of AIDS for IDU from central and southern Europe compared with IDU from northern Europe was 1.9 (95% CI : 1.2-3.0) and 1.2 (95% CI : 0.6-2.3), respectively, before, and 1.5 (95% CI : 0.7-3.2) and 1.1 (95% CI : 0.6-2.3) after taking differences in study-design related factors into account. Accounting for these factors, the RH of death with AIDS was 0.9 (95% CI : 0.3-2.5) for central and 1.2 (95% CI : 0.4-3.4) for southern Europe compared with northern Europe. For the first CD4 count <200 cells/mu l these figures were 0.8 (95% CI : 0.5-1.4) and 0.8 (95% CI : 0.5-1.4). Age at seroconversion was the strongest predictor of disease progression. No statistically significant differences in disease progression were found by gender, foreign nationality, drug use and potential repeated HIV exposure.
   Conclusions We found no evidence for regional variability in HIV disease progression among European IDU. Future studies evaluating geographical differences should consider the confounding effect of study-design related factors and differential non-AIDS mortality. As age is an important determinant of disease progression, it should be considered in recommending treatment.

AB Although numerous reports have been published on the incidence of second cancers after adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, there have been few studies on the effect of the development of second cancer on overall survival (OS) of the patients. 1857 female patients younger than 80 years of age with operable breast cancer with UICC Stages I, II, and III who entered 3 trials of adjuvant therapy were studied for the detection of recurrence and second cancer. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 12 years (range, 5-25 years). 384 of recurrence and 119 of second cancers occurred. 465 deaths were recorded, the causes of which were designated to be due to recurrence of breast cancer in 326 patients, second cancers in 57, and due to other causes in 82. Many background factors that were significantly related to recurrence did not influence the incidence of and death by second cancers after mastectomy: age and menopausal status alone were related. The difference in the Kaplan-Meier curves between the event (recurrence and second cancers)free and relapse-free survivals indicates the incidence of second cancers is a significant event in post-operation course of early breast cancer patients (P=0.0001).
   The survival curve of patients who were free from recurrence- and second cancer-death is shown to be significantly lower than that of those free from breast cancer-specific death (P=0.0355), suggesting that death by second cancers is significantly influential to the overall survival. According to the Cox regression model using a recurrence or second cancers as time-dependent variables, the diagnosis of a recurrence or second cancer is shown to be highly significant to OS of the patients (hazard ratio: 49.3, and 6.3, respectively). Second cancers are shown to be not statistically significantly influential to the breast cancer specific survival (P=0.0637), nor a recurrence to second cancer specific survival (P=0.2285). In spite of heterogeneous distribution of sites of second primary cancers and their different natural histories, the incidence of second cancer has a significant effect on the postoperative survival of early breast cancer patients. In the survival analysis of early breast cancer patients, we have to estimate the contribution of second cancers to properly evaluate the effect of treatment.

TI Unleashing the power of planning to create disaster-resistant
   communities
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Human suffering and losses of lives and property in natural disasters can be reduced with appropriate planning for hazardous areas. Federal policies addressing these problems, however, have yet to recognize the importance of planning as the cornerstone of effective local hazard mitigation. In fact, federal programs make planning more difficult because they encourage the intensive use of hazardous land and shield local governments and private decision makers from financial losses in the disasters that inevitably follow. To unleash the power of planning for hazard mitigation, federal policies must be revised so that they help build local understanding ng of risk, commitment to hazard mitigation, and support for planning. A number of actions can be taken now to begin moving in this direction. In the long term, however, new legislation is needed to reduce subsidies that sustain and encourage development in hazardous areas and to increase assistance for planning.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Background. Information about the risk of smoking initiation among whites, African Americans, and Latino Americans has provided an important information base for smoking prevention programs among adolescents from these ethnic backgrounds. Unfortunately, there is a lack of such information for Asian Americans, a fast-growing ethnic minority group with much internal diversity.
   Method. This study used cross-sectional data from 20,482 subjects 12-17 years of age, randomly sampled in California, to describe and compare the risk of smoking initiation for adolescents by age among Asian American and other non-Asian ethnic groups, using survival analysis. Computer-aided telephone interview techniques were used in data collection.
   Result. The risk of early smoking initiation among Asian American adolescents is about a third of that of Caucasians. However, the risk among Asian Americans continues to increase throughout adolescence, while the same risk among Caucasians and African Americans plateaus around 14-15 years of age. Significant differences in the levels and patterns of smoking initiation among Asian American subgroups were observed, with Chinese Americans showing the lowest risk of smoking initiation and Filipino Americans the highest, Japanese and Korean Americans being in-between.
   Conclusion. Asian American adolescents may be especially at risk of smoking initiation later in adolescence, even though they are at lower risk early in adolescence. Smoking prevention programs for Asian Americans should continue throughout adolescence and early adulthood. (C) 1999 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

AB Natural and fabricated building materials commonly used in Egypt were surveyed for both natural radionuclides content and radon exhalation rate. These include raw as well as construction products. Concentration of natural radionuclides in all samples were determined by gamma-ray spectroscopy with HPGe detector. For Radon exhalation rate measurements of fabricated samples, the seal can-technique has been applied using CR-39 plastic track detectors. The radiation hazard indices of the total natural radioactivity in the studied samples were estimated. The results were compared with the corresponding results of different countries and were found to be lying within the average world values. Radon exhalation rate in the: studied samples varied between 197 (cement brick) and 907 mBq m(-2) h(-1) (blast furnace slag cement). The results of this survey suggest that, using blast furnace slag cement for pre-coating the internal walls of buildings in the Urban region of Egypt is discouraged and the replacement of clay brick by cement brick will be more healthy for the public.

AB Sociologists are growing increasingly skeptical toward research on risk conducted in other fields, and new perspectives on risk are emerging. Topics that merit further exploration include the social construction of risk and risk objects, risk analysis as a type of scientific enterprise, the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on risk, safety and risk as dynamic properties of social systems, and the social forces that create and allocate risk. In particular, sociologists need to place more emphasis on exploring the roles played by organizations and the state in hazard production and on formulating a political economy of risk. To a significantly greater degree than other disciplines concerned with risk, sociology emphasizes the contextual factors that structure vulnerability to hazards and the linkages that exist between vulnerability and social power.

TI Nonfasting plasma total homocysteine levels and all-cause and
   cardiovascular disease mortality in elderly Framingham men and women
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID CORONARY-ARTERY DISEASE; VASCULAR-DISEASE; NATURAL-HISTORY; RISK FACTOR;
   HYPERHOMOCYSTEINEMIA; HOMOCYSTINURIA
AB Background: Elevated fasting total homocysteine (tHcy) levels were recently shown to confer an independent risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among selected Norwegian patients with confirmed coronary heart disease. We examined whether elevated fasting plasma tHcy levels were predictive of all-cause and CVD mortality in a large, population-based sample of elderly US women and men.
   Methods: Nonfasting plasma tHcy levels were determined in 1933 elderly participants (mean age, 70 +/- 7 years; 58.9% women) from the original Framingham Study cohort, examined between 1979 and 1982, with follow-up through 1992. Unadjusted and adjusted (ie, for age, sex, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and creatinine) relative risk estimates (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for total and CVD mortality were generated by proportional hazards modeling, with tHcy levels (quartiles) as the independent variable.
   Results: There were 653 total deaths and 244 CVD deaths during a median follow-up of 10.0 years. Proportional hazards modeling revealed that tHcy levels of 14.26 mu mol/L or greater (the upper quartile), vs less than 14.26 mu mol/L (the lower three quartiles), were associated with relative risk estimates of 2.18 (95% CI, 1.86-2.56) and 2.17 (95% CI, 1.68-2.82) for all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively. The relative risk estimates after adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels attenuated these associations, but they remained significant: 1.54 (95% CI, 1.31-1.82) for all-cause mortality; 1.52 (95%;, CI, 1.16-1.98) for CVD mortality.
   Conclusion: Elevated nonfasting plasma tHcy levels are independently associated with increased rates of all-cause and CVD mortality in the elderly.

TI A fiber characterization of the natural zeolite, mordenite: A potential
   inhalation health hazard
SO AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ERIONITE; RATS
AB Interest in mordenite as an inhalation hazard arose when it was discovered that the mineral exists in the subsurface of Yucca Mountain, NV, the site of a federally proposed nuclear waste repository, During preliminary geologic investigations at Yucca Mountain, workers performing air coring (dry-drilling) operations were potentially exposed to aerosols of mordenite, Mordenite is also increasingly used in industrial applications, such as cation exchange, molecular absorbency, and reversible dehydration, Concern that the fibrous nature of mordenite may present an inhalation hazard is supported by the "Stanton Hypothesis," which states that the carcinogenicity of any fiber type depends upon dimension and durability rather than physicochemical properties. To date, little scientific literature is available on the inhalation health hazards of mordenite, This study initiates research in this area,
   Mordenite specimens collected from different geologic localities were analyzed macroscopically and microscopically. Mineral verification was performed using energy dispersive x-ray and x-ray diffraction analysis. Fibrous aerosols were generated to simulate aerosols created during air coring operations. Anderson cascade impacters were used to obtain aerosol mass median aerodynamic diameters, Electron microscopy of nucleopore filters allowed for individual aerosol fibers to be morphologically sized and applied to the Stanton Hypothesis for mesothelioma induction, Physical fiber dimensions were used to calculate aerodynamic diameters and to estimate pulmonary deposition. Results obtained from this study indicate that under similar conditions of aerosolization, using similar mordenite materials, inhalation of mordenite fibers could produce substantial deep-lung deposition.

AB Objective: Varicella-zoster (VZV) infection is an occupational hazard for health care workers. The "gold standard" for assessing protection is a positive antibody titer. We present a case of persistent serologic non-responsiveness following VZV immunization and discuss a management strategy.
   Methods: A 29-year-old woman, immunocompetent pediatric resident was repeatedly removed from her clinical duties because of a negative history of chicken pox and the absence of a VZV antibody titer, She received a total of three doses of the VZV vaccine and continued to have a negative antibody titer as measured by a commercial ELISA assay (Wampole). Subsequently, she had three direct contacts with infectious children and did not develop clinical chicken pox.
   Results: A lymphocyte proliferation assay was performed using inactivated varicella vaccine and tetanus antigens. The patient's varicella and tetanus stimulation index (SI) were 46.5 and 42, respectively. The SI for the positive control (a patient recently recovered from a wild type infection) were 144 (varicella specific), and 114 (tetanus), The SI secondary to VZV antigens reported in the literature is 30.5 +/- 9.1. We reassessed the varicella antibody titer using more sensitive assays: fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen and latex agglutination. Both tests verified the presence of VZV specific IgG at a titer of 1:8 in our patient.
   Conclusion: This case illustrates that in a subgroup of individuals the antibody response to VZV vaccine may be low despite an adequate cell-mediated response. Commercial VZV ELISA assays were designed to measure higher titers associated with natural infection rather than the lower titer induced by the vaccine. Repeated immunizations plus more sensitive measures of VZV-specific IgG should be used to validate protection rather than the current commonly utilized ELISA screening, Clinicians should be aware of the variability in VZV-specific antibody assays when assessing post VZV vaccine titers prior to determining protection in health care workers.

AB The opening up of the Alps for tourism has increased the risk potential from natural hazards, one of the greatest of which is debris flows. Since 1996 we have been studying the debris fan of Multetta above Tschierv in Val Mustair in the Swiss Alps to determine the dates and hence the frequency of debris flows. Abrupt growth changes, impact scars, and the formation of adventitious roots allowed precise dating by dendrochronological methods in cases where tree ring characteristics occurred synchronously in several different trees. Six debris hows since the late 15th century could be recognized, occurring at the end of the 15th century, and in 1573, 1655, 1784, 1958, and 1989, The debris deposited during the past 500 yr has formed a layer about 5 m deep. Two further debris flows were identified through scars formed in 1759 and 1837, A greater frequency of scars between the mid-18th century and the end of the 19th century indicates considerably higher morphological activity during the last peak of the Little Ice Age.

AB The number of natural catastrophes in this decade is four times greater than in the 1960s; economic losses are eight times greater; and insured losses are 15 times greater. The insurance industry's financial interest is inter-dependent with climate and weather. Natural events drive the demand for insurance coverage and can threaten the viability of an insurer if it is over-exposed in high risk areas. Early in the 1990s, the industry began to recognize that historical data were potentially misleading with respect to future natural catastrophe exposure. The U. S. insurance industry is pursuing a variety of new approaches including: the use of catastrophe computer models to integrate the natural knowledge about extreme events taken from the sciences into the actuarial sciences. The evaluation of building codes and building code enforcement in every community in the country enhanced its support for hazard mitigation.

AB Accurate records of basinwide Atlantic and U.S. landfalling hurricanes extend back to the mid 1940s and the turn of the century respectively, as a result of aircraft reconnaissance and instrumented weather stations along the U.S. coasts. Such long-term records are not exceeded elsewhere in the tropics. The Atlantic hurricanes, U.S. landfalling hurricanes and U.S. normalized damage time series are examined for interannual trends and multidecadal variability. It is found that only weak linear trends can be ascribed to the hurricane activity and that multidecadal variability is more characteristic of the region. Various environmental factors including Caribbean sea level pressures and 200mb zonal winds, the stratospheric Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, African West Sahel rainfall and Atlantic sea surface temperatures, are analyzed for interannual links to the Atlantic hurricane activity. All show significant, concurrent relationships to the frequency, intensity and duration of Atlantic hurricanes. Additionally, variations in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation are significantly linked to changes in U.S. tropical cyclone-caused damages. Finally much of the multidecadal hurricane activity can be linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Made - an empirical orthogonal function pattern derived from a global sea surface temperature record. Such linkages may allow for prediction of Atlantic hurricane activity on a multidecadal basis. These results are placed into the context of climate change and natural hazards policy.

AB 1, Patch-leaving decisions are of utmost importance in determining parasitoid foraging success. Parasitoids are known to use both marks left by hosts (chemical or otherwise) and ovipositions to assess host availability and to decide when to leave a host patch.
   2. Previous studies have shown that, depending on the species, ovipositions either increase (an incremental mechanism) or decrease (a decremental mechanism) the patch residence times of parasitoids. Reports in the literature conflict on which mechanism is used by Venturia canescens, a parasitoid of pyralid moth larvae.
   3, We hypothesize that, as a consequence of saturation in the capacity of the parasitoid to discriminate between host densities at high host numbers, V. canescens uses a decremental mechanism at low host numbers and an incremental one at high host numbers. We call this a 'switching mechanism'.
   4. Our experiments show that even if discrimination capacity saturates, V. canescens uses a decremental mechanism over a wide range of host densities.
   5. The distribution of hosts in different fruits species under field conditions suggests a switching mechanism would not evolve in natural situations.
   6. A model of patch departure in V. canescens is constructed and tested using an independent set of experiments. The model suggests that the patch leaving mechanism in V. canescens is a stochastic decremental one. As might be expected from Weber's Law, the initial leaving tendency is a convex decreasing function of kairomone concentration. The leaving tendency increases exponentially with the time spent in the patch without ovipositing. Ovipositions cause a sudden increase in leaving tendency.
   7. Simulations suggest that a decremental mechanism would be out-competed by either one indifferent to ovipositions or an incremental one, only when travel times are much larger than those that are likely to occur in the field.

AB Accident prevention relies on a proper understanding of relevant hazards so that appropriate controls can be put in place to safeguard those who are potentially endangered. Setting deaths from war, natural events and domestic accidents to one side, industrial chemicals in their manufacture, transport, storage and use arguably contribute significantly to society's accident toll. National and international regimes have been developed over the years to characterise the properties of these hazardous materials so that risks to society and workforces handling such 'dangerous goods' are reduced. Sometimes it has taken a disaster to show that a hazard formerly unrecognised did in fact exist; sometimes the closer scrutiny of test methods has shown that a dangerous property may have gone unrecognised; sometimes misuse of materials precipitated controls, However, in all the deliberations surrounding hazardous materials characterisation, accident investigation and prevention, and development of controls, suitable exchange of information and viewpoints between experts is necessary to promote development and adoption of international conventions. These international protocols are normally agreed by policy makers who have technical advisers to support their negotiations. These technical advisers need to meet in an appropriate forum to develop an understanding of all the relevant factors and to test ideas; often such group discussions pave the way to agreements being reached at formal policy negotiations, to solutions being provided for certain disasters, to better methods of testing. The International Group of Experts on the Explosion Risks of Unstable Substances (OECD-IGUS) created by the OECD is one such group. It first met in 1962.
   Set up initially to harmonise test methods used by countries to identify and quantify the explosive properties of unstable materials, it has continued over the years to offer scientists who are advisers to their governments (and others) a forum to exchange data and information primarily in support of the development of classifications regimes to protect society from the hazards of unstable substances and remove barriers to international trade but also in understanding and quantifying the resulting effects--such as explosion--from accidents involving these and other 'dangerous goods'. This paper describes some of the accidents which show the need for international controls for 'dangerous goods' and some of the contributions made by OECD-IGUS (often referred to as 'IGUS') to their developments.

ID GROUND MOTION
AB The floating type structural system is applicable to large offshore structures including airports, powerplants, and multi-purpose facilities. Such a large-scale floating structure should be in service at least 100 yr because of the large capital investments and social utilization, so it also should be designed to be safe and stable against several natural hazards and accidents during its service life. In this report, seismic response and risk analyses of a mega-floating structure supported with many dolphins (MFSD) are carried out to study the mutual interaction and its instability of the floating-dolphin system against earthquake attack. The final goal is to obtain the optimal allocation of dolphins to minimize the displacement of an MFSD.

ID WESTERN CAPE; AGRICHEMICAL SAFETY
AB Many farm workers in South Africa continue to live and work under adverse conditions that are the legacy of apartheid policies. Despite its official prohibition, the arrangement by which workers are given alcohol as a benefit of employment, known as the 'dop' system, appears to persist. Even though it is a minority of farms that currently actively practice the dop system, the ramifications of the historical institutionalisation of massive alcohol consumption are widespread. Heavy alcohol consumption is not only directly injurious to the health of farm workers and their families, but places them at risk to various social and environmental hazards. This is illustrated in a case of pesticide poisoning in which 24 workers were poisoned when given wine contaminated with the carbamate insecticide aldicarb. The case illustrates (i) the ongoing application of the dop system on farms in South Africa and (ii) the interaction between social factors and chemical exposures amongst farm workers. Public perceptions about the natural tendencies of 'coloured' people to drink heavily have much to do with perpetuating the dop system, and reinforcing a system geared towards the social control of rural farm workers and their families. The dop system poses a major challenge to the public health authorities in South Africa who are charged with the task of restructuring health services to address the human rights and health needs of marginal farming communities within a primary health care framework.

AB Motivated by applications in option pricing theory (Peskir, 1997b), (Research Report No. 386, Dept. Theoret. Statist. Aarhus, 19 pp.) we formulate and solve the following problem. Given a standard Brownian motion B = (B-t)(t greater than or equal to 0) and a centered probability measure mu on R having the distribution function F with a strictly positive density F' satisfying
   integral(0)(infinity) x log x mu(dx) < infinity,
   there exists a cost function x bar arrow pointing right c(x) in the optimal stopping problem
   [GRAPHICS]
   such that for the optimal stopping time tau(*) we have
   B-tau* similar to mu.
   The cost function is explicitly given by the formula:
   c(x) = 1/2 F'(x)/(1-F(x)),
   where one incidentally recognizes x bar arrow pointing right F'(x)/(1-F(x)) as the Hazard function of mu. There is also a simple explicit formula for the optimal stopping time tau(*), but the main emphasis of the result is on the existence of the underlying functional in the optimal stopping problem. The integrability condition on mu is natural and cannot be improved. The condition on the existence of a strictly positive density is imposed for simplicity, and more general cases could be treated similarly. The method of proof combines ideas and facts on optimal stopping of the maximum process (Peskir, 1997a), (Research Report No. 377, Dept. Theoret. Statist. Aarhas, 30 pp.) and the Azema-Yor solution of the Skorokhod-embedding problem (Azema and Yor, 1979a, b), (Sem. Probab. XIII, Lecture Notes in Math., vol. 721, Springer, Berlin, pp. 90-115; 625-633). A natural connection between these two theories is established, and new facts of interest for both are displayed. The result extends in a similar form to stochastic integrals with respect to B, as well as to more general diffusions driven by B. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Purpose-Elevated concentrations of the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) predict ischemic cardiac events in both hospital- and population-based studies and may signify a role for inflammation in the destabilization of cardiovascular disease. We examined the relationship between CRP and outcome after acute ischemic stroke.
   Methods-This was a subgroup analysis from a prospective observational study based in a University Hospital Acute Stroke Unit serving a population of approximate to 260 000, Survival time and cause of death for up to 4 years after the index stroke were determined and related to CRP concentration within 72 hours of stroke and known prognostic variables by a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
   Results-Ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 228 of 283 consecutive admissions. Median follow-up was 959 days, Geometric mean CRP concentration was 10.1 mg/L. Survival in those with CRP >10.1 mg/L was significantly worse than in those with CRP less than or equal to 10.1 mg/L (P=0.00009, log-rank test). Higher CRP concentration was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio, 1.23 per additional natural log unit; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.35; P=0.02), together with age and stroke severity on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 76% of deaths in those with CRP >10.1 mg/L and 63% of deaths in those with CRP less than or equal to 10.1 mg/L.
   Conclusions-CRP concentration is an independent predictor of survival after ischemic stroke. These findings are consistent with a role for inflammation in acute ischemic stroke, as well as with the hypothesis that elevated CRP may predict future cardiovascular mortality.

AB Background-Previous natural history studies in broad populations of heart failure patients have associated female gender with improved survival, particularly in patients with a nonischemic etiology of ventricular dysfunction. This study investigates whether a similar survival advantage for women would be evident among patients with advanced heart failure.
   Methods and Results-The study analysis is based on the Flolan international Randomized Survival Trial (FIRST) study which enrolled 471 patients (359 men and 112 women) who had evidence of end-stage heart failure with marked symptoms (60% NYHA class IV) and severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction 18+/-4.9%). A Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted for age, gender, 6-minute walk, dobutamine use at randomization, mean pulmonary artery blood pressure, and treatment assignment, showed a significant association between female gender and better survival (relative risk of death for men versus women was 2.18, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.41; P<0.001). Although formal interaction testing was negative (P=0.275), among patients with a nonischemic etiology of heart failure, the relative risk of death for men versus women was 3.08 (95% CI 1.56 to 6.09, P=0.001), whereas among those with ischemic heart disease, the relative risk: of death for men versus women was 1.64 (95% CI 0.87 to 3.09, P=0.127).
   Conclusions-Women with advanced heart failure appear to have better survival than men. Subgroup analysis suggests this finding is strongest among patients with a nonischemic etiology of heart failure.

AB Background-The outcome of aortic regurgitation conservatively followed in clinical practice is poorly defined.
   Methods and Results-Long-term outcome of 246 patients with severe or moderately severe aortic regurgitation diagnosed by color Doppler echocardiography was analyzed. With conservative management, mortality rate was higher than expected (at 10 years, 34+/-5%, P<0.001) and morbidity was high (10-year rates of 47+/-6% for heart failure and 62+/-4% for aortic valve surgery). At 10 years, 75+/-3% of patients had died or had surgery and 83+/-3% had had cardiovascular events. In multivariate analysis, predictors of survival were age (P<0.001), functional class (P<0.001), comorbidity index (P=0.033), atrial fibrillation (P=0.002), and left ventricular end-systolic diameter corrected for body surface area (P=0.025). Ejection fraction was also an independent predictor of overall survival, including postoperative follow-up of surgically treated patients (P<0.001). High risk during conservative treatment, with mortality rate in excess of that expected, was noted among patients with severe, even transient, symptoms (24.6% yearly, P<0.001) but also in those with mild (class IT) symptoms (6.3% yearly,P=0.02) and in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <55% (5.8% yearly, P=0.03) or with end-systolic diameter normalized to body surface area greater than or equal to 25 mm/m(2) (7.8% yearly, P=0.004). Surgery performed during follow-up was independently associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.54; P=0.048).
   Conclusions-Patients diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation in clinical practice incur excess mortality and high morbidity, underscoring the serious prognosis of the disease. Surgery, which reduces cardiac mortality rates, should be considered promptly in high-risk patients.

AB Data from a British national cohort of women born in 1946 were used to investigate the hypothesis that the rate of depletion of oocyte numbers is associated with the age at which a woman reaches the inception of the perimenopause. Menopausal status was obtained using an annual questionnaire, sent to the cohort since the age of 47 years, and risk factor information from contacts with the survey throughout earlier life. Parous women entered the perimenopause later than nulliparous women. Those with the most children had the latest perimenopause, where the estimated hazard ratio for women having four or more children compared with those having none was 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.81). Women who had a unilateral oophorectomy reached perimenopause earlier then those who had not (hazard ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.15-3.35), There was some evidence that early age at menarche and short menstrual cycles were associated with an earlier perimenopause. No relation was observed with oral contraceptive pill use. Results provided some support for the hypothesis under consideration, while estimates of the median age at inception of the perimenopause due to these factors ranged from 46 to 50 years, which is an important variation with respect to later health.

TI When earthquake damage is seen as preventable: Attributions, locus of
   control and attitudes to risk
SO APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE

DT Article
ID HAZARDOUS PROCESSES; MENTAL MODELS; PERCEPTION
AB Previous studies have demonstrated that locus of control and risk attitudes influence preparation for natural hazards. Two studies examined which of these two factors is the stronger predictor of earthquake judgements and preparation. These concepts were linked to attribution models of earthquake damage, by examining the effect of the distinctiveness of damage on attributions, and explanatory complexity. In both studies, the first with students and the second with non-student members of the public, low risk-takers were more likely to have made more preparations for earthquakes, and distinctive damage was judged more preventable than global damage. With students, low risk-taking also predicted judgements that an earthquake was probable. Students with a more internal locus of control were more likely to judge that distinctive earthquake damage was preventable, whereas nonstudents with a more internal locus of control were more likely to give complex explanations of earthquake damage. These findings have several implications for enhancing preparedness for earthquakes and other hazards.

SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE beaches; coastal management programs; dunes; program evaluation
AB This article reports on state coastal zone management (CZM) effectiveness in meeting the national goal of protecting natural shoreline resources. The research focuses on efforts to protect beaches, dunes, bluffs, and rocky shores. This study concludes that stale CZM programs are effective overall in addressing the protection objective of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). This conclusion recognizes that the CZMA requires states to balance competing needs and demands such as protection of natural resources from hazards and overdevelopment, promotion of recreational use, and respect for private property rights. Determination of CZM program effectiveness is based on process indicators and case examples. Outcome indicators were too sparse to allow an outcome effectiveness determination. All coastal states and territories use a wide variety of tools and processes to achieve resource protection, including regulatory, planning, state land management, acquisition, nonregulatory, and research tools. Regulatory tools are the most significant tools employed nationwide, because the majority of the oceanfront shoreline is in private ownership and is subject to significant shoreline change and development pressures. Over 60 significant upgrades to coastal management programs have been implemented over the years to protect natural shoreline resources. "Process indicators" of effectiveness show increased resource protection from CZM efforts. Of the 29 coastal states and territories studied, most (23) employ setbacks from the shoreline to provide a natural buffer between development and the water. All (27) but a few regulate shoreline activities to protect critical habitat and minimize adverse impacts on resources. All (28) but one regulate shoreline stabilizations to minimize adverse impacts on beach systems. Most (23) restrict pedestrian and vehicular access to channel human encroachment along boardwalks or dune crossovers, minimizing dune destabilization and impacts on fragile resources. All (28) but one use planning tools to designate and protect specific shoreline resources. Within state coastal parks, most (25) have designated natural protection areas and guided accessways. Many (21) have acquired additional coastal land holdings. Almost half use boardwalks or dune crossovers to protect dune vegetation and minimize adverse impacts on natural resources, and sand fencing and dune creation to restore the natural function of damaged dune systems. Over half (17) use beach nourishment to recreate eroding recreational beaches. Greater attention is needed to document on-the-ground results of CZM resource protection efforts through in-depth case studies and long-term monitoring of resource indicators of program success.

AB The effect of plasma glucose concentration on overall and cause-specific mortality was examined in 1,745 Pima Indians (725 men, 1,020 women) greater than or equal to 15 years old with type 2 diabetes. During a median follow-up of 10.6 years (range 0.1-24.8), 533 subjects (275 men, 258 women) died; 113 of the deaths were attributable to cardiovascular disease, 96 to diabetes-related diseases (diabetic nephropathy for 92 of these), 249 to other natural causes, and 75 to external causes. After adjusting for age, sex, duration of diabetes, and BMI in a generalized additive proportional hazards model, higher baseline 2-h postload plasma glucose concentration predicted deaths from cardiovascular disease (P = 0.007) and diabetes-related diseases (P = 0.003), but not from other natural causes (P = 0.73), An increment of 5.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl) in the 2-h plasma glucose concentration was associated with 1.2 times (95% CI 1.1-1.4) the death rate from cardiovascular disease, 1.3 times (95% CI 1.1-1.5) the death rate from diabetes-related diseases, and almost no change in the death rate from other natural causes (rate ratio = 1.0; 95% CI 0.94-1.1), In Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, higher plasma glucose concentration predicts deaths from cardiovascular and diabetes-related diseases but has little or no effect on deaths from other natural or external causes.

AB The natural history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) differs markedly between patients with diet treated and pharmacologically treated disease. However, the interrelationship between hypertension and these common diabetes types has not been specifically addressed in previous studies. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic significance and prevalence of hypertension in coronary patients with diet versus pharmacologically treated NIDDM over a 5-year follow-up period. The study sample comprised 11 515 patients aged 45 to 74 years with a previous myocardial infarction and/or anginal syndrome who had been screened but were not included in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention study. Among them, 9033 were nondiabetics and 2482, diabetics (987 diet treated and 1495 pharmacologically treated). The prevalence of hypertension among nondiabetics, diet-treated diabetics, and pharmacologically treated diabetics was 31%, 42%, and 43%, respectively. Crude all-cause mortality (CM) was lower in the nondiabetic patients (11.2% versus 22.0%; P < 0.001). Among diabetics, 548 patients died: 81 diet treated normotensives (CM 14%); 100 diet-treated hypertensives (CM 24.4%); 205 pharmacologically treated normotensives (CM 24.2%); and 162 pharmacologically treated hypertensive patients (CM 25.0%). Age-adjusted mortality was lowest for the normotensive patients in the diet-treated group and highest for the hypertensive pharmacologically treated patients, Multivariate analysis shows that hypertension is a strong and independent predictor of increased CM in diet-treated but not in pharmacologically treated NIDDM: hazard ratio (HR) was 1.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 2.29) for the diet-treated versus 1.01 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.26) for the pharmacologically treated diabetics, The contribution of hypertension to stroke mortality was substantial for both diet treated and pharmacologically treated NIDDM: hazard ratios were 3.17 (95% CI 1.12 to 8.98) and 2.21 (95% CI 0.72 to 6.77), respectively. The increased risk of mortality associated with hypertension in relatively mild diet-treated NIDDM strongly supports the clinical benefit of early blood pressure control among diabetic patients with ischemic heart disease.

TI How useful is landslide hazard information? Lessons learned in the San
   Francisco Bay Region
SO INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Landslides. worldwide and in the United States. are arguably the most costly natural hazard. Substantial landslide information is available, but much of it remains underutilized, as a disconnect exists among geologists, decision makers, and the public. The lack of a national landslide insurance policy exacerbates this situation and promotes litigation as the principal recourse for recouping landslide-damage losses. The U.S. Geological Survey's landslide investigation in the San Francisco Bay region of California provides a context for making suggestions on how Ear-th science information could be used more effectively.

TI Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma: The puzzles of long latency
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma; latency; pattern of failure
ID RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS; RADIOTHERAPY; SURVIVAL
AB Purpose: To study the peculiar characteristics of relapses with long latency following radical treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
   Methods and Materials: 847 patients with nasopharyngeal recurrence were retrospectively studied, focusing on the independent effects of latency on different outcome aspects and its relationship with other prognostic factors.
   Results: The proportion of recurrence with latency <2 years (Group A), 2-<5 years (Group B), and greater than or equal to 5 years (Group C) were 52%, 39%, and 9%, respectively. A higher proportion of Group C originated from patients with node-negative early primary, but fewer of them were still confined within the nasopharynx at detection of recurrence. There was no significant difference in the choice of salvage modality, but among those reirradiated, more of Group C were treated with external beams to a higher dose. The difference in local salvage rate was not statistically significant, but the 5-year distant failure-free rates of the 3 groups were 57%, 67%, and 83%, respectively; and the corresponding disease-specific survival (DSS) were 14%, 20%, and 35%. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent significance of latency in predicting distant failure (hazard ratio = 0.81 per year, p < 0.01) and cancer deaths (hazard ratio = 0.90 per year, p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Nasopharyngeal recurrence with long latency showed different natural behavior: the prognosis was significantly better due to lower risk of distant failure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

   samples using delvotest microbial inhibitor tests

ID ASSAYS
AB The use of antibiotic therapy to treat and prevent udder infections of cows during the dry period is a key component of mastitis control in many countries.' At the same time, the general public is becoming increasingly aware of potential hazards from antibiotic residues in foods. Consequently, Delvotest Cow Test (Royal Gist-brocades NV, Delft, The Netherlands), an on-farm version of Delvotest P, a microbial inhibitor test for antimicrobials, is being increasingly used by farmers to assess that milk from individual cows is fit for consignment to the bulk tank. Occasional reports of unexplained positive test results have led to suggestions of possible false-positive reactions in milk from individual cows. To investigate the potential causes of such positive test results, three separate investigations were undertaken. In a field survey of unexplained positive reports from farmers, 14 milk samples from six farms that tested positive were all found to contain antibiotic residues. In more formal investigations of individual quarter milk samples from an experimental herd, none of 134 milk samples from midlactation cows yielded positive reactions; for cows that had just calved, 16 of 144 milk samples were positive, and, of those, 13 had somatic cell counts >4,000,000/ml. Natural inhibitors were responsible for 1 positive reaction, 8 positive reactions were related to incomplete milking, and 7 samples contained beta-lactam antibiotics. Positive reactions caused by antibiotic persisted in individual quarter samples for up to 7 d postcalving compared with 4 d for milk samples from the whole udder. Delvotest was sensitive to cephalonium, the active ingredient of Cepravin Dry Cow (Mallinckrodt Veterinary Ltd., Uxbridge, United Kingdom), which is the market-leading product in the United Kingdom. Test results yielded a partial purple color reaction in the presence of 8 mu g/kg of cephalonium and a completely purple reaction at 16 mu g/kg. These results confirm the validity of Delvotest when used to examine composite milk samples from individual cows supplying the United Kingdom dairy industry and suggest that, with proper attention to milk withdrawal periods and complete milking, there is no obvious risk of antibiotic contamination of milk.

AB Few studies have examined the effect of interactions between predation and hunting on the rate of game bird mortality throughout the year. We monitored 134 radiotagged willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus lagopus) on 3 contiguous areas, 2 nonhunted and 1 hunted, in central Sweden between 1992 and 1995. We recorded 100 known mortalities: 22 from hunting, 40 from raptors, 19 from mammalian predators, and 19 from other causes. Excluding hunting, cause of death was similar on hunted and nonhunted areas (P > 0.5), with raptors the most important cause of death in all seasons. We did not record any deaths due to mammalian predators in winter or spring, and deaths through collision with power lines only affected winter, but not annual, survival rates. Cox proportional hazard modeling revealed season (autumn, winter-spring, summer) and area (hunted, nonhunted) as the only variables to affect risk of death (P < 0.001). The greatest rates of hunting mortality (0.24) and natural predation (0.32) occurred on the hunted area during autumn. Autumn survival on the hunted area (0.49) was lower (P = 0.029) that on the nonhunted areas (0.71). Survival increased in winter-spring to 0.69 on the hunted area and 0.81 on the nonhunted areas, and remained high (>0.78) through the summer period. We believe hunting mortality was mostly, if not totally, additive to natural mortality in our study. The population density on the hunted area did not decline as expected from the results, and we suggest that immigration from beyond the neighboring nonhunted areas was sustaining the population. We conclude that a harvest model for willow grouse must take account for dispersal and predation rates at a landscape scale.

ID WALKER
AB Different accident patterns were noted for children using walkers and not using walkers at the time of an accident. The children were divided into two locomotion groups, natural locomotion (384 children) and walker-aided locomotion (235 children), depending on the presence or absence of a walker during the fall down the stairs. A review of incidents reported by a sample of emergency rooms identified 619 falls down steps by children between 5 and 18 mo. old during the first 6 months of 1995. The age of the highest risk, as indicated by the frequency of falls down the stairs, for the walker-aided locomotion group was 8 mo. The age of highest risk for the natural locomotion group was 12 mo. Children who fall down the stairs, in or out of a walker, are victims of the same hazard, unprotected stairs. Home safety recommendations to reduce che risk of young children falling down the stairs are provided.

AB The main objective of the present study was to investigate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in Mai Po Marshes Natural Reserve, Hong Kong. During June-December 1997, samples of sediments and aquatic organisms including fish (Oreochromis mossambica x O. nilotica; Mugil cephalus) and shrimps (Metapenaeus ensis, Macrobrachium nipponense), were collected from get il ais and total PCB levels were measured. The concentrations of PCBs in sediments reduced gradually from coastal sites (8.13 ng g(-1) dry wt) to landward sites (1.47 ng g(-1) dry wt), which suggested that PCBs in Deep Bay waters were the main input source entering the reserve. The calculated PCB concentrations in water were generally safe for aquaculture according to the U.S. EPA guidelines, but PCBs in muscle tissues of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) exceeded the guidelines. PCB concentrations (ng g(-1) lipid) in tilapia increased with increases in fish body size, which was possibly due to active uptake of PCBs by tilapia. Within the same shrimp species, different sized organisms showed similar PCB contents in lipid, indicating that lipid content rather than body size determined body concentrations. The PCB concentrations in the aquatic organisms in the reserve posed no hazards to birds according to predicted egg toxicity effects.

AB There is a continual influx of heavy metal contaminants and pollutants into the biosphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources. A complex variety of abiotic and biotic processes affects their speciation and distribution, including adsorption onto and desorption from mineral surfaces, incorporation in precipitates or coprecipitates, release through the dissolution of minerals, and interactions with plants and microbes. Some of these processes can effectively isolate heavy metals from the biosphere, whereas others cause their release or transformation to different species that may be more (or less) bioavailable and/or toxic to organisms. Here we focus on abiotic adsorption and precipitation or coprecipitation processes involving the common heavy metal contaminant lead and the metalloids arsenic and selenium in mine tailings and contaminated soils. We have used extremely intense x-rays from synchrotron sources and a structure-sensitive method known as x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy to determine the molecular-level speciation of these elements at concentrations of 50 to several thousand ppm in the contaminated environmental samples as well as in synthetic sorption samples. Our XAFS studies of As and ph in the mine tailings show that up to 50% of these contaminants in the samples studied may be present as adsorbed species on mineral surfaces, which makes them potentially more bioavailable than when present in sparingly soluble solid phases. Our XAFS studies of Se(VI) sorption on Fe2+-containing sulfates show that this element undergoes redox reactions that transform it into less bioavailable and less toxic species, This type of information on molecular-level speciation of heavy metal and metalloid contaminants in various environmental settings is needed to prioritize remediation efforts and to assess their potential hazard to humans and other organisms.

AB BACKGROUND. The biologic behavior of T1a prostate adenocarcinoma is variable. A critical issue in the management of patients with Tla prostate adenocarcinoma is to distinguish those who will develop cancer progression from those who will not. Predictive factors that identify those at high risk of cancer progression are needed to stratify patients for treatment. In the current study the authors attempted to identify such predictors of cancer progression in a large series of untreated patients with lengthy follow-up.
   METHODS. The authors studied 102 patients who were diagnosed with Tla prostate adenocarcinoma (incidental tumor involving less than or equal to 5% of the resected prostatic tissue) at the time they underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) at the Mayo Clinic between 1960-1970. None of these patients were treated. Patient ages ranged from 48-91 years (mean I standard deviation, 69 +/- 7 years). The average weight of the resected prostate tissue was 24 +/- 18 g (range, 3-115 g; median, 18 g). Tumor volume was measured by the grid method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with cancer progression. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   RESULTS. Five-year and 10-year progression free survival rates were 93% and 87%, respectively. During the mean follow-up of 9.5 +/- 6.8 years (range, 0.3-31 years; median, 9.0 years), 14 patients developed clinical cancer progression, including 5 patients with systemic progression (1 with distant metastases and 4 who died of prostate adenocarcinoma). The interval from diagnosis to clinical cancer progression ranged from 1-23 years (mean, 7.3 years). The amount of resected prostate tissue (TURP weight) was associated with progression (P = 0.04). Patients with a TURP weight greater than or equal to 30 g had 100% progression free survival at 10 years compared with a progression free survival rate of 73% in patients with a TURF weight < 12 g. Gleason score, tumor volume, number of chips involved by tumor, number of tumor foci, and the presence of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia were not significant in predicting cancer progression. There was a trend toward a worse prognosis with the increasing number of chips involved by cancer (P = 0.16). Patients with < 3 chips involved by cancer had a 88% 10-year progression free survival rate compared with 73% in patients with greater than or equal to 3 chips involved by cancer.
   CONCLUSIONS. The clinical course of Tla prostate adenocarcinoma is variable. If left untreated, a small but significant proportion of patients are at risk for disease progression and death. However, the current study found that patients with a TURF weight greater than or equal to 30 g have an excellent prognosis and can be managed conservatively. Cancer 1999;85:1300-4.

AB BACKGROUND. To the authors' knowledge previous reports of patient outcome for advanced stage low grade follicular lymphomas (LGFL) have not been population-based. This is the first report describing the outcome of these patients based on a population-based cohort.
   METHODS. A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients diagnosed with advanced stage LGFL between 1987-1995 for the adult population of central and northern Alberta, Canada.
   RESULTS. One hundred and fifty-seven patients were diagnosed with advanced stage LGFL. Approximately 45% of patients had died at last follow-up. Treatment was initiated at the time of diagnosis in 87 patients (55%), with alkylating agents used in 66% of them. Of the 70 patients not treated at the initial diagnosis, 69% had been treated at a median of 16.3 months. The overall median survival was 5.9 years. On univariate analysis, significant variables (P < 0.20) included age, B symptoms, symptomatic lymphadenopathy, symptomatic splenomegaly, splenomegaly, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), diffuse component on histology, and treatment at the time of diagnosis. By multivariate analysis, the only factors that influenced survival significantly and independently were baseline LDH and B symptoms. An elevated baseline LDH had a hazard ratio of 2.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65, 4.74) and a median survival of 8.0 years versus 3.6 years (P < 0.0001). B symptoms had a hazard ratio of 2.30 (95% CI, 1.23, 4.30) and a median survival of 6.5 years versus 3.1 years (P < 0.0067).
   CONCLUSIONS. Although some patients with advanced stage LGFL enjoy a prolonged survival, 80% of deaths in this cohort were attributable to lymphoma. The median overall survival of 5.9 years offers a less positive perspective on the outcome of these patients than in previous nonpopulation-based reports. This emphasizes the need for further population-based studies as well as new therapeutic approaches, especially those directed toward patients with poor prognostic features such as elevated baseline LDH and B symptoms.

AB Objectives: To investigate the correlation between the serum levels of the CC-chemokines RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta, and the progression of HIV-1 disease.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of serial serum samples from HIV-1 seroconverters selected according to clinical outcome.
   Methods: Twenty-one patients, derived from a cohort recruited between 1985 and 1996 for a prospective study of the natural history of HIV infection, were analysed. All patients had at least one HIV-1-seronegative sample within 1 year prior to the first seropositive test acid were followed longitudinally throughout the course of HIV-1 infection (mean follow-up, 73.5 months). Nine were rapid progressors (RP; patients who developed AIDS within 60 months of antibody seroconversion), seven were slow progressors (SP; patients who developed AIDS after GO months), and five were long-term asymptomatic (LTA; patients with circulating CD4+ cells higher than 400 x 10(6)/l, no signs of HIV disease, no antiretroviral therapy for more than 96 months). A total of 339 serum samples was studied (mean, 16.1 per patient). The levels of RANTES, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and correlated with different immunological and clinical parameters.
   Results: Over the entire follow-up period, the geometric mean of serum RANTES was significantly higher in RP [68.6 ng/ml; 95% confidence interval (CI), 56.9-82.7] than in SP (23.7 ng/ml; 95% CI, 20.0-28.2; P < 0.001) and LTA (19.5 ng/ml; 95% CI, 15.5-24.5; P < 0.001). This difference was already significant during the early clinical stages, when patients had peripheral blood CD4+ cell counts still greater than 400 x 10(6)/l (P < 0.001). By contrast, the mean serum levels of MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta did not differ significantly between the three study groups. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that the mean serum concentration of RANTES before the development of AIDS was independently associated with the time to AIDS (relative risk, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.1-18.2; P = 0.035). in patients with low versus high mean serum RANTES before the fall of CD4+ cells below 400 x 10(6)/l, the median AIDS-free time was 117.5 and 42.7 months, respectively (P = 0.037).
   Conclusion: These data suggest that an elevation of serum RANTES predicts a rapid progression of the disease since the early stages of HIV-1 infection. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
