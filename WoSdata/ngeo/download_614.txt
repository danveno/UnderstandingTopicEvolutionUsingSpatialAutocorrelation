AB Objective: To investigate disease progression and risk factors in a large geographically based population with multiple sclerosis (MS), using two different inception points-clinical onset and date of birth. Methods: The authors reviewed a database of subjects with definite MS and symptom onset prior to July 1988. The main outcome was sustained progression to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 6 (requires a cane), using the date of birth and date of MS onset as inception points in separate analyses. Risk factors examined were sex, relapsing vs primary progressive course, onset age, and onset symptoms. Results: The study included 2,837 patients, followed prospectively for 22,723 patient years. The median time to EDSS 6 was 27.9 years, 15 years after onset; only 21% reached EDSS 6, and by age 50, 28% required a cane. Men progressed 38% more quickly than women from onset (p < 0.0005), yet both required canes at similar ages: 58.8 years for men and 60.1 for women (p = 0.082). A younger onset age predicted a slower progression, but those older at onset were consistently older when reaching EDSS 6. A primary progressive course predicted a more rapid progression from both onset (p < 0.0005) and birth (hazard ratio = 2.7 [95% CI: 2.2 to 3.3]). No onset symptom consistently predicted progression. Conclusion: Disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) accrued more slowly than found in earlier longitudinal studies. The authors also challenged two fundamental concepts in MS, demonstrating that neither male sex nor older onset age was associated with worse disease outcome.

AB Using Geographic Information Systems and US Forest Service data, we examined relationships between prescribed burning (from 1979 to 2000) and the incidence, size, and intensity of wildfires (from 1995 to 2000) in a landscape containing formerly fire-suppressed, closed-canopy hardwood and pine-hardwood forests. Results of hazard (failure) analyses did not show an increased likelihood of large, small, or intense wildfires with an increase in the number of years since the last prescribed fire. Wildfires of various sizes and intensities were more likely to occur in years with lower than average precipitation, regardless of when these areas were last burned. Calculations of expected lightning-fire potential based on weather patterns predicted a peak in lightning-started fires in the early to late summer. Lightning fires were rare, however, and wildfire activity was greatest in the spring and fall. We hypothesize that the ineffectiveness of prescribed burning in reducing wildfire hazard and the low incidence of wildfires in the midsummer in north Mississippi are both artifacts of fire suppression in the past, which converted open oak-pine woodlands with persistent pyrogenic surface fuels that accumulated over time to closed-canopy forests that lack such fuels. We suggest that open canopies and grass-based surface fuels must first be restored before prescribed burning will achieve most desirable management goals in this region, including hazard reduction and ecological restoration of natural fire regimes.

SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES

DT Article
ID LANDSLIDE; GIS; SPAIN; PREDICTION; SYSTEM
AB Liechtenstein has faced an increasing number of natural hazards over recent decades: debris flows, slides, snow avalanches and floods repeatedly endanger the local infrastructure. Geomorphological field mapping and geoelectrical profiling was used to assess hazards near Malbun, a village potentially endangered by landslides, and especially debris flows. The area is located on the tectonic contacts of four different nappe slices. The bedrock consists of anhydrite and gypsum, dolomite, shale, marl, and limestone. The spatial distribution and occurrence of debris flows and slides is evaluated through a combination of geomorphological expert knowledge, and detailed visualization in a geographical information system. In a geo-database a symbol-based 1:3000 scale geomorphological map has been digitized and rectified into polygons. The polygons include information on the main geomorphological environment, the Quaternary material distribution and of geomorphological processes, which are stored in attribute tables. The spatial distribution of these attributes is then combined with geophysical information and displacement rates interpolated from benchmark measurements. On one of the landslides two geo-electrical profiles show that the distance to a potential failure plane varies between 10-20 m and that the topography of the failure plane is influenced by subterranean gypsum karst features. The displacement measurements show that this landslide actively disintegrates into minor slides and is not, therefore, a risk to the village of Malbun. The hazard zonation indicates that debris flows can pose a risk if no countermeasures are taken. Gypsum karst may locally accelerate the landslide activity. In contrast, the impact of debris flows is diminished because collapse dolines may act as sediment traps for the debris flow materials. This research illustrates how geomorphological expert knowledge can be integrated in a GIS for the evaluation of natural hazards on a detailed scale.

AB Among the various natural hazards, mass movements (MM) are probably the most damaging to the natural and human environment in Mediterranean!, countries, including Lebanon which represents a good case study. This research deals with how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for establishing the relationships between MM occurrence and different factor terrain parameters over a representative region of Lebanon. Parameters expressed by: 1-ancillary data like lithology, proximity to fault zone, soil type, land cover/use, distance to drainage line and rainfall quantity, and 2-derived data like slope gradient and slope aspect, were correlated with MM using GIS-approaches. The MM were first detected through visual interpretation of two stereo-pairs of SPOT 4 images (anaglyph) at 10 in resolution. This study indicates, depending on bivariate Remote Sensing and GIS statistical correlations (Kendall Tau-b correlation), that the lithology is the most influencing factor on MM occurrence. It also shows that statistical correlations to mass movements exist best between factors at the following decreasing order of importance: lithology-proximity to fault line, lithology-soil type and lithology - distance to drainage line at 1% level of significance, and soil-land cover/use, slope aspect-land cover/use, and soil-slope gradient at 5% level of significance. These correlations were verified and checked through field observations and explained using univariate statistical correlations. Therefore, they could be extrapolated to other Mediterranean countries having similar geoenvironmental conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of local geology on ground motion in the City of Palermo, Italy,

AB On 6 September 2002 a M-w 5.9 earthquake occurred in the southern Tyrrhenian sea, 40 kin off the coast of Palermo (Italy). In the days after the mainshock, eight temporary stations were installed in the city to record aftershocks on different geological formations. Seismograms of about 30 earthquakes with magnitude >= 2.8 are analyzed. The data analysis confirms the role of near-surface geology in causing locally significant variations of the ground-shaking level as already inferred by Guidoboni et al. (2003) from historical damage scenario studies. The largest spectral variations estimated through aftershock recordings result in a factor of 10 difference between stiff and soft sites, in frequency bands varying from 1 to 3.5 Hz. The geological structure of the study area is reconstructed by using data from more than 2000 boreholes organized in a Geographic Information System specifically dedicated to the assessment of natural hazards in urban areas. Vertically varying velocity models are used for a comparison with the observed data. In general, ID transfer functions fit the largest amplification frequency but underestimate amplitudes of observations probably because of 2D and 3D complexity. Because the seismic stations were not installed in free field but at ground or underground level inside buildings, a possible influence of the structure was also investigated. Simultaneous ambient noise measurements were performed on the top, at the base, and outside the buildings where stations were installed. For all but one site, this analysis shows that the estimated ground-motion amplifications do not reflect the building vibration modes and therefore, in these cases, soil-structure interaction does not bias the free-field response of the study sites. Finally, speculations on the effect of the local geology in terms of response spectra of the M-w 5.9 mainshock are discussed in the framework of the Eurocode 8 prescriptions.

AB Ecological regression studies are widely used in geographical epidemiology to assess the relationships between health hazard and putative risk factors. Very often, health data are measured at an aggregate level because of confidentiality restrictions, while putative risk factors are measured on a different grid, i.e., independent (exposure) variable and response (counts) variable are spatially misaligned. To perform a regression of risk on exposure, one needs to realign the spatial support of the variables. Bayesian hierarchical models constitute a natural approach to the problem because of their ability to model the exposure field and the relationship between exposure and relative risk at different levels of the hierarchy, taking proper account of the variability induced by the covariate estimation. In the current paper, we propose two fully Bayesian solutions to the problem. The first one is based on the kernel-smoothing technique, while the second one is built on the tessellation of the study region. We illustrate our methods by assessing the relationship between exposure to uranium in drinkable waters and cancer incidence, in South Carolina (USA).

AB The role of geoenvironmental information is becoming increasingly important as legislative changes have forced developers and planning authorities to consider more implications and impact on the environment of large-scale development initiatives. Therefore, integration of surface and subsurface geoscientific information for development needs has prime importance and provides a means of identifying potential problems and opportunities at an early stage in any planned development. However, from the experience of recent natural disasters, it is evident that this was not the case taken into consideration in many countries. In addition to thousands of casualties, many urbanized areas, industrial districts and large-scale engineering structures suffered severe damages from the natural hazards due to many reasons including the lack of preliminary engineering geological maps and zoning maps of the settlement areas. Turkey is one of the countries which is exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides and floods. In particular, the devastating 1999 Kocaeli earthquake, which affected the Marmara Region of Turkey, focused the attention on densely urbanized and industrialized metropolitan areas such as Istanbul. The rapid growth of Istanbul, particularly towards west with minimal geoscientific information resulted in an overwhelming pressure on the natural environment. In addition, a large earthquake, which is expected to occur in the Marmara Sea within the next 30 years, also pose a threat to the city and its surroundings. In this study, on the basis of the geological, geomorphological and geophysical reconnaissance study, an integrated geoscientific data were collected from the western region of Istanbul and evaluated for geoliazards. The paper focuses on the geological and geomorphological aspects that control the occurrence of some geohazards such as earthquake-induced liquefaction, landslides and flooding. In this context, the geological map of the region was revised and Quaternary deposits were classified into I I units, in detail. Liquefaction-prone areas were evaluated by using geomorphological criteria based on field investigation, by the examination of the available records from 88 bore-holes drilled on recent deposits and by the data from resistivity profiles. The landslides within the region were classified according to their type, relative depth and activity. In addition, fluvial and marine floodprone areas were also delimited within the region. Finally, a series of maps such as landslide inventory maps, and maps showing liquefaction- and flood-prone areas were produced with the aid of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assist in designing further detailed site investigations and to reduce costs by ensuring a more focused approach to strategic planning and site selection.

AB This paper presents results of recent studies on distribution and category of landslides in one section of the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, adjacent to the northern side of the Yarlu Tsangpo Grand Canyon, Tibet, Southwestern China. In the tectonic setting predominated by compression and strike-slipping, active faults are dominant and result in the genesis of the great alpine relief together with fluvial incision and unloading. In this section, with a distance of about 290 kin between Ranwu and Lulang, 34 landslides occurred. Among them, the 12 large and super-large landslides comprise the most dangerous part of the highway system to road users over the past 50 years. The landslides usually occurred in slopes comprised of moraine with a large thickness, fluvio-pluvial and lacustrine deposits and fractured rocks. Based on the examination of the physical geography, structural geology, Quaternary geology, stratigraphy and petrography, this paper presents the temporal-spatial distribution of landslides along the section and classification of them into three types with respect to mechanism and composites of landslides.
   Type 1. Landslide initiated at high elevation and transformed into a distal debris flow damming the river I with a long reoccurrence interval
   Type 2. Landslide at stream banks, in different ranks of mass movements in dissecting layers of moraines
   Type 3. Landslide of fractured rock mass with quick translation movements. Each of the three types is presented by distinctive case examples. Type 1 is Yigong Landslide; type 2 includes Dongjiu Landslide group, 102 Landslide group, Suotong Landslide group, Songzong Landslide; and the type 3 is Layue Landslide. A binary landslide, which is seldom seen in nature and which occurred in the outlet of one creek under the integrative function of fluvial incision and road cut, is also presented. These are distributed in different parts of the area with characterized structural geology, topography and composites (gneiss and Quaternary deposits) with accumulative quantity between Suotong and Dongjiu. The most occurred with frequent and rapid translation, shallow shearing planes, various influential factors and unique triggering factors, and a variable period of reoccurrence with a tendency of increasing magnitude. In this region, six influential factors greatly contribute to their occurrence: (a) intensive neotectonic movements, (b) ongoing alpine canyon relief, (c) earthquakes, (d) heavy precipitation, (e) stream erosion, and (f) human activities, to a certain extent. Mostly, the latter four factors play major roles in triggering landslide occurrence. The earthquake causes the rock and soil to fracture and deform, and tends to be unstable, or cause earth-induced landslides. The heavy rainfall in monsoon seasons which saturates the soil and lower the shearing strength is mostly responsible for the occurrence of landslides. The stream erosion disturbs slope toes causing progressive failure. Road construction and deforestation decrease the natural slope stability. Comments and suggestions on the physical measures for remediation of landslides and safety of highways are also made.

AB Cities are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters due to the concentration of population, buildings and infrastructure. With urbanisation on the rise, particularly in developing countries, the incorporation of disaster management is high on urban agendas as the losses from a single event can destroy decades of development. The main challenge at the moment is to move forward from general policy manifestos to effective networking and case-specific urban disaster mitigation plans. This paper presents the main findings of a research project that aimed at first identifying gaps in current urban planning framework and practices as well developing geographically referenced information products to aid the process of selection of adequate disaster mitigation strategies. The Costa Rican city of Cartago was used as case study since it constitutes a good example of a municipality in a developing country with serious natural hazard threats and where urban plans have been drawn up with deficient or even absent information on potential natural hazards' losses.

AB The general trend in North America, which is agriculturally based, have indicated that prime agricultural lands are being constantly lost to natural hazards such as soil erosion, land degradation, and especially through human activities such as urban development. In order to control and manage these prime agricultural lands, there is a need for improved agricultural land evaluation methods. Lately, a combination of geospatial technologies (GST) such as remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS), and the global positioning system (GPS), and land evaluation methods such as Land Evaluation and Site Assessment (LESA) have shown to be promising tools for land evaluation. Even though numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of integrating land evaluation models with GIS, few studies have combined the popular LESA model with GIS to provide a decision support tool for mangers. The goat of the study is to develop a decision support tool for agricultural land evaluation using geospatial technologies and a LESA model in Black Hawk County, Iowa. Currently, the county is using an Excel-based land evaluation and site assessment system, which lacks a spatial context even though land evaluation factors are spatial in nature. In order to develop a decision support tool, LESA criteria, and relevant data for these criteria were collected from different sources. Then, these data were analyzed using ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software. Finally, a decision support tool was developed by customizing ArcGIS software using Visual Basic Application. The results of the study found that soil productivity, development potentials, and farmland are the major factors in the LESA model in this county. The decision support tool developed in this study is easy to use, accurate, combines spatial and non-spatial data, and saves time and money for the planners in the county over traditional methods.

AB In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch triggered a large number of landslides (mainly debris flows) in Honduras and Nicaragua, resulting in a high death toll and in considerable damage to property. In recent years, a number of risk assessment methodologies have been devised to mitigate natural disasters. However, due to scarcity of funds and lack of specialised personnel few of these methodologies are accessible to developing countries. To explore the potential application of relatively simple and affordable landslide susceptibility methodologies in such countries, we focused on a region in NW Nicaragua which was among the most severely hit during the Mitch event. Our study included (1) detailed field work to produce a high-resolution inventory landslide map at I : 10,000 scale, and (2) a selection of the relevant instability factors from a Terrain Units Map which had previously been generated in a project for rural development. Based on the combination of these two datasets and using GIS tools we developed a comparative analysis of failure-zones and terrain factors in an attempt to classify the land into zones according to the propensity to landslides triggered by heavy rainfalls. The resulting susceptibility map was validated by using a training and a test zone, providing results comparable to those reached in studies based in more sophisticated methodologies. Thus, we provide an example of a methodology which is simple enough to be fully comprehended by non-specialised technicians and which could be of help in landslide risk mitigation through implementation of non-structural measures, such as land planning or emergency measures.

   dilated cardiomyopathy reveals preclinical disease
SO ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE

   ASSOCIATION; GUIDELINES; ADULT; LOCUS; MAPS
AB Background: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is often familial, and apparently healthy relatives may have latent, early, or undiagnosed established disease.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence and natural history of asymptomatic cardiac abnormalities among sampled relatives of unselected patients referred for management of dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Design: Prospective cohort study. Patients: 767 asymptomatic relatives of 189 consecutive unselected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
   Measurements: Clinical evaluation, including history, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, was performed. Participants were classified in accordance with published echocardiographic criteria. Sampled relatives who did not have evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy at the initial evaluation were followed for a median of 57 months (range, 1 to 133 months).
   Results: Of the 767 patients evaluated, 592 (77.2%) were assessed as healthy, 35 (4.6% [95% CI, 3.7% to 7.6%]) had dilated cardiomyopathy, 119 (15.5% [CI, 12.5% to 18.8%]) had left ventricular enlargement without systolic dysfunction, and 21 (2.7% [CI, 1.9% to 4.9%]) had depressed fractional shortening without ventricular dilatation. At follow-up, progression to dilated cardiomyopathy occurred in 13 (10%) relatives with left ventricular enlargement or depressed fractional shortening versus 3 (1.3%) healthy relatives. In a multivariate model, only left ventricular enlargement or depressed fractional shortening independently predicted progression to dilated cardiomyopathy (hazard ratio, 10.0 [CI, 2.8 to 35.5]; P < 0.001).
   Limitations: Because relatives had to be willing to participate and be available geographically, selection bias may have occurred.
   Conclusion: Treatable asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy was identified in 4.6% of asymptomatic relatives. In addition, left ventricular enlargement and depressed fractional shortening were common in asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and were associated with a statistically significant medium-term risk for disease progression. Evaluation of relatives of patients with cardiomyopathy is recommended.

AB Human populations worldwide are vulnerable to natural disasters. Certain conditions-such as geographical location or people's income level-can affect the degree to which natural disasters impact people's homes and livelihoods. This paper suggests that vulnerability to natural disasters increases when local people, scientists, and policymakers do not communicate and trust each other. Additionally, a breakdown in interaction and confidence among these groups can disrupt the implementation of sound science or well-intentioned policies. This case study analyzes how local people, scientists, and government officials responded to glacier hazards in Peru's Cordillera Blanca mountain range. Cordillera Blanca glacier retreat since the late-19th century has triggered some of the world's most deadly avalanches and glacial lake outburst floods. Although a Peruvian glaciology and lakes security office has "controlled' 35 Cordillera Blanca glacial lakes, 30 glacier disasters have killed nearly 30,000 people in this region since 1941. A lack of local faith in government officials and scientists as well as the State's failure to follow scientists' warnings about potential disasters have endangered or led to the death of thousands of local residents, many of which remain living in hazard zones today.

ID MODEL
AB The increased interest for categorising countries at risk calls for an improved methodology allowing comparison of natural hazard impacts at a global level. A disaster is the intersection between a hazardous event, the elements at risk (population, infrastructures) and their vulnerability. In order to associate reported impacts with affected elements and socioeconomic or geophysical contextual parameters, geographical location and extent of hazards is needed. The scope of this paper is to present improved automated procedures for a rapid mapping of large disastrous hazard events (floods, earthquakes, cyclones and volcanoes) using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and available global datasets. Up to 82% of the events and 88% of the reported victims could be geo-referenced and the results highlight both the potentialities and limitations of the methods applied.

TI Methodological considerations for the evaluation of seismic risk on road

SO PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS

DE road; earthquake; seismic risk; natural hazard; vulnerability
AB The recent earthquakes in California and Japan have shown the fundamental role that the road infrastructure plays in emergencies. In fact, only the maintenance of a sufficient level of efficiency can help to quickly reach the affected areas and thus avoid further serious consequences. The necessity of guaranteeing the functionality of the transport network during seismic events therefore requires seismic risk planning extended also to the road infrastructures in order to support the management of post-earthquake emergencies. Analogously it is fundamentally important to have analysis instruments of the road system able to preventatively evaluate the effects of earthquakes in order to identify possible emergencies, therefore preparing a program of intervention to reduce seismic risk on road networks. This paper proposes a methodology for the evaluation of seismic risk of road infrastructures according to the following points:
   Study of seismic hazard of the site for the definition of a seismic scenario using attenuation models in relation to historical seismology and the geological and tectonic characteristics of the territory;
   Analysis of the direct exposure connected to the probability of the presence of road users on the different parts of the network directly exposed to the seismic event;
   Analysis of the indirect exposure relative to the distribution of the population and the infrastructures for which post-earthquake accessibility must be guaranteed;
   Evaluation of the functional vulnerability in relation to the potential replaceability of damaged stretches considering network configuration and geometrical characteristics;
   Evaluation of structural vulnerability of the stretch correlated to the characteristics (structural, mechanical, technological, etc.) of the different components (bridges, embankments, trenches, tunnels) that make up the stretches obtained by the use of correctly elaborated tables for each component.
   The determination of global risk indexes of the single stretches and of the network, evaluated by means of a relationship between the ascertained parameters derived from the investigation of the previous points, provides the necessary information for the definition of mitigation measures to reduce the risk and for management planning before and after disaster. The proposed methodology, which has already been applied to a restricted area, is currently being applied to the province of Catania (Sicily, Italy), which is one of the geographical regions of highest seismic risk in Europe, and its future extension to all of eastern Sicily is foreseeable.

AB Turkey is heavily exposed to natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides and floods. The total loss caused by landslides in terms of affected buildings, in a period of 35 years between 1959 and 1994, constitutes 27% of the entire loss from all natural hazards and is second after earthquakes. There are no other available data on either direct or indirect losses due to landslides on a national scale.
   The General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA) started the 'Turkish Landslide Inventory Mapping Project' in 1997 to improve understanding of regional and national landslide processes. The purpose of the project is to establish landslide inventory maps at medium (1:25,000), regional (1: 100,000) and national (1:500,000) scales. Existing landslides are mapped on 1:25,000 scale topographic base maps by interpretation of aerial photographs and field investigations. The base maps are then digitized and stored in a geographic information system (GIS) database by the Geological Research Department of MTA. Hence, regional- and national-scale landslide maps will be available as well, as the work progresses. Landslides are classified as fall, topple, slide and flow and are broadly characterized as active or inactive. The landslides are also classified according to their relative depths, as shallow (depth < 5 m) and deep-seated (depth > 5 m). The present paper will attempt to describe the project standards and its application to the area of 1:500,000 scale Zonguldak quadrangle. The study area extends to 393081 km(2), and 7.1 % of the area was found to be affected by landslides. A total 10,007 landslides (392 shallow-seated, 8020 2 deep-seated active and 1595 deep-seated inactive) were mapped in the area covering 2768 km(2). Cretaceous flysch, Paleocene-Eocene flysch and Paleocene-Middle Miocene volcanics are the most landslide-prone units and constitute 27.8%, 29.9% and 7.2% of the all landslides, respectively.

AB In this article, I criticize environmental sociology's conventional diagnosis of its methodological situation and overly narrow definition of its field. I argue for a greater engagement with the natural science base and consideration of anthropological approaches. I start with conceptual analysis, identifying the human-environment relationship as a proactive two-way interaction. I then present an outline of global environmental dynamics, highlighting the unequal size of human activities on geosphere and biosphere scale, and the role of the biosphere as manager of the geosphere, this as context for the human population problem. Three types of environmental problems are next identified: urban-industrial, rural-agrarian, and high hazard exposure. These are seen as forming a continuum, with anthropogenic and natural factors synergizing at the centre. I comment on their geographic distribution, noting Europe's limited and specific environmental experience. Lastly I attempt an overview without biological metaphors of the human-environment relationship through time, commenting on its inherent imbalances and how these might be diagnosed. I conclude that sociology's bias to modernity and the West renders it inadequate to the global environmental question. A wider and deeper spacio-temporal consideration is needed, with the whole continuum of environmental problems considered. For this, environmental sociology should seek a synthesis with cultural anthropology centring on the anthropological concept of culture, an approach, I argue, that is accessible through the sociology of Max Weber.

TI A case for adopting a standardized protocol of field and laboratory
   bioassays to evaluate a potential soil termiticide
SO SOCIOBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE protocol; bioassay; soil termiticide; termite
AB The rationale for adopting a new approach to the field testing of potential soil termiticides is advocated on the grounds that current testing methods are limited to termite bioassays and do not address quantitatively the persistence and bioavailability of soil termiticides to foraging subterranean termites over time and in different soil types. Furthermore, the present testing regimes assume field situations of uniform high termite hazard across field sites. Our testing procedures require the random sampling of soil cores from test soil pads (500 x 500 mm) at several geographically different locations. The soil cores from treated and untreated soil pads are returned to the laboratory and half of the samples chemically analyzed using a chromatographic method (HPLC) examined for each year of test period. The bioavailability of termiticide residues in the remaining soil samples are evaluated by tunnelling bioassays using the field collected subterranean termites, Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Both tunnelling distance and mortality are used as indicators of termiticide activity and availability.
   This paper compares the traditional soil test methods with our new approach, which addresses the problems of security with longevity of test, variability of termite hazard levels at different field sites, and a practical method for managing variables in assessing potential soil termiticides. Importantly, this technique prevents the direct destruction of natural populations of subterranean termites or the indirect contamination by contact from soil residues of termiticides applied in and around active termite colonies.

AB A catastrophic landslide dam breach induced debris flow initiated in Da-Cu-Keng stream, Ruifang town, when typhoon Xangsane hit Taiwan on November 1, 2000. Different available methodologies were used to model the natural dam breach induced debris flow and using field topography the hazard zones affected by debris mixtures were delineated. The numerical finite element or finite difference method is time consuming for the simulation of debris flow inundation areas and hence a rules-based GIS (Geographic Information System) analysis is proposed in this study. The model emphasizes the downstream inundated fan-shaped areas covered by debris mixtures through the overflow point. Topography and gradient are assumed to dominate the debris masses deposition mechanism in the GIS analysis. The approach considers the parameters' effects, such as the runout distance, the debris masses magnitude and the inundated areas. The results of this study reveal that the GIS process using the rule-based approach speeds up the processing of delineating the hazard zones and assessment, which can be applied to early-warning and preliminary inundation hazardous mapping.

TI Management of historical seismic data using GIS: The island of Ischia

DE historical seismicity; GIS; seismic hazard; island of Ischia
ID RESURGENCE
AB This paper presents the results of the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in managing information on the effects of earthquakes in historical times on the island of Ischia. The unpublished sources on the Casamicciola earthquake of 28 July 1883 and the extensive bibliography documenting the island's seismicity from 1228 showed the need to proceed towards a type of data storage that would also allow management of the same data. Application of GIS techniques allowed us to insert, extract, handle, manage and analyse the data for the zoning of seismic damage on the island of Ischia. The end-product consists of information layers, such as maps of isoseismals, the damage, and hazard involved, as well as numerical tables associated to maps.
   The study was developed using GIS Arc-View 3.2 software (ESRI) and is structured in thematic vectorial levels and rasters. The overlapping themes constitute a cartographic data base of the island. The damaged sites are located on a map at a scale of 1: 10,000, with all the information on the 1883 earthquake (total number of houses, number of collapsed houses, collapsed or damaged rooms, photographs, plans of buildings, etc.) being associated to each site. The GIS is structured in such a way as to be able to be integrated with further georeferenced data and with other databases. It is thus able to provide support both for in-depth analyses of the dynamic processes on the island and extend the assessment to other natural risks (volcanic, landslides, flooding, etc.).

AB Background HIV contributes substantially to child mortality, but factors underlying these deaths are inadequately described. With individual data from seven randomised mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) intervention trials, we estimate mortality in African children born to HIV-infected mothers and analyse selected risk factors.
   Methods Early HIV infection was defined as a positive HIV-PCR test before 4 weeks of age; and late infection by a negative PCR test at or after 4 weeks of age, followed by a positive test. Mortality rate was expressed per 1000 child-years. We investigated the effect of maternal health, infant HIV infection, feeding practices, and age at acquisition of infection on mortality assessed with Cox proportional hazards models, and allowed for random effects for trials grouped geographically.
   Findings 378 (11%) of 3468 children died. By age 1 year, an estimated 35.2% infected and 4.9% unindected children will have died; by 2 years of age, 52.5% and 7.6% will have died, respectively. Mortality varied by geographical region, and was associated with maternal death (adjusted odds ratio 2.27, 95% CI 1.62-3.19), CD4+ cell counts <200 per &mu;L (1.91, 1.39-2.62), and infant HIV infection (8.16, 6.43-10.33). Mortality was not associated with either ever breastfeeding and never breastfeeding in either infected or uninfected children. In infected children, mortality was significantly lower for those with late infection than those with early infection (0.52, 0.39-0.70). This effect was also seen in analyses of survival from the age at infection (0.74, 0.55-0.99).
   Interpretation These findings highlight the necessity for timely antiretroviral care, for support for HIV-infected women and children in developing countries, and for assessment of prophylactic programmes to prevent MTCT, including child mortality and infection averted.

AB Contemporary natural resource management requires consideration of the social acceptability of management practices and conditions. Agencies wishing to measure, respond to, and influence social acceptability must understand the nuances of public perception regarding controversial issues. This study explores social acceptability judgments about one such issue: reduction of wildland fuel hazards on federal lands in the western United States. Citizens were surveyed in four locations where fire has been a significant ecological disturbance agent and public land agencies propose to reduce wildland fuel levels and wildfire hazards via prescribed burning, thinning, brush removal, and/or livestock grazing. Respondents in different locations differed in their knowledge aboutfire and fuel issues as well in their acceptability judgments. Differences are associated with location-specific social and environmental factors as well as individual beliefs. Results argue against using "one-size-fits-all'' policies or information strategies about fuels management.

SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT

ID COUNTY
AB Earthquakes and tsunamis pose significant threats to Pacific Northwest coastal port and harbor communities. Developing holistic mitigation and preparedness strategies to reduce the potential for loss of life and property damage requires community-wide vulnerability assessments that transcend traditional site-specific analyses. The ability of a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate natural, socioeconomic, and hazards information makes it an ideal assessment tool to support community hazard planning efforts. This article summarizes how GIS was used to assess the vulnerability of an Oregon port and harbor community to earthquake and tsunami hazards, as part of a larger risk-reduction planning initiative. The primary purposes of the GIS were to highlight community vulnerability issues and to identify areas that both are susceptible to hazards and contain valued port and harbor community resources. Results of the GIS analyses can help decision makers with limited mitigation resources set priorities for increasing community resiliency to natural hazards.

ID FISSURES
AB Risk assessment of earth fracture hazards is particularly useful for regulatory, managerial, and decision-making purposes at all levels of government. A "three-map" method that includes intrinsic vulnerability, specific vulnerability, and hazard maps is developed to assess the earth fracture hazards in Yuci City, Shanxi, China. The intrinsic (natural) vulnerability map is based on the assessment of various natural factors by coupling the technologies of a Geographical Information System (GIS) to an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The specific vulnerability map is generated by coupling the technologies of a GIS and an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). According to the overlapping principles of multiple geo-information systems, the hazard map is therefore defined by overlapping the intrinsic and specific vulnerability maps using a spatial-operation function in the GIS. Unlike the intrinsic vulnerability map, the hazard map takes into account human activities and the importance of the area to be assessed. The proposed "three-map" approach is not only scientifically valuable, but provides a more realistic assessment of earth fracture hazards as well.

AB Forests are complex systems with forest ecosystem, resource, stakeholder and policy subsystems. Knowledge about forest systems is always incomplete, and uncertainty pervades decision-making. Forest planning should account for complexity and address uncertainty, using feedback on past outcomes to inform future planning. Complexity in the forest system and uncertainty in planning have a spatial dimension, which can be represented and analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS). These principles apply to both strategic and operational planning. In this paper we present a GIS-based method for spatially analyzing forest planning outcomes and uncertainty (SAFEPLAN). Results obtained for a southeastern BC case study show how this method can be used to identify specific sources of uncertainty and remedies for improving the effectiveness of operational forest planning. Anticipating the effects of recur-ring events on plan outcomes will increase effectiveness of operational planning and will improve the ability of forest managers to achieve the desired results.

ID ACCURACY
AB Landslides are natural hazards that cause havoc to both property and life every year, especially in the Himalayas. Landslide hazard zonation (LHZ) of areas affected by landslides therefore is essential for future developmental planning and organization of various disaster mitigation programmes. The conventional Geographical Information System (GIS)-based approaches for LHZ suffer from the subjective weight rating system where weights are assigned to different causative factors responsible for triggering a landslide. Alternatively, artificial neural networks (ANNs) may be applied. These are considered to be independent of any strict assumptions or bias, and they determine the weights objectively in an iterative fashion. In this study, an ANN has been applied to generate an LHZ map of an area in the Bhagirathi Valley, Himalayas, using spatial data prepared from IRS-1B satellite sensor data and maps from other sources. The accuracy of the LHZ map produced by the ANN is around 80% with a very small training dataset. The distribution of landslide hazard zones derived from ANN shows similar trends as that observed with the existing landslides locations in the field. A comparison of the results with an earlier produced GIS-based LHZ map of the same area by the authors (using the ordinal weight rating method) indicates that ANN results are better than the earlier method.

ID WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN BASIN; SURGES
AB Due to its geographical position, and because it was built at sea level, Venice is extremely sensitive to climate changes and, in the future, risks being submerged as a consequence of the expansion of oceanic water in response to global warming. A key problem is the increasing frequency of storm surges with the sea flooding the city (locally named acqua alta) that has reached an unsustainable level. After careful examination of both proxy documentary and instrumental data, it has been possible to reconstruct the extreme weather conditions and natural hazards, which have taken place in the last two millennia, with particular reference to surges. A key problem with proxy data from written sources is that periods with missing data may be misinterpreted as 'normal', or that inaccurate reporting may lead to duplication or even multiplication of events. For this reason, the accuracy of the proxy data has been checked by comparing it with other known events. An accurate series of the flood surges has been obtained combining instrumental observations (1872-2000) with documentary data for the previous period. The period of minimum solar activity of Sporer (1416-1534) was anomalous for surges. Not only have meteorologically perturbed periods been identified, but also the effects of the accelerated subsidence of the city and of certain works undertaken in the lagoon that varied the exchanges between the sea and the lagoon. The impact of subsidence and of the modified dynamical exchanges of the lagoon on the change in flooding frequency has been established. During the instrumental period, the tide gauge measured a 31-cm rise. The frequency of surges has dramatically increased since the 1960s, reaching about two flooding events per year, the greatest value since 792 AD. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large slope instabilities are gravitational phenomena whose main characteristics are the multi-km 2 area extension and the complex Geometrical, geomorphological and geomechanical settings. Several studies outlined their importance in spatial and temporal occurrence of natural hazards on wide mountain areas and their possible interaction in human activities.
   For the study of large slope instability and deep seated slope Gravitational deformations in the Susa and Aosta Valleys (Western Italian Alps) a complete multiscale program (spatial and temporal) analysis has been performed, giving contributions to the reconstruction and settings of their possible evolution.
   A complex geodatabase has been created, including thematic elements from field-data collection (geomorphology, hydrology, lithology, structural geology) and instability events analysis from data archives and remote sensing images. To facilitate the management of a large amount of collected data a G.I.S. (Geographical Information System) has been developed, including two main levels of information: local and regional.
   Local information is mainly devoted to detailed geothematic mapping of single instability phenomena. Clot Brun case study is presented, where original and derived landslide features have been elaborated through arithmetical and statistical operations. in order to identify different instability zones and to assess displacements and state of activity through-time.
   Regional information collected for a landslide inventory of Aosta Valley (IFFI project) summarizes historical and remote sensing data. combined with metadata from local analysis, in order to assess spatial and temporal hazards. To avoid problems of data accuracy (quality and positioning) due to different source archives, a semi-automatic system for selection and validation of data has been created, based on their spatial characteristics (buffer analysis and control).
   G.I.S. technologies have been used to archive, manage and visualize collected data through 2-D and 3-D models of single case studies and regional distribution of large slope instabilities.

ID HAZARD ZONATION; SAR
AB The northern part of Lantau Island in Hong Kong is undergoing very rapid development following completion of the Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok on the island. This development is adjacent to a range of steeply sloping hills that experience levels of annual rainfall in the range of 2000-2400 mm. Rainfall-induced landslides on this steeply sloping natural terrain are therefore potential hazards to property developments downslope. The objective of this study is to characterize the initiation process and the subsequent travel distance of the landslides resulting from recent rainstorms, by integrating aerial photogrammetry with GIS. These landslides, which occurred during the 18 July 1992 and 4-5 November 1993 rainstorms, were interpreted from sequential aerial photographs. Data on these landslides were collected to form a landslide database. Such data, together with information on geology, slope gradient, elevation, slope aspect, slope shape, and vegetation cover were entered into a Geographical Information System (GIS), to determine the geologic and geomorphologic characteristics of the landslide source and to estimate the travel distance of landslide debris. It is demonstrated that this integrated approach of GIS and aerial photogrammetry could serve as an effective means of landslide characterization.

TI Hurricane Vulnerability in Latin America and The Caribbean: Normalized
   Damage and Loss Potentials
SO NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In late October 1998, the remnants of Hurricane Mitch stalled over Honduras and Nicaragua, killing more than 10,000 people and causing as much as $8.5 billion in damage. While Central America and the Caribbean have a history of natural disasters, the fatalities and destruction caused by Mitch were the greatest in at least several decades, prompting many questions including: What accounts for the extent of these losses? Is Mitch a harbinger of future disasters in the region? and What might be done in response? This paper seeks to shed light on these questions by examining the historical and geographic context of hurricane vulnerability in Latin America and the Caribbean. The paper examines trends in economic and other societal factors that increase vulnerability to hurricanes in Central America and the Caribbean and includes a case study of normalized hurricane losses in Cuba made possible by newly collected damage data published herein. The paper places its findings into the context of policies related to climate change and natural hazards.

AB Background. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse patients from four centres in three continents to determine if differences in long-term outcome of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are explained by clinical and laboratory features at presentation.
   Methods. The study included 711 adults with biopsy-proven IgAN from Glasgow, UK (n = 112), Helsinki, Finland (n=204), Sydney, Australia (n=121) and Toronto, Canada (n = 274). Data collected from time of presentation to a nephrologist were age, gender, 24-h urine protein excretion (UP0),mean arterial pressure (MAP(0)) and creatinine clearance (CrCl0). Outcomes were slope of creatinine clearance (CrCl) and renal survival.
   Results. At presentation there was significant variability in baseline clinical features with patients from Helsinki having the lowest median UP0, lowest MAPO and highest CrCl0, all suggesting milder disease. There was significant variability in renal survival between centres with 10-year actuarial survival of 95.7 87.0, 63.9 and 61.6% in Helsinki, Sydney, Glasgow and Toronto, respectively (P < 0.0001; log rank). Cox proportional hazards model revealed lower age(0) and lower CrCl0 were significant independent predictors of reduced renal survival. In addition, patients from Helsinki and Sydney but not Glasgow had significantly longer renal survival than patients from Toronto. Median slope of CrCl varied by region from -1.24ml/min/year in Helsinki, to -3.99ml/min/ year in Toronto (Kruskal-Wallis H test P < 0.0001). By multivariate analysis older age(0), higher CrCl0 and lower UP0 were independently associated with slower progression. Subjects from Helsinki had a significantly slower deterioration independent of the other clinical parameters at presentation. When the 269 patients presenting with CrCl0 <75ml/min were analysed separately there was no independent centre effect.
   Conclusions. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that geographical variability in long-term outcome of IgAN is explained by lead-time bias and inclusion of milder cases in centres with apparent good outcome, but do not exclude the possibility that some of the variability is due to other factors such as genetics, diet or treatment.

TI Methodology for prediction and estimation of consequences of possible
   atmospheric releases of hazardous matter: "Kursk" submarine study
SO ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT; MODEL
AB There are objects with some periods of higher than normal levels of risk of accidental atmospheric releases (nuclear, chemical, biological, etc.). Such accidents or events may occur due to natural hazards, human errors, terror acts, and during transportation of waste or various operations at high risk. A methodology for risk assessment is suggested and it includes two approaches: 1) probabilistic analysis of possible atmospheric transport patterns using long-term trajectory and dispersion modelling, and 2) forecast and evaluation of possible contamination and consequences for the environment and population using operational dispersion modelling. The first approach could be applied during the preparation stage, and the second-during the operation stage. The suggested methodology is applied on an example of the most important phases (lifting, transportation, and decommissioning) of the "Kursk" nuclear submarine operation.
   It is found that the temporal variability of several probabilistic indicators (fast transport probability fields, maximum reaching distance, maximum possible impact zone, and average integral concentration of Cs-137) showed that the fall of 2001 was the most appropriate time for the beginning of the operation. These indicators allowed to identify the hypothetically impacted geographical regions and territories. In cases of atmospheric transport toward the most populated areas, the forecasts of possible consequences during phases of the high and medium potential risk levels based on a unit hypothetical release (e.g. 1 Bq) are performed. The analysis showed that the possible deposition fractions of 10(-11) (Bq/m(2)) over the Kola Peninsula, and 10(-12) - 10(-13) (Bq/m(2)) for the remote areas of the Scandinavia and Northwest Russia could be observed.
   The suggested methodology may be used successfully for any potentially dangerous object involving risk of atmospheric release of hazardous materials of nuclear, chemical or biological nature.

ID HAZARD; RAINFALL
AB Landslides constitute one of the major natural hazards that could cause significant losses of life and property. Mapping or delineating areas prone to landsliding is therefore essential for land-use activities and management decision making in hilly or mountainous regions. A landslide hazard map can be constructed by a qualitative combination of maps of site conditions, including geology, topography and geomorphology, by statistical methods through correlating landslide occurrence with geologic and geomorphic factors, or by using safety factors from stability analysis. A landslide hazard map should provide information on both the spatial and temporal probabilities of landsliding in a certain area. However, most previous studies have focused on susceptibility mapping, rather than on hazard mapping in a spatiotemporal context. This study aims at developing a predictive model, based on both quasi-static and dynamic variables, to determine the probability of landsliding in terms of space and time. The study area selected is about 13 km(2) in North Lantau, Hong Kong. The source areas of the landslides caused by the rainstorms of 18 July 1992 and 4-5 November 1993 were interpreted from multi-temporal aerial photographs. Landslide data, lithology, digital elevation model data, land cover, and rainfall data were digitized into a geographic information system database. A logistic regression model was developed using lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, slope shape, land cover, and rolling 24 It rainfall as independent variables, since the dependent variable could be expressed in a dichotomous way. This model achieved an overall accuracy of 87.2%, with 89.5% of landslide grid cells correctly classified and found to be performing satisfactorily. The model was then applied to rainfalls of a variety of periods of return, to predict the probability of landsliding on natural slopes in space and time. It is observed that the modelling techniques described here are useful for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of landsliding and can be used by land-use planners to develop effective management strategies.

AB Assessment of landslide hazard often requires a good knowledge of the landslide characteristics and runout mechanics. In this paper, a quasi-three-dimensional model using Lagrangian finite element method (LFEM) is formulated to reproduce the dynamic runout process caused by landslides. A case study of rainfall-induced landslide on a natural slope in 1993 in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, is presented. Voellmy rheology is adopted to characterize the multi-dimensional runout behaviour. For engineering applications, the selection of appropriate rheology and the determination of relevant key parameters associated with the failure mechanisms and runout mechanics are highlighted. Details of the mathematical formulation, particularly with respect to the stability of the numerical scheme and quality control of the mesh, are provided. The close correlation between the calculation results and the field observations shows that, if an appropriate rheological relationship is selected for the simulation, a reasonable description of the runout behaviour can be obtained using the present model. Implications of the potential hazard from natural terrain landslides to downslope development are also discussed. Used in conjunction with Geographical Information System (GIS) database, the model can also be applied to the preliminary hazard zoning of terrain and land-use management in mountainous areas.

AB This paper develops a GIS-based integrated approach to risk assessment in natural hazards, with reference to bushfires. The challenges for undertaking this approach have three components: data integration, risk assessment tasks, and risk decision-making. First, data integration in GIS is a fundamental step for subsequent risk assessment tasks and risk decision-making. A series of spatial data integration issues within GIS such as geographical scales and data models are addressed. Particularly, the integration of both physical environmental data and socioeconomic data is examined with an example linking remotely sensed data and areal census data in GIS. Second, specific risk assessment tasks, such as hazard behavior simulation and vulnerability assessment, should be undertaken in order to understand complex hazard risks and provide support for risk decision-making. For risk assessment tasks involving heterogeneous data sources, the selection of spatial analysis units is important. Third, risk decision-making concerns spatial preferences and/or patterns, and a multicriteria evaluation (MCE)-GIS typology for risk decision-making is presented that incorporates three perspectives: spatial data types, data models, and methods development. Both conventional VICE methods and artificial intelligence-based methods with GIS are identified to facilitate spatial risk decision-making in a rational and interpretable way. Finally, the paper concludes that the integrated approach can be used to assist risk management of natural hazards, in theory and in practice.

AB Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) is threatened across its native range by an exotic fungal pathogen introduced within the last century. Mortality has been extensive, and projected potential range shifts based on impending climate change have revealed further pressures to survival and adaptation for this long-lived, high-elevation conifer. Quantifying genetic variation and the mating system of whitebark pine in its northern range provides a basis for effective conservation measures. Isozyme analysis of vegetative bud tissue revealed high expected heterozygosity (0.262), moderate population differentiation (F-ST = 0.061) and highly significant correlations between observed heterozygosity and geographic variables (R-2 = 0.36, latitude; R-2 = 0.30 longitude), supporting the hypothesis that this species recolonized its current northern range following glacial retreat from several refugia in the Washington and Oregon Cascades and in the northern Rockies. Mating system analysis based on simultaneous isozyme analyses of embryo and haploid megagametophyte tissues found relatively high levels of consanguineous mating and selfing for a conifer (t(m) = 0.73) within populations. Avian seed distribution by the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifragia columbiana Wilson) appears to be the overriding factor influencing genetic patterns: being a mutualistic seed disperser, caches comprised of related seeds develop into clumped stands with strong family substructure. While it is a critical wildlife habitat component, lack of commercial utilization has made in situ adaptation the primary conservation focus. Encouraging regeneration success and nutcracker caching by maintaining natural fire regimes will provide an ecosystem-based conservation solution; however, in the Rocky Mountains between 52degreesN and 47degreesN, disease-resistant individuals should be located and propagated in order to ensure long-term survival of the species in high pathogen hazard areas.

TI Assessing tsunami vulnerability, an example from Herakleio, Crete
SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent tsunami have caused massive loss of life, destruction of coastal infrastructures and disruption to economic activity. To date, tsunami hazard studies have concentrated on determining the frequency and magnitude of events and in the production of simplistic flood maps. In general, such maps appear to have assumed a uniform vulnerability of population, infrastructure and business. In reality however, a complex set of factors interact to produce a pattern of vulnerability that varies spatially and temporally. A new vulnerability assessment approach is described, that incorporates multiple factors (e. g. parameters relating to the natural and built environments and socio-demographics) that contribute to tsunami vulnerability. The new methodology is applied on a coastal segment in Greece and, in particular, in Crete, west of the city of Herakleio. The results are presented within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The application of GIS ensures the approach is novel for tsunami studies, since it permits interrogation of the primary database by several different end-users. For example, the GIS may be used: (1) to determine immediate post-tsunami disaster response needs by the emergency services; (2) to pre-plan tsunami mitigation measures by disaster planners; (3) as a tool for local planning by the municipal authorities or; (4) as a basis for catastrophe modelling by insurance companies. We show that population density varies markedly with the time of the year and that 30% of buildings within the inundation zone are only single story thus increasing the vulnerability of their occupants. Within the high inundation depth zone, 11% of buildings are identified as in need of reinforcement and this figure rises to 50% within the medium inundation depth zone. 10% of businesses are located within the high inundation depth zone and these may need to consider their level of insurance cover to protect against primary building damage, contents loss and business interruption losses.

AB In a prospective observational study 4485 patients from 46 clinical centres in 17 European countries were followed between April 1994 and November 1996. Information on AIDS-defining events (ADEs) were collected together with basic demographic data, treatment history and laboratory results. The centres were divided into four geographical regions (north, central, south-west and south-east) so that it was possible to identify any existing regional differences in ADEs. The regional differences that we observed included a higher risk of all forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections (Tb) and wasting disease in the south-west and an increased risk of infections with the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in the north. In Cox multivariable analyses, where north was used as the reference group, we observed hazard ratios of 6.87, 7.77, 2.29 and 0.16 (P < 0.05 in all cases) for pulmonary Tb, extrapulmonary Tb, wasting disease and MAC respectively in the south-west. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was less commonly diagnosed in the central region (RH = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.79, P = 0.003) and most common in the south-east (RH = 1.04, 95% CI 0.71-1.51, P = 0.85). Comparisons with a similar 'AIDS in Europe' study that concentrated on the early phase of the epidemic reveal that most of the regional differences that were observed in the 1980s still persist in the mid-1990s.

AB Geomorphological research has played an important role in the development and implementation of soil erosion assessment tools, Because policy and management approaches include the use of soil erosion assessment tools, soil erosion research directly affects the public in terms of providing information on natural hazards and human impacts, and also as the basis for regulatory policy on land management. For example, soil loss calculations and geomorphological expertise are used to support soil conservation planning, both through agricultural legislation that defines maximum tolerable soil loss rates, and through federal and local legislation that requires soil erosion controls on many construction sites. To be useful for decision makers, soil erosion models must have simple data requirements, must consider spatial and temporal variability in hydrological and soil erosion processes, and must be applicable to a variety of regions with minimum calibration. The growing use of erosion models and Geographic Information Systems (IS) in local to regional scale soil and water conservation raises concerns about how models are used. This has prompted interest in methods to assess how models function at management scales and with the types of data that are commonly available to users. A case study of a GIS-based soil erosion assessment toot using the process-based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) shows that using commonly available data rather than research grade data can have (predictably) a significant impact on model results. If model results are then used in management decisions, it is critical to assess whether the scale and direction of variation in results will affect management and policy decisions. Geomorphologists provide unique perspectives on soil erosion and can continue to affect policy through soil erosion research, This research should focus on fundamental processes, but equally important is continued development and evaluation of models that are matched to real world data availability, geomorphic settings, and information needs.

AB The Northern Adriatic Coastland, between the cities of Monfalcone and Cattolica, is characterized by locations of great tourist interest, such as the Venice Lagoon and the Romagna Riviera, and areas with a very precarious environmental setting, such as the Valli di Comacchio, and the Po River Delta. Therefore, the coastal management and the design of new defence works of the littoral have to be made with the utmost care, possibly with the aid of numerical predictions of the coastal morphodynamics and the flood risk analysis of the lowland involved. In the study area, land may subside due to sediment natural compaction and subsurface fluid (water and gas) withdrawal. At the same time, littoral transport of solid material can contribute appreciably to change the shore morphology. Mean sea level may rise permanently due to global climate change (eustatism) and occasionally due to tides and intensive storm events. The predictions of each individual process is obtained using various ad hoc mathematical models and the outcome of the numerical simulations are managed with a GIS (geographical information system). Coastline evolution until the year 2100 is investigated and risk factor maps of the low-lying coastal areas are generated which account for the hazard of the expected event, and the land economic value and vulnerability.

AB Land-use systems are highly complex, and any modelling effort of land-use change should account for the complexity of the system. Furthermore, when the aim is to produce realistic scenarios, land-use models should be both spatially and temporally explicit. Using an example of such a model, the conversion of land-use and its effects modelling framework, we explore near-future land-use changes in Central America. Besides a Base and an Optimistic scenario, which assumes yields to approach the present maximum in the region and assumes export and import to increase, focus is on projection of the long-term effects of an extreme event. Scenario assumptions are based on actual data that became available after hurricane Mitch struck the continent. Resulting maps of the Base and Optimistic scenario demonstrate how slow and gradual changes at the national level translate into highly dynamic patterns of land-use change when allocated spatially. Hot-spots of change prove relatively insensitive to changes in income. Particularly land-use change patterns of the most common land-use types, pasture, annual crops. and natural vegetation, differed between both scenarios. The results of the Natural Hazard scenario for Honduras separately as well as for Central America as a whole clearly indicate that the effects of a hurricane on land-use patterns, though initially strong, are likely to largely disappear within a period of 10 years. Concepts from ecology regarding complexity as developed by Holling are used to illustrate the behaviour of the Central American land-use system. Practicabilities for policy makers are indicated, but similar studies and spatially explicit models are needed from sociology and economics to complete our understanding of the long-term effects of an extreme event.

AB This paper describes the use of geostatistical analysis and GIS techniques to assess gas emanation hazards. The Mt. Vulsini volcanic district was selected for this study because of the wide range of natural phenomena locally present that affect gas migration in the near surface. In addition, soil gas samples that were collected in this area should allow for a calibration between the generated risk/hazard models and the measured distribution of toxic gas species at surface. The approach used during this study consisted of three general stages. First data were digitally organized into thematic layers, then software functions in the GIS program "ArcView" were used to compare and correlate these various layers, and then finally the produced "potential-risk" map was compared with radon soil gas data in order to validate the model and/or to select zones for further, more-detailed soil gas investigations.

AB Steep terrain and high frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. The present article reports on the use of a geographical information system (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical correlations between landslide frequency and terrain variables on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. This database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model to predict landslide susceptibility, Slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land use cover are indicated as statistically significant in predicting landslide susceptibility, whereas slope morphology and proximity to drainage line are not important and are thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted landslide susceptibility. This study demonstrates that landslide susceptibility can be effectively modeled by using GIS technology and logistic multiple regression analysis.

AB Steep terrain and high a frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. This paper reports on the use of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical relations of landslide frequency with the physical parameters contributing to the initiation of landslides on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The horizontal travel length and the angle of reach, defined as the angle of the line connecting the head of the landslide source to the distal margin of the displaced mass, are used to describe runout behavior of landslide mass. For all landslides studied, the horizontal travel length of landslide mass ranges from 5 to 785 in, with a mean value of 43 in, and the average angle of reach is 27.7degrees. This GIS database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model for predicting slope instability. It is indicated that slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land-use are statistically significant in predicting slope instability, while slope morphology and proximity to drainage lines are not important and thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope instability. The results of this study demonstrate that slope instability can be effectively modeled by using GIS technology and logistic multiple regression analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID ERROR
AB The research examines the incompatibility between resolution and scale of spatial data in a spatial modelling environment and the resolution and scale of human spatial decision-making. This incompatibility is rarely considered when a geographic information systems (GIS) is applied to natural hazard risk assessment. However, the ultimate success of a risk management project should be assessed in the context of improved decision-making. Decision Utility is an emerging theme in GIS literature that focuses on cognitive issues of GIS and human interactions. The research presents a technique for flood risk modelling using GIS and digital elevation models to map relative risk in urban communities. The study is based on Cairns located in far northern Australia. The risk model accounts for uncertainties inherent in the elevation data by adapting an existing error simulation technique. Techniques for making spatial model assumptions and model error explicit to flood risk managers are introduced and evaluated for risk management decision-making. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Montane (alpine) areas are generally of high value for nature conservation. Such environments and the habitats they support are dynamic and often fragile. They are vulnerable to disturbance from a range of human activities and are responsive to climate changes over short and long timescales. Biodiversity and conservation values are closely linked to geological history, geomorphological processes and soils, and it is crucial that management systems are based on understanding these links.
   There are many similarities between the Cairngorm Mountains (Scotland), the Giant Mountains (Czech Republic) and Abisko Mountains (Sweden) in terms of geology, geomorphology, ecology, links with biodiversity and high conservation importance. Comparable pressures and management issues involve, to varying degrees, a history of human use and impacts from deforestation, pasturing, grazing, recreation and atmospheric pollution. Landscape change therefore involves a complex interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors. Managing such change requires better understanding of the geo-ecological processes involved and the factors that determine landscape sensitivity. This is illustrated through a simple framework and examples from the three areas. Comparison of landscape sensitivity between similar montane areas, but in different geographic locations and climatic environments, should allow more informed management planning and a precautionary approach in advance of further changes in human activity and from predicted global warming scenarios.

AB This paper deals with the development of a technique for mapping landslide susceptibility using a geographical information system (GIS), with particular reference to landslides on natural terrain. The method has been applied to Lantau Island, the largest outlying island within the territory of Hong Kong. Landslide susceptibility in the study area is related to a number of terrain variables, viz., lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, land cover, and distance to drainage line. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was carried out to generate the principal axes that are linear combinations of these terrain variables using occurrence data of landslides and terrain variables. A GIS is used to project the values of the principal axes, and subsequently to relate these principal axes to landslide susceptibility by logistic regression modeling. The spatial landslide susceptibility response in the study area can then be obtained by applying this logistic regression model to the study area. The results from this study indicate that such a GIS-based model is useful and suitable for the scale adopted in this study.

AB A geological disaster occurs when natural geological processes impact on our activities, either through loss of life or injury or through economic loss. A geological hazard is a potential disaster. Geological hazard in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador was studied by archival research using a variety of sources to document the historical record of disaster. This record, although undoubtedly incomplete and selective, demonstrates that the province was affected by numerous geological disasters that inflicted a major economic and social cost. At least 80 people have been killed in Newfoundland and Labrador since 1863 in such incidents, including debris flows, rockfalls, avalanches, and tsunamis. Many Newfoundland communities have developed at the base of steep slopes and are therefore prone to landslides and avalanches or are built adjacent to the coast and are susceptible to storm damage. The economic cost is difficult to estimate, but remedial measures for individual events range from Can$ 20 000 for the construction of 50 m of gabions and retaining walls to Can$ 3 000 000 for community-level coastal flood-protection measures. Many of the documented geological disasters were unavoidable and were the inevitable result of geography. However, some were predictable and therefore preventable, either because a similar event had previously occurred in the same area or because geological factors, such as rapid coastal erosion or rising relative sea levels, were not considered during the planning process. The identification of serious avalanche and rockfall hazards in the Battery, St. John's, has led to installation of protective measures. Archival research methods provide a cheap, effective, and useful means of defining regional geological hazard.

AB A cooperative research center based in Townsville, Australia, has completed almost 6 yrs of applied and strategic research, education, and extension in support of conservation and ecologically sustainable use of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. One cornerstone of its success has been the involvement of scientists, representatives from industry, and managers in project development, conduct. and knowledge transfer. Another cornerstone is its interdisciplinary mix of research themes: socioeconomic, technological, and biophysical. We are documenting where, when. and how people currently perceive, use, and benefit from the World Heritage Area and its resources, and how these may change under various future scenarios. We are seeking cost-effective ways for users to meet regulations on structures and wastewater and ballast-water disposal intended to protect the environment. This is done through a combination of critical assessments of the perceived hazard and development of guidelines that reflect that hazard. We are working to evaluate our network of no-take areas in terms of capacity to protect biodiversity and enhance regional fish stocks. We are commencing a parallel socioeconomic impact assessment to took at the effects of different options for closures on fishing communities. Since we will never be able to do biodiversity surveys over more than a small percentage of the entire World Heritage Area, we are developing geographic and physical surrogates to help define 'bioregions' to support planning for the distribution and size of no-take zones. We are linking with catchment scientists to assess the extent of cumulative and individual extreme runoff events. We are using spatial risk-assessment tools to map risks and return periods of impact on coral reefs by unmanageable and/or natural impacts such as floods, cyclones, and crown-of-thorns starfish, One of the major lessons learned has been that the involvement of research users in the research process has improved 'ownership' of the results of the research, and thus its capacity to effect social change in policy and management areas.

AB A geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning often requires a large amount of spatial information. Geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related information, providing the ability to integrate multiple layers of information and to derive additional information. A GIS-aid to the geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning is illustrated for the urban area of Lanzhou City and its vicinity in Northwest China. This evaluation incorporates topography, surficial and bedrock geology, groundwater conditions, and historic geologic hazards. Urban land-use is categorized according to the types of land-use and projects planned, such as high-rise building, multi-storey building, low-rise building, waste disposal, and natural conservation. Multi-criteria analysis is performed to evaluate development suitability of the geo-environment for each category, according to appropriately measured and weighted factors. A suitability map for each category is developed using an algorithm that combines factors in weighted linear combinations. It is demonstrated that the GIS methodology has high functionality for geo-environmental assessment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the past efforts to prevent catastrophic losses from natural hazards have largely been undertaken by individual property owners based on site-specific evaluations of risks to particular buildings. Public efforts to assess community vulnerability and encourage mitigation have focused on either aggregating site-specific estimates or adopting standards based upon broad assumptions about regional risks. This paper develops an alternative, intermediate-scale approach to regional risk assessment and the evaluation of community mitigation policies. Properties are grouped into types with similar land uses and levels of hazard, and hypothetical community mitigation strategies for protecting these. properties are modeled like investment portfolios. The portfolios consist of investments in mitigation against the risk to a community posed by a specific natural hazard and are defined by a community's mitigation budget and the proportion of the budget invested in locations, of each type.
   The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated through an integrated assessment of earthquake-induced lateral-spread ground failure risk in the Watsonville, California area. Data from the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 are used to model lateral-spread ground failure susceptibility. Earth science and economic data are combined and analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The portfolio model is then used to evaluate the benefits of mitigating the risk in different locations. Two mitigation policies one that prioritizes mitigation by land use type and the other by hazard zone, are. compared with a status quo policy of doing no further mitigation beyond that which already exists. The portfolio representing the hazard zone role yields a higher expected return than the land use portfolio does; however. the hazard zone portfolio experiences a higher standard deviation. Therefore, neither portfolio is clearly preferred. The two mitigation policies both reduce expected losses and increase overall expected community wealth compared to the status quo policy.

AB The diversity of the research in earth sciences leads to a multisource approach to investigate the surroundings of Taiwan. Various data sets combined by a Geographical Information System (GIS) enable us to propose an integrated neotectonic map of onshore-offshore Taiwan. Several technical problems arise during the compilation of this map, such as the homogeneity of scales, projections and geodetic systems used, the validity and precision of each data set (line and pixel) and document, and the integration of qualitative and quantitative documents.
   Various types of information are taken into account in this approach, such as topography and bathymetry, geology (lithology, structure), geophysics (gravimetry, magnetism, etc.), geodesy (levelling, GPS, etc.), remote sensing and field works. This multisource approach has been applied to data sets both onland and offshore Taiwan, and has resulted in a preliminary neotectonic map of onshore-offshore Taiwan. This map provides a better comprehension of the geodynamic phenomena that affect Taiwan, and contributes significantly to the relations of the offshore structures and their corresponding reactivated extensional structures onshore (for instance, the Tainan, Taihsi, Okinawa, and Huatung basins).
   This document should benefit both academic research (structural and active fault maps) as well as the applied geological implications (such as natural hazards mapping and evaluation of geotechnic works).

AB For the last 20 years, human-wildlife conflicts have been rapidly increasing in towns. Although people want "greener" cities, the expansion of disliked species causes problems that are difficult to manage and to reduce. The complexity of the numerous factors involved in these human-wildlife relations needs the development of a comprehensive tool for urban planners. Today, with the development of computers and geographical information systems, it is easier to analyze and combine different spatial data as methods used for the management of risks in studies of natural hazards. Here we present a method for assessing and mapping the risk in cases of human-wildlife conflict. An application to starling management in a town in western France will show the efficiency of our methods to combine information given by a network of experts and to highlight higher risk sites. The map of risk provides a spatial result useful for comprehension, communication between people and agencies, and public education.

   intensity of significant exposures
SO NATURAL HAZARDS

AB Natural hazards are becoming increasingly significant these days. There is a need for documentation that concisely presents the type and magnitude of natural hazards as an aid to political and economic decision making. With the aim of presenting the global distribution of exposure to the most significant natural hazards as objectively as possible, Munich Re's Geoscience Research Group published its first World Map of Natural Hazards in 1978. After being revised in 1988, the map was completely reworked and extensively expanded in 1998. The results of earlier work and the latest findings in scientific literature were drawn together and presented in a form that practitioners find both accessible and - bearing in mind the needs of the insurance technicians in particular - readily usable.
   In the production of this third edition, all the basic data were for the first time recorded, adjusted, and analysed with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS). The resulting map in DIN A0 format (841x: 1189mm) and the 30-cm globe were produced exclusively with the techniques of digital cartography.
   A main map and four auxiliary maps present the following types of hazards together with background information:
   . Earthquake and vulcanism (shaking risk, Mexico-City-effect, tsunami, volcanic activity, plate tectonics).
   . Windstorm (tropical cyclone, extratropical storm, regional storm, tornado, hail, and lightning).
   . Flood (storm surge, severe rainfall).
   . Marine hazards (high waves, pack ice, and iceberg drift).
   . Effects of El Nino and climate change.
   In particular, hazard information has been stated, as far as possible, as numbers which can be checked and be used directly in insurance calculations. Hazard is often understood as a quantity that relates the occurrence/frequency and intensity of an event to a specific time interval and so is usually expressed in terms of a probability. Whenever possible, therefore, the hazard information on the world map has three essential components - intensity, frequency and reference period.
   The map comes with an accompanying brochure, which contains a description of the methods and scales used as well as a comprehensive catalogue of major natural catastrophes throughout the world.
   A considerably extended CD-ROM version of the World Map of Natural Hazards with numerous additional functionalities is also available now.

AB Within the framework of a doctoral thesis in geography, we endeavored to draw up the first: map showing hail risk in France. The creation of this map is mainly based on the data of hail measuring networks. This map is corroborated, moreover, by the analysis of hail damage maps. Insurance data used to measure relative hail damage are the base premium rate levels expressed as a percentage of assets insured on a single crop, in this case grapes. These levels reflect well, over the long term, the regional hierarchy of damage, without it being necessary to correlate them directly in terms of frequency and intensity of hail. The regions that suffer the most hail stretch from the southwest to the east-central area of France, passing through the Massif Central. One must also note the southern Alps as a strongly hail-prone region. From the diagonal line of high hail risk emerge two gradients of decreasing intensity and frequency of hail. Toward the west, the risk of hail diminishes strongly, attaining a minimum level in Brittany and on the English Channel coast. Toward the southeast, hail diminishes near the Mediterranean coast. The climatological explanations of this map are so far only hypotheses. Hail is not the exclusive feature of a single climate; it seems on the contrary to be the hallmark of regions of climatic contact. The line of maximal hail risk is situated at the frontier between the oceanic and Mediterranean influences. This conflict is readily measurable in the southwest part of France where the pyrenees channel the Mediterranean influences at low levels. The map of hail risk is also the reflection of the probability of southwestern Row at high altitudes. In the east-central area of France (around Lyon), the local topography can amplify hail energy especially on leeward slopes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Geomagnetic variations of partly interplanetary origin, with cyclic signatures in human affairs and pathology include the incidence of various diseases, regarding which this study of healthy subjects attempted to determine an underlying mechanism by worldwide archival and physiological monitoring, notably of heart rate variability (HRV). In the past half-century, the possible health and other hazards of natural, solar variability-driven temporal variations in the earth's magnetic field have become a controversial subject in view of the inconsistent results. Some well-documented claims of associations between geomagnetic storms and myocardial infarction or stroke have been rejected by a study based on more comprehensive data analyzed by rigorous methods - covering, however, only part of a solar cycle in only part of a hemisphere. It seems possible that inter-solar cycle and geographic variability, if not geographic differences, may account for discrepancies. Herein, we examine the start of a planetary study on any influence of geomagnetic disturbances that are most pronounced in the auroral oval, on human HRV. The magnetic field variations exhibit complex spectra and include the frequency band between 0.001-10 Hz, which is regarded as ultra-low frequency by physicists. Since the 'ultra-low-frequency' range, like other endpoints used in cardiology, refers to much higher frequencies than the about-yearly changes that are here shown to play a role in environmental-organismic interactions revealed by HRV, the current designations used in cardiology are all placed in quotation marks to indicate the need for possible revision. Whether or not this suggestion has an immediate response, we have pointed to a need for the development of instrumentation and software that renders the assessment of circadian, infradian and even infra-annual (truly low frequency) modulations routinely feasible. HRV was examined on the basis of nearly continuous 7-day records by ECG between December 10, 1998, and November 2, 2000, on 19 clinically healthy subjects, 21 to 54 years of age, in Alta, Norway. A geomagnetic record was obtained from the Aurora[ Observatory of the University of Tromso. First, frequency-domain measures of HRV were compared for each person in 24-hour spans of high geomagnetic disturbance versus quiet conditions. Second, cross-spectra between geomagnetic activity and HRV measures were quantified via the squared coherence spectrum using 7-day time series. A 7.5% increase in the 24-hour average of heart rate, HR (P = 0.00020) and a decrease in HRV were documented on days of high geomagnetic disturbance. The decrease in HRV was validated statistically for the 'total frequency', 'TF' endpoint (18.6% decrease, P = 0.00009). The decrease in spectral power was found primarily in the 'circaminutan frequency', 'VLF' (21.9% decrease, P < 0.000001) in conjunction with the 'minutes-to-hours' component, ultra-low-frequency, 'ULF' (15.5% decrease, P = 0.00865) and circadecasecundan 'low frequency', 'LF' (14.2% decrease, P = 0.00187) regions of the spectrum. Power-law scaling of the power spectra did not show any statistically significant difference. It is noteworthy that most of the decrease in HRV, except for the circaminutan (VLF) component, was observed only in the season in which sunshine alternated with darkness (D/L), a finding suggesting a mechanism influenced by the alternation of light and darkness.
   The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception was also supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged coherence at frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations (with periods ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed with a statistical significance (P < 0.000001) among the three natural lighting conditions, the association being weaker during L/L or D/D than during D/L. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of the circadian and circasemidian frequencies in relation to the alternation of sunshine with darkness or rather circannual rhythm stage. In conclusion, evidence is provided herein that an alteration of HRV is most apparent in the circaminutan ('VLF') region, which is clinically important, because a reduction in its power is a predictor of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The circadecasecundan ('LF') component of HRV also decreased in association with geomagnetic disturbance, which may reflect an episodic alteration of arterial pressure related to changes in geomagnetic activity. Lastly, our study suggests the existence of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception mechanism in humans involving mainly the Pc 6 band of the magnetic field.

ID STABILITY MODEL; HAZARD; ZONATION
AB Steep terrain and the high frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. For example, more than 800 slope failures were triggered by a rainstorm in November 1993 on Lantau island, Hong Kong. Maps of recent landslides interpreted from aerial photographs, in combination with a geographical information system, were used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of landslides, with particular reference to such physical parameters as lithology, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, vegetation cover, and proximity to drainage line, all of which are considered to be influential in the occurrence of landslides. A stepwise logistic regression model was obtained between landslide susceptibility and the above mentioned physical parameters. The study area has been classified into five classes of relative landslide susceptibility, namely. very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, based on this methodology.

ID GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
AB During the past two decades there have been a wide range of applications for decision-making linking multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and geographic information systems (GIS). However, limited literature reports the development of MCE-GIS software, and the comparison of various MCE-GIS approaches. This paper introduces an MCE-GIS program called MCE-RISK for risk-based decision-making. It consists of a series of modules for data standardisation, weighting, MCE-GIS methods. and sensitivity analysis. The program incorporates different MCE-GIS methods. including weighted linear combination (WLC), the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and compromise programming (CP), enabling comparisons between different methods for the same decision problem to be made. An example of decision-making for determining priority areas for a bushfire hazard reduction burning is examined. After implementing the alternative MCE-GIS methods, and comparing final outputs and the computational difficulty involved in the analysis, WLC is recommended. Some caveats on using MCE-GIS methods art: also dis cussed. Although the development of MCE-RISK and its application reported in this paper are specific to risk-based decisionmaking in natural hazards, the program can be used for other environmental decision applications. such as environmental impact assessment and land-use planning.

TI Land-use management using a soil survey geographic database for Finney
   County, Kansas
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL

DT Article
ID INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; GIS; FOREWORD
AB The determination of best management practices for land resources is often complicated by the lack of a means for evaluation and lack of quality data. Soil surveys are an important source of data that can be used to improve farm and ranch planning and environmental protection. In this study, we examined the use of a soil survey geographic (SSURGO) database within a geographic information system (GIS) coupled with remote sensing data for land-use management in Finney County, Kansas. The objectives were (i) to identify landuse change; (ii) to evaluate the influence of soil, groundwater, and physiography on land use; and (iii) to assess land-use potential and present management alternatives. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for 1987, 1989, and 1992 were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper data. These LULC layers were manipulated with layers: organic matter content, thickness, and texture of the surface soil horizon; land capability class; aquifer thickness (AT); and physiography. Tire acreage of fallow land decreased and the acreage of grassland increased from 1987 to 1992 because of an increase in the acreage of land used in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Broad cropping patterns (irrigated vs. nonirrigated) did not change significantly between 1987 and 1992 and were related to AT. Some currently cropped areas had high erosion potential, whereas some grasslands had relatively low erosion hazards. These grasslands could be used as alternatives for cropping. The study demonstrates the potential of using SSURGO within a GIS coupled with remote sensing information in planning and management for natural resources.

AB Losses from environmental hazards have escalated in the past decade, prompting a reorientation of emergency management systems away from simple postevent response. There is a noticeable change in policy, with more emphasis on loss reduction through mitigation, preparedness, and recovery programs. Effective mitigation of losses from hazards requires hazard identification, an assessment of all the hazards likely to affect a given place, and risk-reduction measures that are com patible across a multitude of hazards. The degree to which populations are vulnerable to hazards, however, is not solely dependent upon proximity to the source of the threat or the physical nature of the hazard-social factors also play a significant role in determining vulnerability. This paper presents a method for assessing vulnerability in spatial terms using both biophysical and social indicators. A geographic information system was utilized to establish areas of vulnerability based upon twelve environmental threats and eight social characteristics for our study area, Georgetown County, South Carolina. Our results suggest that the most biophysically vulnerable places do not always spatially intersect with the most vulnerable populations. This is an important finding because it reflects the likely "social costs" of hazards on the region. While economic losses might be large in areas of high biophysical risk, the resident population also may have greater safety nets (insurance, additional financial resources) to absorb and recover from the loss quickly. Conversely, it would take only a moderate hazard event to disrupt the well-being of the majority of county residents (who are more socially vulnerable, but perhaps do not reside in the highest areas of biophysical risks) and retard their longer-term recovery from disasters. This paper advances our theoretical and conceptual understanding of the spatial dimensions of vulnerability It further highlights the merger of conceptualizations of human environment relationships with geographical techniques in understanding contemporary public policy issues.

AB Pesticide pollution of surface waters represents a considerable hazard for the aquatic environment. However, the mean amount of pesticides reaching the water resources vanes considerably between regions and depends highly upon application rates, chemical characteristics of pesticides and natural conditions during application. In this study a model was developed which estimates loss of 42 active ingredients applied to 11 field crops, vineyards and orchards along each non-point source path of entry (subsurface drains, runoff and spray drift). A spatially and temporally differentiated data set of application rates and periods was compiled for each active ingredient and target culture to enable the modeling of pesticide transport. The model results are provided in digital raster format (100 mx 100 m) within a geographic information system (GIS). The calculated pesticide loads in surface waters were compared with measured loads from different catchments in Germany. Both data sets agreed as to the order of magnitude, nevertheless due to the scale of the study the estimated loads cannot be interpreted as absolute values and only differences between active ingredients, regions and application periods should be assessed.

AB Volcanic catastrophes constitute a major problem in many developing and developed countries. In recent years population growth and the expansion of settlements and basic supply lines (e.g., water, gas, etc.) have greatly increased the impact of volcanic disasters. Correct land-use planning is fundamental in minimising both loss of life and damage to property. In this contribution Geographical Information Systems (GIS), linked with remote sensing technology and telecommunications/warning systems, have emerged as one of the most promising tools to support the decision-making process. Some GIS are presented for two volcanic areas in Italy, Mt. Etna and Vesuvius. GIS role in risk management is then discussed, keeping in mind the different volcanic scenarios of effusive and explosive phenomena. Mt. Etna system covers a large area (more than 1,000 km(2)) potentially affected by effusive phenomena (lava flows) which cause damage to both houses and properties in general. No risk to life is expected. The time-scales of lava flows allow, at least in principle, modification of the lava path by the building of artificial barriers. Vesuvius shows typically an explosive behaviour. In the case of a medium size explosive eruption, 600,000 people would potentially have to be evacuated from an area of about 200 km(2) around the Volcano, since they are exposed to ruinous, very fast phenomena like pyroclastic surges and flows, lahars, ash fallout, etc. Ash fallout and floods/lahars are also expected in distal areas, between Vesuvius and Avellino, downwind of the volcano. GIS include digital elevation models, satellite images, volcanic hazard maps and vector data on natural and artificial features (energy supply lines, strategic buildings, roads, railways, etc.). The nature and the level of detail in the two data bases are different, on the basis of the different expected volcanic phenomena. The GIS have been planned: (a) for volcanic risk mitigation (hazard, value, vulnerability and risk map assessing), (b) to provide suitable tools during an impending crisis, (c) to provide a basis for emergency plans.

AB Researchers from The University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, and from the Geographical Survey Institute (GSI), Japan, have commenced a joint project to develop, deploy and test an innovative hardware/software system design for an automatic, continuously-operated ground deformation monitoring system based on low-cost GPS receiver technology. Conventional continuously-operated GPS (CCPS) networks, such as the one established in Japan by GSI to precisely measure earth surface movement, are very expensive. The high cost being primarily due to the fact that dual-frequency receivers are used. Japan's nationwide GEONET network is the world's largest, numbering nearly 1000 receiver stations, with an average station spacing of the order of 30 km. In order to densify such CGPS networks (important when high spatial resolution for the monitoring of the deformation phenomenon is required), and to promote the use of the CGPS technique in lesser developed countries, a significantly cheaper system architecture is needed. The proposed design is an integrated, dual-mode network consisting of low-cost, single-frequency GPS receivers across the area of interest, surrounded by a sparser network of dual-frequency GPS receivers. Initial tests of data collected at selected stations in the GEONET network have already shown that through enhanced data processing algorithms a CGPS network containing both single-frequency and dual-frequency receivers would be able to deliver better than centimetre level accuracies, at considerably lower cost than present systems based exclusively on dual-frequency instrumentation. This paper reports the results of the first field test of this new CGPS system design, in the Tsukuba area of Japan, in August 1999. The test network consisted of: (a) several stations of the GEONET network surrounding (b) an inner network of four single-frequency Canadian Marconi GPS receivers installed by UNSW researchers. The data from both the GEONET and the UNSW receivers were processed using a specially modified version of the Bernese GPS Software Package. The software first processes the GEONET GPS station data in order to generate empirical corrections which are then applied to the double-differenced data of the GPS baselines located within the test area enclosed by the dual-frequency CGPS stations. These corrections have the effect of improving baseline solution accuracy by up to an order of magnitude, even for baselines ranging up to 100 km in length. The baselines connecting the inner network to the surrounding GEONET stations are processed in a number of modes, including 24 hr files (as is the standard practice for geodynamic applications) and hourly data files (as in volcano deformation monitoring applications). The results indicate that single-frequency-with-correction processing can achieve accuracies of better than 5 mm in the horizontal components and 3 cm in height, while the dual-frequency results can achieve accuracies better than 2 mm in the horizontal components and 6 mm in height. In the authors' opinion, for certain geodynamic applications there are no significant differences between the single-frequency-with-correction results and the dual-frequency results, especially for the horizontal components.

AB The Yorkshire drought of 1995 was the most extreme climate event faced by the English and Welsh water industry since its privatization in 1989. As an emblem of crisis in privatized water management, and as a potential signal of climate change, the 1995 drought hits motivated change in water regulation and management. In this paper I challenge conventional interpretations of the 1995 water supply crisis as a natural hazard or as a result of managerial ineptitude. Drought is conceptualized as the production of scarcity, an outcome of three interrelated practices: meteorological modeling, demand forecasting, and corporate restructuring and the regulatory "game." These practices are situated within an analysis of the context of;he regulatory implications of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. I explore the simultaneously natural, social, and discursive elements of water scarcity and situate them within an analysis of privatization as regulation, rather than deregulation. This analysis brings insights developed in debates over "real" regulation and regulation theory to bear on nature-society analysis, while extending this debate through theorizing regulation as, in part, a discursive practice. The ensuing rereading of drought challenges conventional interpretations of environmental crisis, raises questions about the implications of water industry privatization, and emphasizes the need to account for the role of the state and the intricacies of "real" regulation in analyses of resource management.

AB Mating can increase an individual's risk of mortality by predation. In response to predation hazards, males in some species court females less often, but alternatively engage in coerced copulations more frequently and females become less selective. Such predator-mediated shifts in mating tactics may result in higher lea els of multiple inseminations in females and, thus, in greater frequencies of females with broods of mixed paternity. We tested this hypothesis using two polymorphic microsatellite loci to estimate conservatively multiple paternity in broods of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) originating from ten natural populations that have evolved under different fish predation regimes in Trinidad. The frequency of broods that were multiply sired was significantly greater on average in populations experiencing high predation pressure compared to populations experiencing a relatively low predation risk. These results suggest that the intensity of male sperm competition covaries geographically with predation pressure in this species and that the local risk of predation mediates the opportunity for sexual selection within populations.

TI Use of GIS technology in the prediction and monitoring of landslide

SO NATURAL HAZARDS
LA English
DT Article
DE GIS technology; landslides; natural hazards; predictive models
ID MODELS
AB Technologies such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have raised great expectations as potential means of coping with natural disasters, including landslides. However, several misconceptions on the potential of GIS are widespread. Prominent among these is the belief that a landslide hazard map obtained by systematic data manipulation within a GIS is assumed to be more objective than a comparable hand-made product derived from the same input data and founded on the same conceptual model. Geographical data can now be handled in a GIS environment by users who are not experts in either GIS or natural hazard process fields. The reality of the successful application of GIS within the landslide hazard domain seems to be somewhat less attractive than current optimistic expectations.
   In spite of recent achievements, the use of GIS in the domain of prevention and mitigation of natural catastrophes remains a pioneering activity. Diffusion of the technology is still hampered by factors such as the difficulty in acquiring appropriate raw data, the intrinsic complexity of predictive models, the lack of efficient graphical user interfaces, the high cost of digitisation, and the persistence of bottlenecks in hardware capabilities.
   In addition, researchers are investing more in tuning-up hazard models founded upon existing, often unreliable data than in attempting to initiate long-term projects for the acquisition of new data on the causes of catastrophic events. Governmental institutions are frequently involved in risk reduction projects whose design and implementation appear to be governed more by political issues than by technical ones. There is an unfortunate general tendency to search for data which can be collected at low cost rather than attempting to capture the information which most readily explains the causes of a disaster.
   If the technical, cultural, economic and political reasons for this unhealthy state cannot be adequately tackled, the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction will probably come to an end without achieving significant advances in the prediction and control of natural disasters.

AB In this paper we present an application that exploits a geographic information system as a front-end of a complex information system supporting the management of landslide hazard in Valtellina, an alpine valley in Northern Italy.
   A decision support system (EYDENET, operational since October 1996), incorporating a geographic information system and a data interpreter based on artificial intelligence techniques, processes the readings of the 250 most significant instruments of a monitoring net of about 1000 sensors installed on different landslides in several alpine valleys.
   Data gathered by extensometers, clinometers and pluviometers, to check both movements of rocks and climatic conditions which could affect them, are processed by EYDENET, that provides on-line interpretation of data, helps the users analyse them, and generates natural language explanations and alarm messages for the people responsible for the environmental management and the civil protection.

AB A priority task for correct environmental planning is to evaluate Natural Hazards, especially in highly populated areas. In particular, thorough investigations based on different Earth Science techniques must be addressed for the Seismic Hazard Assessment (SHA) in tectonically active areas. Not only the management but also the multidisciplinary analysis of all the SHA-related data sets is best performed using a Geographic Information System. In this paper we show how a research-oriented GIS is built and used in a practical case. The Geochemical Geographic Information System (G(2)IS) was developed and applied to the Gargano promontory (southern Italy) in the framework of an EC research project, the Geochemical Seismic Zonation (GSZ) Project. This multidisciplinary - multiscaling powerful tool is described in its structure, updating procedures and manipulation techniques. Preliminary results are presented on the detection of geochemically active fault zones and their correlation with remote sensing data and other evidences of seismogenic structures.

AB Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression might vary by geographical region due to differences in the spectrum of HIV-related illnesses and (access to) health care. Therefore, the effect of geographical region, next to the effect of other potential cofactors, on disease progression in 664 injecting drug users (IDU) with documented HIV seroconversion from eight cohorts in Europe was studied.
   Methods Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed to assess the effect of geographical region, other sociodemographics, drug use and repeated HIV exposure on progression from HIV seroconversion to immunosuppression, AIDS and death with AIDS. We considered the confounding effect of study-design related factors (e.g. setting of follow-up), and accounted for pre-AIDS death from natural causes by imputing when each endpoint would have occurred, had they not died without AIDS.
   Results Estimates of progression to AIDS and death with AIDS were substantially faster after taking pre-AIDS mortality into account. Median incubation time from seroconversion to the first CD4 count <200 cells/mu l was 7.7 years (95% CI : 7.1-8.3) and to AIDS 10.4 years (95% CI : 9.8-infinity). The 10-year survival was 70.3% (95% CI : 62.8-76.6). The relative hazards (RH) of AIDS for IDU from central and southern Europe compared with IDU from northern Europe was 1.9 (95% CI : 1.2-3.0) and 1.2 (95% CI : 0.6-2.3), respectively, before, and 1.5 (95% CI : 0.7-3.2) and 1.1 (95% CI : 0.6-2.3) after taking differences in study-design related factors into account. Accounting for these factors, the RH of death with AIDS was 0.9 (95% CI : 0.3-2.5) for central and 1.2 (95% CI : 0.4-3.4) for southern Europe compared with northern Europe. For the first CD4 count <200 cells/mu l these figures were 0.8 (95% CI : 0.5-1.4) and 0.8 (95% CI : 0.5-1.4). Age at seroconversion was the strongest predictor of disease progression. No statistically significant differences in disease progression were found by gender, foreign nationality, drug use and potential repeated HIV exposure.
   Conclusions We found no evidence for regional variability in HIV disease progression among European IDU. Future studies evaluating geographical differences should consider the confounding effect of study-design related factors and differential non-AIDS mortality. As age is an important determinant of disease progression, it should be considered in recommending treatment.

ID POLICY
AB State policy designed to stimulate reluctant local governments to take risk reduction actions has mixed results. Incentive and collaborative policies meet with considerable variation in local responses. Direct state regulatory policy is effective in especially high risk areas, but has limited geographic coverage. Planning mandates induce widespread local response to natural hazards, but local implementation varies considerably, with differences in the effects of mandated design features. The article suggests that different regulatory and incentive policy mixes be used to entice local involvement. Policy mixes should be adapted to the differences in local governments' commitment and technical capabilities.

AB Land use describes human activities on the earth, and forms a major element of the terrestrial ecosystem modified by humans in the Himalayan region, where developmental activities are increasing rapidly to support the tourism infrastructure. The unprecedented growth in population is putting extremely high pressure on the limited land available for cultivation. Land use and agricultural practices have undergone drastic changes since the mid-1960s through the introduction of development programmes and the application of various newly developed techniques in agrosciences. An analysis of the land use as it has occurred over the last 70 years suggests that it and property rights in the Upper Beas Basin are complex and dynamic. For example, people are giving importance to orchards because of their high profitability. Thus, some agricultural land has been encroached on by orchards. In addition, wastelands are now being used by people for orchards, agriculture and residential and commercial building. Since the Upper Beas River Basin is mountainous, it is fragile and prone to processes like soil erosion, slope instability, landslides and floods. Risks from natural hazards are increasing. However, the state of ecohydrological responses highlight that human-induced ecological changes can be largely proved at the microwatershed level. The findings are not extended to the Himalayan scale. There is also an uncertain correlation between anthropogenic activities (deforestation) in the mountains and hazards in the plains such as floods. Owing to a lack of basic research, there is little effective information which cannot be used for long-term effective monitoring of ecological and hydrological responses to global change. Such an uncertain situation calls for integrated watershed management and development using geographical information systems (GISs). (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Landslides are common in steep mountainous areas of Puerto Rico where mean annual rainfall and the frequency of intense storms are high. Each year, landslides cause extensive damage to property and occasionally result in loss of life. Average population density is high, 422 people/km(2), and is increasing. This increase in population density is accompanied by growing stress on the natural environment and physical infrastructure. As a result, human populations are more vulnerable to landslide hazards. The Blanco, Cibuco, and Coamo study areas range in surface area from 276 to 350 km(2) and represent the climatologic, geographic, and geologic conditions that typify Puerto Rico. Maps of recent landslides developed from 1:20,000-scale aerial photographs, in combination with a computerized geographic information system, were used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of shallow landslides in these areas. Several types of landslides were documented-rainfall-triggered debris flows, shallow soil slips, and slumps were most abundant. Hillslopes in the study area that have been anthropogenically modified, exceed 12 degrees in gradient, are greater than 300 m in elevation, and face the east-northeast, are most prone to landsliding. A set of simplified matrices representing geographic conditions in the three study areas was developed and provides a basis for the estimation of the spatial controls on the frequency of landslides in Puerto Rico. This approach is an example of an analysis of the frequency of landslides that is computationally simple, and therefore, may be easily transferable to other settings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Environmental protection and improvement comes at a price, and regulators must ensure that resources are targeted at the highest priority risks. Risk assessment at a strategic level is now an essential tool. Risks can arise from natural sources such as flooding and radon, as well as anthropogenic sources such as discharges of pollutants or the introduction of alien fish species. In deciding which environmental pressure to tackle next, and which to leave, regulators have to compare the full range of risks on a sound and consistent basis. Comparing risks from such diverse sources poses a significant challenge and traditional hazard assessments are now no longer sufficient. Consideration now needs to be given to a much wider range of factors if risk assessment is to be used as an aid to strategic decision-making. In general, Strategic Risk Assessment can be broken down into four main tasks. (i) Harm assessment-where the impact of a given level of exposure on a predefined receptor group is determined. (ii) Risk significance-where the harm evaluated in (i) is placed in the geographical (regional, national international) context in relation to the overall population of receptors, and the range of different receptors. (iii) Risk uncertainty-where the probability of occurrence, exposure and harm is quantified together with the range of uncertainties involved in the overall assessment. (iv) Risk importance-where the costs and benefits of various actions/options together with a measure of society's view of the risk are brought together. All the above have been included in the Strategic Risk Assessment Methodology which has been developed by the Environment Agency, and will be used to direct the organisation's manpower and financial resources to maximise its contribution to sustainable development.

ID RAINFALL; MODEL
AB An effective framework for drought assessment requires a definition of drought severity, a weather-soils database for the relevant region in a geographic information system (GIS), a reliable crop growth model, a method of forecasting daily weather data fr om the present date fill the end of the growing season and a mapping procedure for the graphical representation of a dr ought situation. The development and main features of such a framework (system) which is already in use in the Free State Province of South Africa, is described. Based upon the phase of the southern oscillation index, it has been applied to quantify and map drought hazard in maize by running maize crop growth models in a GIS. Input and output data for the latter are grouped in 9800 homogeneous natural resource zones. For each, computed maize grain yield forecasts are compared against long-term cumulative probability distribution functions of yield to determine their probabilities of non-exceedence and used to delimit drought severity areas accordingly. The system enjoys wide acceptance and credibility in the province. To date, the results have been well received by a rapidly growing number of users, now totalling 360. Major users are grain merchants, importers and exporters, millers, the provincial government and maize producers. No tests of accuracy of the forecasting system have been possible at this stage because the computation procedures and software have only just been completed. A similar project has, however, yielded promising results. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE international cooperation; snow avalanches; avalanche mapping and
   protection
AB Due to its geographical location, geology and topography, Turkey mainly undergoes three different types of natural disasters related to gravity flows. They are floods, landslides and snow avalanches.
   The heavy snow falls during winter pose the hazard of snow avalanches. According to statistics, 800 people were killed in snow avalanches during the period of 1960-1997. Within the program of the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (1990-2000), an international cooperation has been initiated among SFISAR (Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research), CEMAGREF (Centre National du Machinisme Agricole du Genie Rural des Eaux at des Forets) and AFET (Turkish Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, General Directorate of Disaster Affairs). This three-year project started in 1994 as a development project on avalanche forecasting, mapping, zoning and paravalanche construction technologies. For the pilot project area, the Soganli Mountains located in north-eastern Turkey were chosen, covering an area of approximately 40 by 30 km. After training the Turkish engineers, the basic technologies in avalanche forecasting and avalanche mapping were transferred from Switzerland and France to Turkey with the necessary infrastructure. The difficulties faced in meteorological data collection with the help of local observers and the Limited data available caused some delay in avalanche forecasting. If automatic weather stations could take the place of manual work the realization of a prognosis would be quicker. At present, avalanche-hit houses are rebuilt in new disaster-free zones by AFET. With this project, the idea of using paravalanche structures for protection is promoted. The physico-sociological impacts of avalanche disasters, avalanche mapping and zoning of disaster areas on local people are also studied.

AB After a brief review of the previous studies and a description of the geographical setting of the Changjiang River, the Changjiang River delta, and the Changjiang River estuary, this paper first summarizes the geological framework in which the recent vertical tectonic movement is emphasized because of its close connection with relative sea level changes and earthquakes. A systematic description of the stratigraphy reveals the local geologic history. Sedimentary sequences, facies and structures since the Holocene are next briefly reviewed. The historical delta and coast development is examined, with special reference to the coastal response to sediment supply. Recent achievements on the physical and biological processes in estuarine and coastal waters are presented. These processes are found to greatly influence the temporal and spatial variation of water salinity, suspended sediment concentration, sedimentation rate, and primary productivity. The interaction of natural processes with socioeconomic development is discussed in detail, with an emphasis on the major problems of estuarine freshwater resources and the impact of water diversion, harbors and navigation channels, land shortage and the impact of land reclamation, subsiding ground surface, rising sea level and flood hazards. Finally, the probable delta development in the coming decades in response to several large scale engineering works is discussed, such as the Three-Gorges Dam, the planned water transfer to North China, and the Deep Water Navigation Channel.

   ASSESSMENT
AB In the past decade, numerous sights across North America have been found which contain abnormal levels of deformed amphibians. This deformation was not limited to species, geography, or climate and spanned a wide range of phenotypes. This report begins to explain these findings by examining the effects of pesticide degradation in early amphibian development through directly exposing Xenopus laevis embryos to trace levels of synthetically prepared degradates. This method specifically determines the risk posed by each individual chemical resulting from the natural fate of the host pesticide. Through this approach, we find that while the common insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, poses minimal developmental determent, products of its reaction with sunlight, water, and microorganisms dramatically interfere with normal amphibian development. The addition of 1 mu L/L of several of S-methoprene's degradates to the environment of developing embryos resulted in juveniles with deformation similar to that found naturally. Current developmental assessments examine only the risk posed by host pesticides. This study now suggest that the simple examination of the these materials is not sufficient, but now forward the need for critically examining the temporal relation between both development and chemical degradation.

DE internet; natural hazards; coursework
AB Use of the Internet is proliferating rapidly, with mounting speculation as to the practical applications for teaching in higher (and other sectors of) education, yet few published or evaluated case studies are available. This paper explores the use of Internet sources on geography courses. For various academic, logistic and philosophical reasons that are discussed, students were not given full access to the Internet, but were exposed to a variety of current Internet-sourced material downloaded onto a network fileserver, and encouraged to communicate internally and externally using electronic mail. This procedure maintained some of the vitality and stimulation of open access to the Internet, whilst providing some control over potential dangers inherent in this untested teaching medium. Evaluations of the student coursework performance on, and perception of, courses involving the Internet indicate no significant impairment in either during the first staging of the course, but substantial improvement in both, relative to similar modules running concurrently, during the second year of operation. We suggest that controlled use of the Internet provides both lecturer and student with practical exposure to this medium with low academic risk and minimal costs, which may lead to enhanced learning.

AB Vulnerability assessments are widely employed to assist planning for major natural disasters in many cities, including metropolitan Tokyo, Continuing assessments carried out by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government use geographical information systems as analytical tools. They rely almost exclusively on data about the physical environment, on counts of human numbers at risk and on information about selected economic dimensions of hazard, Other vitally important aspects of social vulnerability are neglected. As a first step towards developing improved socially sensitive vulnerability assessments, three universities in Japan and the USA have initiated a pilot study of vulnerability to cyclones and earthquakes among the homeless population of Tokyo, This is intended to develop a reliable model of social vulnerability among one marginalized group that can be used to improve disaster planning and management among the homeless and other 'special needs' groups in megacities at risk throughout the world.

ID NATURAL DURABILITY
AB Data about untreated wood exposed in the Nordic test fields from 1943 and onwards have been evaluated concerning differences in microbial activity between and within fields, durability of some wood species in different fields. Data have been supplemented with new field tests with mini stakes and tests in terrestrial microcosms (TMCs) with unsterile soils. Results show that the deterioration of untreated wood exposed in fields in the Nordic countries is more dependent on local occurrence of different types of wood decay than on geographical location. Dominating types of attack in exposed stakes differ between fields and the hazards within a field can vary. No correlation between density and durability within a wood species was found. Results of exposure of wood stakes in TMCs with soil from the test fields correspond relatively well with results from field tests, and analysis of the TMC stakes increases the understanding of varying decay processes occurring during field testing.

   the Asia-Pacific region - awareness and mitigation
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE
AB The fast-growing, coastal megacities of the Asia-Pacific region are expanding into areas that are vulnerable to marine-related physical natural hazards, or, because of physical environmental changes, will become increasingly vulnerable within the timescale of city planning. The hazards comprise those that are due to extreme events such as storm surge and tsunami which may be catastrophic in their impacts; and those that relate to continuing changes over the long-term, notably global sea-lever rise, sedimentary consolidation and coastal erosion. The latter may be exacerbated by human activities such as the increasing production of 'greenhouse' gases and over-abstraction of groundwater, and, while not threatening catastrophic loss of life or destruction of property, do have important economic and social implications for the future.
   There are two complementary approaches to hazard mitigation - constraining the hazard, and reducing vulnerability to the hazard. The contributions that science can make in the planning and implementation of sustainable adaptive measures are to improve the quantification of the incidence and severity of the various hazards, establishing realistic timescales of incidence, estimating return periods; and to establish the geographical limits of vulnerability to the hazards in a range of likely scenarios over timescales appropriate to the planning cycle. Contemporary, high risk, hazard scenarios for existing city developments demand an approach which focuses on effective warning networks and emergency planning; long-term, incremental hazards that are forecast to affect both developed and periurban areas can be addressed with a strategic planning approach, involving relocation and capital protective works. The selection of strategic measures demands the best possible predictive information on hazards and on vulnerability, including its full socio-economic evaluation so that the costs and benefits of the possible mitigation options can be realistically assessed. A predictive capacity, developed through modelling, requires the collection of reliable baseline and monitoring data relating to the hazards over a range of timescales in local, regional and global perspectives.

ID HIMALAYA
AB Landslides are a common natural hazard in mountainous terrain like the Himalaya. In the present study, an area of 445 sq km around Dehra Dun and Mussoorie in Uttar Pradesh has been considered for landslide hazard analysis on a geomorphological basis. The analysis involves classification of the terrain into homogeneous units (terrain mapping subunits) based on relevant geomorphic parameters, and consequently the geomorphic processes including occurrence of landslides. The hazard in these units is evaluated on the basis of field settings. Decision rules for the allotment of a hazard score to a unit have also been framed. The data on geomorphological complexes, lithology, drainage density, relief and landslide distribution were used in a geographical information system (GIS) for the analysis. A final landslide hazard map with four classes - very high, high, low and very low has been prepared. Such a map proves extremely useful as a first generation map for planning detailed surveys in the high hazard areas. The effect of human interference on the environment, particularly depletion of the forest cover has been studied. The landuse/land cover data for a period of 60 years were analysed in a GIS to study the changes in the forest cover. The forested areas account only for 9% of the landslide occurrence. About 60% of the landslides are in non-forested areas that were forested in 1930.

AB Earthquakes, tropical cyclones and floods are the most important natural perils in terms of human deaths on a global basis. In Australia, at least 4300 deaths in the last 200 years have been produced by heat waves; about 2000-2200 each by tropical cyclones and floods; and bushfires and lightning strikes have each killed at least 650 people. On a global basis it appears that floods, tropical storms, droughts and earthquakes are the most damaging natural perils. In Australia, in terms of median damage per event, hailstorms are the most expensive insured natural peril, while three events-the 1989 Newcastle earthquake, 1974's Cyclone Tracy, and the 1990 Sydney hailstorm-produced 36 per cent of the total insured damage in the period since 1967. The Newcastle earthquake and the Sydney hailstorm have provided opportunities for new understandings of these perils and their consequences. While much has been learnt from the devastation of Rabaul town by the 1994 eruption, a rare opportunity for a detailed study of building damage has been lost. Without detailed studies, risk rating, where Risk = Hazard (or peril) x Vulnerability, is difficult.

AB In addition to the traditional activities such as fishing and transportation, a steady growth in world trade, recreation, and exploration of underwater resources has caused a rapid growth in vessel traffic for several decades. This has increased the potential risk of marine casualties involving loss of life and damage to vessels, cargo, navigational aids, and structures (e.g. bridges). Various Asian, European, and North American countries have enacted a wide array of safety measures to reduce the casualties. For instance, the U.S. Coast Guard requires all incoming vessels to have a local pilot on board, have an officer on the bridge, and that the vessel operator should establish radio communications with the Coast Guard after getting on board. In addition, traffic separation lanes and convergence points have been established to improve traffic flow. Navigational aids assist the vessel operators by sensing oncoming traffic hazards such as bridges and shallow waters. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers keeps ship channels open by regularly dredging waterways that are used for commercial traffic. In many countries, offshore deep water ports similar to the loop in New Orleans, Louisiana, have been constructed to reduce traffic near shallow and congested ports. In spite of all these safety measures, accidents do happen. In this paper, we study the historic data related to the vessel accidents over a period of several years. In particular, we focus on the distribution of sizes of the oil spills that have occurred during these accidents. The sizes of the oil spills are ranked from largest to smallest. The regression analysis showed a strong linear relationship between the natural logarithm of size of casualty and the natural logarithm of its rank. The regression coefficients may indicate the 'degree of damage' in a particular year or for a specific geographic region under investigation. It could be argued that they could be used to assess an aggregated impact of the implemented safety measures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The objective of the NRP 31 is the detailed study of the mechanisms and consequences of future climate changes in the Swiss environment, and the resulting interactions between climate, the water cycle, natural hazards, ecosystems and society.
   This programme should help improve our understanding of the response of the environment to abrupt short-term climatic events and to long-term climate changes, and provide answers to economic and political decision making. The emphasis of research will be on processes acting on the regional scale, especially in the Swiss Alps. Consequences of climate changes on the cryosphere and the hydrosphere are exposed, according to the announced evolution of the parameters temperature and precipitation.
   NRP 31 is an attempt to bring together specific projects in especially sensitive geographical test-zones, as representative as possible of Swiss conditions.

AB The political economy of agriculture literature increasingly focuses research on production-consumption relations of different agro-food systems. This paper examines contextual pressures facing orchardists in the globally oriented apple complex of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. The paper details the emerging political economy of orcharding in the crisis conditions of the 1990s under the joint influences of globalization forces, interest in sustainability principles, and disruptive natural hazard events. New regulatory politics embracing apples is implicated in attempts to reinsert the regional apple complex into the global fresh fruit industry. Developments in Hawke's Bay are shown to be embedded in wider processes (including those of regulation) stretching across nations and are affected by conflicting spatialities of operational geographies of agents. Accommodating the risk of the apple sector appears to be closely tied to supportive networking in which investors are gradually refashioning the apple sector into a buyer- or consumer-driven production complex.

AB Bangladesh is a very flat delta built up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna/Barak river systems. Because of its geographical location, floods cause huge destruction of lives and properties almost every year. Water control programs have been undertaken to enhance development through mitigating the threat of disasters. This structural approach to flood hazard has severely affected floodplain fisheries that supply the major share of protein to rural Bangladesh, as exemplified by the Chandpur irrigation Project. Although the regulated environment of the Chandpur project has become favorable for closed-water cultured fish farming, the natural open-water fishery loss has been substantial. Results from research show that fish yields were better under preproject conditions. Under project conditions per capita fish consumption has dropped significantly, and the price of fish has risen beyond the means of the poor people, so that fish protein in the diet of poor people is gradually declining. Bangladesh is planning to expand water control facilities to the remaining flood-prone areas in the next 15-20 years. This will cause further loss of floodplain fisheries. If prices for closed-water fish remain beyond the buying power of the poor, alternative sources of cheap protein will be required.

AB Vegetation patterns and dendrochronology were used to study landforms and processes in three unique geographic areas. Specifically, we report on geobotanical associations related to forest fires, slope failures, rivers, and glaciers. The work was conducted in the Niobrara valley of the Great Plains of Nebraska, Tensleep Canyon of the Bighorn Mountains, Yellowstone-Teton fire areas of the Snake River drainage in Wyoming, and the Nanga Parbat and Batura areas of the western Himalaya. Results indicate that geobotanical associations can be used to provide additional information to study landforms, natural hazards, and sediment yields. In addition, geobotany can be used to detect processes responsible for environmental change. Remote sensing technology can play an important role in detecting vegetation distributions and green biomass variations.

AB The treatment of idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy remains an enigma. We have reviewed many of the important clinical trials concerning membranous glomerulopathy using a meta-analysis and a secondary pooled analysis to test the effects of corticosteroid or alkylating therapy compared with no treatment on renal survival and complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome, A search was performed using MEDLINE (1968 through 1993) for articles on idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy and glomerulonephritis. Bibliographies of articles were reviewed for completeness. Sixty-nine articles were reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed for four trials that evaluated corticosteroids compared with no treatment and for three trials that evaluated alkylating therapy compared with no treatment, Pooled analysis was performed on randomized and prospective studies (10 studies) and then with 22 case series added. All studies evaluated renal biopsy-proven disease. Meta-analysis was performed on the relative chance of being in complete remission for each study. Renal survival could be evaluated by pooled analysis only. For pooled analyses, Cox's proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to test the effect of therapy on renal survival and the nephrotic syndrome, respectively. Data concerning gender, nephrotic syndrome, and geographic region were used in all statistical models. Evaluation of renal survival revealed no differences by treatment group (P > 0.1). By meta-analysis, the relative chance of complete remission was not improved for corticosteroid-treated patients (1.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 2.44; P > 0.1), but was improved for patients treated with alkylating agents (4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.44 to 15.96; P < 0.05) when compared with no treatment. Pooled analysis of randomized and prospective studies, as well pooled analysis with all studies, supported the findings of the meta-analysis. Corticosteroids or alkylating therapy did not improve renal survival in idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy. Complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed more frequently with the use of alkylating agents. (C) 1995 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

TI TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC - SPATIAL PATTERNS AND
   RELATIONSHIPS TO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION AND SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA English
DT Article
ID REGION
AB An analysis of a 20-yr dataset of tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific has been made to determine the spatial patterns of cyclone occurrence and how these depend on the Southern Oscillation (SO) and sea surface temperature. A local measure of cyclone incidence is defined as the number of cyclones that enter into a 2 degrees lat-long square during some period (e.g., within one season) and this quantity is mapped for four Southern Oscillation index (SOI) categories. The maps show that the geographical distribution of cyclone incidence shifts eastward and northward during negative SOI phases and vice versa. The mean annual incidence for the whole region is 28% higher than average for our strongly negative SO category and 16% below average for our near-zero category.
   To explore the roles of the SO and local SST, correlation analysis was applied to mean values of cyclone incidence for four subregions of 20 degrees longitude width between 10 degrees and 22 degrees S. Markedly different SOI/SST responses were found on either side of 170 degrees E. In the Coral Sea subregion (150 degrees-170 degrees E), seasons with a relatively high tropical cyclone incidence were preceded by significant positive anomalies in SST and weak positive anomalies of the SOI. The behaviors of the three eastern subregions (lying between 170 degrees E and 130 degrees W) were similar to each other, but were very different to that of the Coral Sea subregion. Their seasons of higher cyclone incidence were preceded by significant negative anomalies of SOI and Tahiti pressure,which continued into the cyclone season, but with only weak or nil SST relationships. Analysis of variance was used to determine the relative contributions of the main variables for each subregion. Altogether, SOI/SST variables before the cyclone season can explain from 20% to 50% of the variance for the individual subregions. Concurrent variables can explain 70% of the variance for the three eastern subregions taken as a single unit.
   On the basis of these statistical results, the authors proposed that the primary influence on tropical cyclone incidence west of 170 degrees E is the local oceanic conditions, as represented by SST, while to the east of 170 degrees E it is the eastward extent of favorable atmospheric conditions, as indicated by the SOI or Tahiti pressure. The results have application to seasonal cyclone forecasting and natural hazard assessment and mitigation activities within the region.

AB Objective: To characterize the associations of age and progression rates to AIDS-defining neoplasms and opportunistic infections (OI) in HIV-infected homosexual men.
   Methods: Data from 407 homosexual men with documented dates of HIV seroconversion participating in cohort studies from four geographic locations were merged. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were conducted with respect to the association of age with time from seroconversion to the first AIDS-defining neoplasm and OI.
   Results: Among the 307 participants, 139 (34%) were diagnosed with AIDS; 45 (11%) with neoplasms and 90 (22%) with OI. Older age at seroconversion was significantly associated with faster progression to neoplasms, but not to OI. For each 10-year increase in age the risk for neoplasms increased 1.65-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.43], after adjustment for clinical treatments. For OI this risk estimate was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.72-1.34).
   Conclusions: Increasing age is associated with faster progression to AIDS-defining neoplasms, but not with progression to OI. This has not been previously reported and may explain conflicting results in other studies among homosexual men that considered AIDS as a single entity. Our findings suggest that age and AIDS manifestations should be considered, particularly in the context of natural history studies, clinical trials and mathematical modelling.

TI AN ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO HEALTH RISK - A CASE-STUDY OF URBAN ELDERLY
   HOMELESS PEOPLE
SO PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING
LA English
DT Article
ID OLDER
AB The purposes of this paper are:  to describe an ecological approach to assessing health risk, and to apply the approach to a sample of elderly homeless within the context of a single day in a single urban setting.  In the approach described, a method of progressive contextualization was used by adding different hazards to the risk profile in a single geographic area.  The various hazards were applied to the same time and space frame, that of a 24-hour period and in the urban space used by elderly homeless people.  Incorporated into the approach are the concepts of high-risk areas and space-time geography, and the theory of disease ecology.  The spatial-temporal distribution of resources, factors in the natural environment (patterns of daylight and dark and ambient temperature) and factors in the human-created environment (traffic and crime patterns) were identified as important hazards within the urban environment.  Homelessness itself, the effects of aging, the social milieu, and behavior patterns commonly seen in homeless people-particularly, alcohol abuse-were identified as important hazards for elderly homeless people.  Each hazard's spatial-temporal pattern within the 24-hour period is discussed.  Then the convergence of hazards forming an interactive effect is discussed.  Finally, approaches to nursing interventions aimed at reducing risk are presented.

TI Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario Region: Intermittent scattered activity,

SO GEOSCIENCE CANADA
LA English
DT Article
ID CANADA
AB Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario region (1840-1991) were examined for geographical groupings of possible significance for seismic hazard assessment. Prior to the 1970s, the earthquake locations were too inaccurate to support any geographical pattern of epicentres or to justify any correlation with other proposed geological or geophysical trends. For the period of best earthquake monitoring (1970 to 1991), most of the natural earthquakes were scattered under and south of Lake Ontario, with very few near its north shore and no earthquakes located on the Niagara Peninsula. Earthquakes in the Lake Ontario region are characterized by intermittent scattered activity, with no preferred trends identifiable to date.

TI RESISTANCE POTENTIAL OF FORESTS AND INTEGRATED GEOGRAPHIC
   INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
SO EKOLOGIA-BRATISLAVA
LA English
DT Article
AB The resistance potential of forest stands against natural harmful factors is determined by: the degree of forest site pertinence of the tree species composition, the stand spatial structure and the sanitary quotient of a stand. The basic unit for ascertaining of it is a stand, which does not provide sufficient information in a mountain environment.
   Several hazard rating systems, based on similar principles as the resistance potential of forest stands, have been developed in the United States, Canada and Russia. Some use information obtained by remote sensing or integrated geographic information systems.
   Mapping the indicators of resistance potential of forests is possible at classification units smaller than stands.
   It is concluded that creation of the maps of the resistance potential of forests is possible. Combining information obtained by remote sensing with available maps and from other data sources in integrated geographic information systems would probably be the best way.

AB The hypothesis tested in this study is that neighborhoods with multiple technological and behavioral hazards have lower-quality ratings than do neighborhoods with a single massive technological hazard. More than 280 households were surveyed in a heavily industrialized eight-square-kilometer area southwest of Philadelphia. Respondents who gave a low rating to the area listed multiple hazards, especially crime, as distressing characteristics. Respondents who characterized the area as excellent or good rated their previous neighborhood as poor. Geographical theory should explain how different populations perceive behavioral, technological, and natural hazards at the neighborhood scale.

AB In a prospective cohort of 2,647 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive homosexual men enrolled in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh, 891 developed clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) between June 1984 and January 1992. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine temporal trends in survival after AIDS for specific diagnoses, controlling for level of immunosuppression at diagnosis, age, race, and geographic location. Median survival time following AIDS onset increased from 11.6 months in 1984-1985 to 19.5 months in 1988-1989; for those diagnosed in 1990-1991, the median survival time dropped to 17.2 months. Trends in improved survival were diagnosis-specific. Survival after Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia consistently improved from 1984 to 1991 (p < 0.001). Compared with men diagnosed in 1984-1985, those diagnosed with P. carinii pneumonia in 1990-1991 had one-tenth the hazard of dying. For men with greater than or equal to 100 helper T-lymphocytes (CD4+ cells) when diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, the relative hazards (95% confidence intervals) of dying after Kaposi's sarcoma were 0.8 (0.42-1.60) in 1986-1987, 0.7 (0.34-1.58) in 1988-1989, and 0.6 (0.19-1.61) in 1990-1991 compared with those diagnosed before 1986. Men with <100 CD4+ cells when diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma did not demonstrate a consistent change in their subsequent survival. After a nonsignificant (p > 0.05) initial improvement in prognosis, there has not been a significant improvement in survival for men who presented with other opportunistic infections. Observed increases in overall survival probably relate to improved treatment of patients who develop P. carinii pneumonia. Limited improvement in survival following other AIDS diagnoses indicates the need for developing effective treatment against these diseases.

TI FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TIME UNDER QUARANTINE FOR SWINE HERDS IN THE
   VOLUNTARY PHASE OF THE ILLINOIS PSEUDORABIES ERADICATION PROGRAM
SO PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID AUJESZKYS DISEASE VIRUS; ELIMINATION; INFECTION
AB The association of herd characteristics and intervention strategies with time under quarantine was evaluated for 163 farrow-to-finish swine herds enrolled in the voluntary phase (1986-1987) of the pseudorabies virus (PRV) eradication program in the state of Illinois (USA). Vaccination was the intervention strategy used most widely (69% of herds), particularly in larger herds. Depopulation was used primarily when PRV seroprevalence was high, and test-and-removal when seroprevalence was low. Approximately 50% of the herds were released from quarantine within 3 years of developing a herd clean-up plan.
   Multiple regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model indicated the following. Vaccination had a strong association with a longer time until release from quarantine (P < 0.001). This is attributed to the lack of a vaccine differential test during this time, which made diagnosis of natural infection more difficult. Offspring segregation was associated with a longer time under quarantine (all herds: P = 0.05; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.004). Delay in implementation of a herd clean-up plan was also associated with longer time under quarantine (all herds: P = 0.012; non-vaccinated herds: P < 0.001 ). Herds with higher seroprevalence at the time of agreement to a herd plan required a longer time under quarantine (all herds: P < 0.001). This result was apparent for non-vaccinated herds (P = 0.001), and thus is not merely a consequence of vaccination. Herds in areas with a high geographic density of quarantined herds required a longer time before release from quarantine (all herds: P = 0.003), although this trend was not apparent for non-vaccinated herds (P = 0.39). After taking PRV seroprevalence into account, there was no apparent association of time under quarantine with sow herd size (all herds: P = 0.057; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.81) or confinement housing (all herds: P = 0.19; non-vaccinated herds: P = 0.91).

TI TERRESTRIAL PROCESS RESEARCH USING A MULTISCALE GEOGRAPHIC APPROACH
SO PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB Earth systems are interrelated in complex ways which are inadequately understood. An improved understanding of these systems is necessary to develop effective policies for the stewardship and management of our planet. The natural and human systems must be studied together to understand the processes that cause changes on global and regional scales. The understanding gathered must be communicated in a meaningful way to managers and decision makers.
   The United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has developed a priority framework for global change research that is designed to meet the above concerns. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is one of the agencies conducting research into global change with an emphasis on the terrestrial environment. The USGS addresses critical Earth processes using a multiscale geographic approach. This approach has been successful in making significant scientific findings of use not only for modeling of global change but also to support decision making about hazards, resource use, and other environmental issues. It has also supported a strong effort in data management to ensure the diffusion of data and information throughout the scientific and management communities.

TI HUMAN RESPONSES TO RIVERINE HAZARDS IN BANGLADESH - A PROPOSAL FOR
   SUSTAINABLE FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID JAMUNA FLOODPLAIN; EROSION HAZARD; FLOODS; ADJUSTMENTS
AB Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country experienced four abnormally high floods. This study examines causes and impacts of the 1988 flood and evaluates the range of possible human adjustments in mitigating such hazards. Although deforestation and other human modifications of the natural environment, through implementation of flood-related engineering schemes along the upstream reaches of the rivers, may partially cause abnormal floods in the downstream zones, the physical and geographical characteristics of the region provide much of the explanation. It is argued that physical prevention of floods, through means of ''technological fix,'' is likely to pose serious threats to long-term sustainability of floodplain ecology and sociocultural resources of Bangladesh.

AB Gilbert White has had a profound influence on natural resources and hazards research, but the philosophy that guides his work has not been dearly defined. White's approach has broad affinities with the pragmatic tradition of American social thought, most notably with the work of John Dewey. This paper compares four major themes in the work of White and Dewey: the precariousness of existence, the pragmatic conception of inquiry, learning from experience, and discourse and democracy. For each theme, I show how similarities and differences between White and Dewey can help to clarify controversies within geography, and directions for future research.

AB Earthquakes, volcanoes, and hurricanes, together with high population densities and poverty, make the West Indies one of the most vulnerable areas to natural hazards in the world. This paper summarizes the effects and consequences of historic natural disasters within the region and reviews the causes and distribution of these three natural hazards. Suggestions are provided for teachers wishing to utilize information about Columbus or Caribbean geography to introduce their students to a wide array of geographic concepts and questions in physical, environmental, historical, and social geography.

AB Earthquake insurance can reduce potentially disastrous economic losses to households and is therefore a prime method of mitigating against the worst economic effects of damaging earthquakes. The decision to purchase such insurance is a special case in the general study of individual response to uncertainty in the environment. An understanding of this decision process elucidates the ways in which environmental information becomes translated into behavior change. Although California legislation has mandated the disclosure of the availability of earthquake insurance to all residential property owners since 1984, less than half of California homeowners have earthquake insurance. This paper reports on the results of a survey of 3,500 owner-occupiers in Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Los Angeles, and San Bernardino Counties conducted in the summer of 1989. The survey was undertaken to discover the locational concentrations of insurance policy-holders and the socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal characteristics that distinguish insured from noninsured homeowners. The results show that insurance purchase is not spatially related to geophysical risk and that the purchase of insurance is not systematically related to income, equity in the home, age of the head of household, or other socioeconomic characteristics. Instead, perceived risk is the primary factor associated with insurance purchase.

AB Environmental health concerns in the Persian Gulf are peculiar to the geography of the region. Prevention of heat and solar injury deserves primary consideration, but cold injury also may occur in the desert. Immunizations are recommended against a number of diseases, while malarial chemoprophylaxis is necessary in Iraq and Kuwait. In addition to malaria, other parasitic diseases deserve consideration. Diarrheal diseases, diseases from the desert dust, and products of infected desert animals are of concern. Additional natural hazards are venomous bites from scorpions and desert snakes. Finally, threats of enemy action necessitated protection from nuclear biological and chemical weapons and LASER eye/skin injury. Unexploded ordinance will constitute a continuing hazard into the future.

AB This paper considers the role of information technology in forecasting, monitoring and managing disasters in real-time (i.e., by analysis of data as soon as they are collected).  First, the advantages and pitfalls of a technological approach to natural hazards are discussed, then the general nature of real-time technology is described.  There follows a review of the appropriate techniques of monitoring the physical impacts of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods and landslides.  Next the role of information technology in disaster management is assessed, with emphasis on telecommunications and simulation modelling.  As a cautionary note, two notorious failures of prediction and warning are discussed (the strom of October 1987 in England and the volcanic eruption diaster of November 1985 in Colombia), both of which would have benefited from more careful use of real-time monitoring.  It is concluded that microcomputers, earth resources satellites, communications satellites and Geographical Information Systems offer considerable potential for natural disaster management, especially if real-time uses are developed by integrating these technologies.

TI POTENTIAL HEALTH-EFFECTS OF GREENHOUSE-EFFECT AND OZONE-LAYER DEPLETION
   IN AUSTRALIA
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective:  To identify potential health effects of the greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion in Australia.
   Data sources:  Data were derived from a number of sources:  (i) published articles accessed from relevant databases in the disciplines of health, public health and climatology over the past 20 years; (ii) published conference proceedings, review monographs and government reports covering the topic; (iii) a survey of experts in public health and climatology/geography (150 individuals were surveyed in the first phase with a 63% response rate); and (iv) a consensus conference in which 22 invited experts reviewed the results of the literature review and survey and a second conference in which 18 senior members of the health bureaucracy and public health profession considered the implications of the findings.
   Study selection:  Over 200 published articles or monographs were reviewed.  Criteria for selection were whether the papers contributed information to the objectives of the review.
   Data extraction:  Because of the nature of the problem under investigation, predictions based on reasonable scientific assumptions were the major content of the review rather than conclusions based on scientific research.
   Data synthesis:  The major predicted health effects of long-term climatic change in Australia are skin and eye damage from increased ultraviolet radiation exposure, increased incidence of some respiratory diseases, vector-borne and water-borne diseases, and the social and physical effects of natural hazards and social and economic restructuring.  The most vulnerable groups include the aged, the very young, the chronically ill, those living in poorly designed neighbourhoods and those working in outdoor occupations or heavy industry.
   Conclusions:  The potential effects on health of long-term climatic change cover the broad spectrum of public health concerns.  Detailed predictions of likely problems in specific geographic areas are not yet possible, but progressive development of such predictive capability is a high priority.  Doctors will have an increasingly important role in monitoring local health status and participating in disease prevention and surveillance programmes.

TI A GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEM TO ASSESS NATURAL HAZARDS IN THE
   EAST-CENTRAL SIERRA-NEVADA
SO JOURNAL OF IMAGING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Natural hazards such as landslides, avalanches, and shallow groundwater tables are potential areas of risk to life and property in mountainous regions.  Increased development for a growing population and increased recreation use means more damage from these natural hazards is possible in the future.  The east-central Sierra Nevada is such an area.
   Planners desiring to be more effective need to have more information to prevent damage due to hazards of living in underdeveloped mountainous areas.  A Geographic Information System is a computer based technique which offers a way to develop this information on hazards by using a few key variables.  It offers the advantage of using variables in different combinations to address different hazards in the same area, and it shows where these hazards are likely to occur.  This paper describes the selection of the basic processes or attributes of the hazards, assembly of the data base, the analysis, and some examples of the results taken from a test site near Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

DT Article
AB The current debate about such global issues as enhanced greenhouse gas warming should be most attractive to those geographers still interested in integrative issues.  It involves understanding scientific ideas and appreciating the complexities of the world in which remedial measures have to be sought.  Yet geographers have not turned enthusiastically to environmental issues, nor to such integrative topics as natural hazards.  This is good neither for the environmental debate, nor for the future of the subject in its interdisciplinary form.  Where contributions have been made they have not always concentrated on the larger issues, nor fully utilised concepts of scale over time and space.  Geographers should leave tidying the local environment and recycling cans to their spare time and try to get full academic advantage from the current environmental debate.
